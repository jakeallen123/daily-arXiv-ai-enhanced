### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩图像衍生的视差图中的残留噪声来提升高程数据精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探测任务增加，对高质量3D月球地图需求日益迫切。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球覆盖，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的高程不准确问题，影响长距离任务如NASA Endurance任务的安全性。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性的视差噪声模式（特别是在暗区），提出减少压缩图像视差图中残留噪声的方法来增强3D地图质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法能有效减少高程噪声，提升地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著改善Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据支持。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO，但优势来源不明确。通过控制实验发现，CLIP擅长捕捉高级语义特征，DINO更关注低级视觉特征。在VQA任务中，CLIP在文本密集型任务表现更好，DINO在视觉中心任务略胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据，通过控制变量实验来分离这些因素。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO模型，达到相似的ImageNet准确率，然后分析嵌入特征和集成到视觉语言模型中的表现。

Result: CLIP捕捉高级语义特征（如物体类别、文本），DINO对低级特征（如颜色、风格）更敏感。在20个VQA基准测试中，CLIP在文本密集型任务表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务略优。语言监督变体带来的提升有限。

Conclusion: 研究为视觉编码器设计及其对视觉语言模型性能影响提供了科学见解，明确了不同监督方式对特征学习的影响。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用于视觉编码器训练，但在医学影像中应用有限，主要受限于数据不足和领域特定偏差。

Method: 提出乳腺组织感知的数据增强采样器，用于图像级和补丁级监督；引入跨切片对比学习目标，将3D数字乳腺断层合成结构融入2D预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X线摄影的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具提供了可扩展、无需标注的基础，有助于减轻放射科医生的工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安全分析需要复杂的视频理解能力来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故。

Method: 采用双模型框架，将VideoLLaMA专门用于字幕生成任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门用于视觉问答任务，通过分离训练减少任务干扰。

Result: 在WTS数据集上，VideoLLaMA在时间推理方面表现优异（CIDEr得分1.1001），Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解方面表现突出（VQA准确率60.80%），在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2中获得S2得分45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持字幕生成质量，证明了任务特定优化的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net是一种从单张全景图像估计房间3D布局的新模型，结合CNN和薄板样条变换，能有效处理立方体和非立方体房间布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域有重要应用价值，需要能够处理各种复杂房间形状的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先用CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后用TPS变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现出色，3DIoU值分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TPS变换与全景图像兼容性好，模型在处理立方体和非立方体房间布局方面具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于仓库环境空间推理的专用框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中取得第4名成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在大规模3D仓库环境中面临场景杂乱、遮挡和精确空间理解的挑战，依赖局部外观且缺乏显式空间基础，泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）直接嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行任务特定监督的微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案。

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得73.0606的最终分数，排名第4位。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中模型决策的可理解性直接影响临床信任和采用，Vision Transformers的复杂注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer架构，在血细胞分类和乳腺超声分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO与Grad-CAM组合在多个数据集上提供最忠实和局部化的解释，Grad-CAM产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，支持Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APGNet网络用于水下伪装目标检测，通过自适应先验引导机制解决水下图像退化和海洋生物伪装问题，在公开数据集上优于15种先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两个关键挑战：水下图像退化（低对比度和颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装。传统图像增强技术难以恢复退化图像的关键特征，而陆地场景的伪装目标检测方法由于缺乏对水下光学特性的考虑，往往无法适应水下环境。

Method: 提出APGNet（自适应先验引导网络），集成孪生架构和新颖的先验引导机制。使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强生成光照不变图像；设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器捕获多尺度上下文信息；提出自适应先验引导机制，在高层特征中嵌入空间注意力进行粗定位，在低层特征中使用可变形卷积细化轮廓。

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，APGNet在广泛使用的评估指标下优于15种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效解决了水下图像退化和伪装目标检测的挑战，在水下伪装目标检测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidMP3是一个基于扩散模型的视频编辑方法，通过利用姿态和位置先验来学习源视频的通用运动表示，能够在保持原始运动的同时实现结构和语义的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题，需要一种能够同时保持运动并允许结构和语义灵活性的解决方案。

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习通用运动表示，基于扩散模型框架实现运动保持的视频编辑。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，能够生成保持原始运动的新视频，同时允许结构和语义的灵活性。

Conclusion: VidMP3通过运动表示学习有效解决了视频编辑中的时间一致性和身份保持问题，为创作者提供了更大的编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Conclusion: 领域自适应是解决标注数据稀缺问题的有效方法，能够利用已有模型处理不同领域的数据预测任务。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包括用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，通过边缘引导注意力块嵌入显式边缘先验，显著提高解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化模式和锐利边缘的强先验，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer处理严重模糊；设计轻量级LENet处理轻度模糊；集成两者为自适应双网络(ADNet)，根据输入模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 广泛实验表明，EG-Restormer和ADNet在保持竞争性速度的同时实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了严重模糊QR码的解码率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，开发了高效的自适应去模糊网络，特别适合资源受限的移动设备应用。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用平面结构和几何引导来改进3D场景重建的方法，通过生成准确的度量尺度深度图，并在生成流程中整合几何指导来解决现有方法在几何重建和多视角一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法存在两个关键局限：缺乏可靠的几何监督导致重建质量不佳，以及缺乏有效机制来缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致性，导致形状-外观模糊和几何质量下降。

Method: 首先利用平面结构的普遍性生成准确的度量尺度深度图，为观测和非观测区域提供可靠监督；然后将几何指导整合到整个生成流程中，改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并在使用视频扩散模型进行修复时增强多视角一致性。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面始终优于现有基线，特别是在非观测区域。同时支持单视图输入和无位姿视频，在室内外场景中具有良好的泛化性和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 准确的几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提，通过几何指导的整合能够实现准确一致的场景补全，在多种实际场景中展现出强大的适用性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了判别式表示学习（DRL）框架，通过增量并行适配器（IPA）网络和分离锚点监督（DAS）解决非排练类增量学习中的模型复杂度、表示漂移和优化不一致三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中的三个核心问题：模型复杂度增长、增量学习过程中的表示漂移、阶段优化与全局推理的不一致性。

Method: 使用增量并行适配器（IPA）网络构建轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现模型间的并行连接；设计分离锚点监督（DAS）分别约束正负样本与虚拟锚点的比较。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个CIL过程中始终优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了类增量学习的关键挑战，通过轻量级适配器和分离监督机制实现了高效且稳定的增量学习性能。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

TL;DR: 提出SSDiff方法，利用预训练扩散模型生成伪参考人脸，通过分阶段监督（结构引导和颜色细化）实现老照片人脸修复，在真实老照片数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的方法要么依赖显式退化先验，要么依赖全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影或人脸颜色问题。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成伪参考人脸，通过面部解析图和划痕掩码实现选择性修复，采用分阶段监督：结构引导应用于整个去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤进行。

Result: 在包含300张真实老照片的VintageFace基准测试中，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有的GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法通过伪参考人脸和选择性引导，有效解决了老照片人脸修复中的复合退化问题，实现了高质量的修复效果。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛采用引发了对私有图像数据集未授权使用的担忧，传统数字水印方法在此类系统中存在局限性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索键进行保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未授权的数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩单光子3D成像的约束优化方法，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，在硬件约束下显著优于传统编码设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、激光功率、传感器数据率等），压缩直方图虽然解决了数据率问题，但在实际照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保编码函数符合硬件约束（带宽和峰值功率限制）。

Result: 通过广泛仿真验证，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更明显，并能适应任意参数化脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化方法能够设计出实用的编码函数，有效提升压缩单光子3D成像系统在硬件约束下的性能。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: 当前开源模型在通用视觉描述任务上与商业模型存在较大性能差距，限制了数据合成等应用。需要开发成本效益高的解决方案。

Method: 提出CapFlow多智能体协作工作流，利用开源模型进行大规模图像和视频描述合成，然后通过微调获得通用视觉描述器MetaCaptioner。

Result: CapFlow在多个视觉领域实现与GPT-4.1相当的描述质量，成本大幅降低。MetaCaptioner不仅具备与商业模型相当的描述能力，在开源社区达到顶尖多模态性能。

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉描述解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Motivation: 远程生理测量需要收集用户隐私信息，现有非接触式测量依赖标注数据，而现实部署中大量用户数据缺乏标签，难以更新模型。

Method: FedHUG框架包含：(1)最小偏差聚合模块动态调整权重处理多域异构非IID特征；(2)全局分布感知学习控制器参数化标签分布，动态调整客户端训练策略。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达生理测量中，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG有效解决了联邦无监督域泛化问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法用于持续测试时适应，通过知识融合与分裂机制动态管理类感知域知识，解决现有方法中知识遗忘和新知识学习不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在应对下游域数据不规则切换时，存在历史知识灾难性遗忘、新知识学习不足以及有害历史知识干扰等问题，导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出类感知域知识融合与分裂方法KFF，包含知识分裂模块(KFI)从提示池中分离新域知识，以及知识融合模块(KFU)将新知识合并到现有知识池中，采用贪心知识动态合并策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过自适应地扩展和合并类感知域知识，能够动态积累判别性历史知识，有效解决CTTA中的知识管理问题。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Motivation: 传统基于原型的医学图像分割方法使用确定性平均特征，无法捕捉类内多样性，导致泛化能力差

Method: 提出扩散原型学习框架：1)扩散原型增强模块通过前向-反向扩散生成多样化原型变体；2)空间感知条件机制利用原型特征统计的几何属性；3)保守融合策略在保持原型保真度的同时最大化表示多样性

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示显著改进，建立了一次性医学图像分割的最新性能

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程生成多样化变体，有效解决了一次性医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种状态空间提示（SSP）方法，通过帧内聚集和帧间传播模块来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但序列压缩的视觉提示令牌无法充分捕捉视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播时空信息，显著提升了视频理解的性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用框级监督而非密集点级标注，通过师生框架和查询优化策略生成精确的伪掩码，在保持计算效率的同时达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割方法需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂且劳动密集。虽然框级标注作为弱监督形式更易扩展，但重叠区域的模糊性使得点-实例分配具有挑战性。现有两阶段方法增加了训练时间和复杂性，阻碍了端到端优化。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均从学生模型更新。引入基于实例中心的查询优化来增强位置查询定位，利用实例中心附近特征。设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上的广泛实验表明，BEEP3D实现了与最先进弱监督方法相当或更优的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: BEEP3D成功解决了框级监督3D实例分割中的模糊性问题，通过端到端框架和精心设计的损失函数，在减少标注成本的同时实现了高性能的实例分割。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过视觉注意力对齐有效解决了MLLM知识蒸馏中的视觉感知能力传递问题，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DIANet双流框架，通过分别处理起始-顶点和顶点-结束阶段的动态图像，结合交叉注意力融合模块，在微表情识别任务上取得了优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临挑战，因为传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的特征差异，需要更精细的时间建模。

Method: 使用双流框架处理不同时间阶段的动态图像：起始-顶点阶段和顶点-结束阶段，每个流使用专用CNN处理，并通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统的单阶段动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间阶段信息对微表情识别至关重要，为MER领域的发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型推理训练数据集的构建原则，提出了多种数据筛选方法，发现上下文来源策略、辅助信号干预和数据规模扩展对模型性能有显著影响，并基于此构建了HoneyBee大规模推理数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高性能VL推理训练数据集的原则仍不清楚，需要系统研究数据筛选策略对模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 引入多种数据筛选方法，分析上下文来源的影响，实施针对性数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链解决方案的规模扩展。

Result: 发现上下文来源策略显著影响VLM性能，辅助信号干预带来实质性提升，扩展所有数据维度持续改善推理能力。基于此构建的HoneyBee数据集（250万样本）使3B参数模型在MathVerse上分别超越SOTA和基础模型7.8%和24.8%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了改进的VL推理数据集筛选策略，通过系统数据干预和规模扩展显著提升模型推理性能，同时提出的测试时缩放策略可降低73%解码成本而不损失准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Motivation: 提高生成模型的推理效率是商业化应用的关键挑战，但并行预测多个标记可能导致结构不一致问题，传统方法缺乏回溯修正机制。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机标记以提高鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现标记修正，结合自回归序列建模与并行标记预测。

Result: 在ImageNet-256、CIFAR-10图像生成以及UCF-101、NuScenes视频生成任务上均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行标记预测效率优势的同时，显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频两种模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中存在的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动双重挑战，传统人工噪声建模存在分布偏差限制。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用小波引导跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；第二阶段引入真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，在跨域场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声挑战，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的物体/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题，支持视频重建和编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验（如像素级匹配和跟踪），几个像素的跟踪误差就会导致视觉对象表示崩溃，无法处理遮挡和大范围运动。

Method: 使用层次化代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验来缓解不准确跟踪器的影响，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少的参数实现高视频重建精度，支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 代理节点表示方法能够有效处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，提供可控和细粒度的外观编辑能力，是视频表示的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数——乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本等原因存在数据稀缺问题，而传统的交叉熵和Dice损失加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上应用置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优后的加法损失和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下提供更稳健的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制，用于在具有挑战性的数据限制下实现鲁棒的语义分割。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要额外OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 利用ID图像的局部背景特征作为伪OOD特征进行训练，基于卷积的局部不变性提取背景特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有良好的组合兼容性，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型在OOD数据上的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AngularFuse框架，通过跨模态互补掩码、细粒度参考图像合成和角度感知损失，解决可见光-红外图像融合中的细节缺失和亮度不均问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手动设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，以及梯度损失仅关注梯度大小而忽略方向的问题。

Method: 设计跨模态互补掩码模块强制学习模态间互补信息；结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化生成细节丰富、亮度平衡的参考图像；引入同时约束梯度大小和方向的角度感知损失。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度大小和方向，确保融合图像保持纹理强度和正确的边缘方向，展现出优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Motivation: 现有的医学基准主要评估通用医学任务，无法充分评估在脊柱等依赖视觉输入的细分领域的性能，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 通过整合和标准化开源脊柱疾病数据集的图像标签对，构建包含脊柱疾病诊断和脊柱病变定位两个临床任务的VQA基准，并为每个VQA对基于视觉相似性采样具有挑战性的硬负样本选项。

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来脊柱医学应用的改进提供了指导方向。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因为它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键物体分配相同资源。

Method: 引入语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，使用混合重要性度量来简化非关键场景元素；采用基于优先级的深度预渲染管道来剔除被遮挡基元并加速着色计算。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS在安全关键物体上实现了卓越的重建质量，同时显著减少训练时间并将渲染速度提升至350+ FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过将任务感知语义优先级注入3D重建和渲染管道，成功解决了保真度与效率之间的权衡问题，为自动驾驶应用提供了高效的动态场景重建方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于部分相关视频检索(PRVR)的双重学习框架DL-DKD++，通过动态知识蒸馏从大规模视觉语言预训练模型中提取泛化知识，并将其转移到轻量级的任务特定网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法通常假设视频经过预剪辑且只包含文本相关内容，但实际中视频通常是未剪辑的长视频，包含更复杂的背景内容，因此需要解决更实用的部分相关视频检索问题。

Method: 采用双重学习框架与动态知识蒸馏，使用大型教师模型为紧凑的双分支学生网络提供监督。学生网络包含继承分支（吸收教师可转移知识）和探索分支（从PRVR数据集学习任务特定信息）。引入动态软目标构建机制，用自适应的软目标替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上的实验结果表明，所提模型在PRVR任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的DL-DKD++框架通过动态知识蒸馏有效解决了部分相关视频检索问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在无文字logo上的品牌名称幻觉问题，发现模型倾向于依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知，并揭示了投影器子空间在此失败模式中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉，即输出缺乏视觉证据支持。本文特别关注一个被忽视的设置：logo幻觉，即模型在logo不包含可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文字logo的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLM的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强失真情况下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。幻觉与投影器的一小部分维度相关，针对性消融可显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。模型特别容易对标志性圆形logo产生幻觉。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型往往依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知，投影器子空间在此失败模式中起决定性作用。投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个用于语义场景完成的创新框架，通过光流时间对齐和课程学习深度融合，解决了现有方法在运动推理和深度监督方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义场景完成方法依赖时间堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 使用预训练光流对齐多帧的分割、视觉和深度特征；采用课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度逐步过渡到密集立体深度；利用SAM提供类别无关的语义先验。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过运动引导和课程感知设计，有效提升了基于相机的3D语义场景完成能力。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制减少深度神经网络的计算复杂度，特别适用于3D医学影像和超声视频分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法虽然解决了不可微采样问题，但缺乏输入自适应性。

Method: 提出注意力引导的采样模块，即使在推理阶段也能根据输入动态调整采样策略，克服了传统方法只能任务自适应而不能输入自适应的局限性。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括一个真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性，实现了性能提升和复杂度降低。

Conclusion: 该自适应子采样框架能够有效减少深度神经网络的计算负担，同时保持甚至提升性能，特别适用于计算资源受限的医学影像分析应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出STORM-PSR双流框架，结合空间和时间特征来改进程序步骤识别，特别在部分遮挡情况下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧图像中的装配对象状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时鲁棒性和准确性受限

Method: 采用双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流包含空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器，通过弱监督预训练捕捉时空特征

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，相比先前方法分别减少了11.2%和26.1%的装配步骤完成延迟

Conclusion: 时空流不依赖无遮挡物体视图即可推断完成步骤，显著提升了模型在遮挡情况下的识别性能

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

TL;DR: 提出概率化重解释的场景坐标回归训练方法，通过引入重建先验来改善在弱多视角约束下模型退化的问题，包括深度分布先验和基于3D点云扩散模型的场景坐标配置先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景坐标回归模型在训练图像缺乏充分多视角约束时会退化，需要引入高层重建先验来提升模型性能。

Method: 概率化重解释SCR训练，融合多种重建先验：深度分布先验和基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型先验，在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向合理几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，该方法学习到更好的场景表示，产生更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过概率化框架引入重建先验能有效提升场景坐标回归模型的性能，特别是在弱多视角约束条件下。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量转换框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场MRI图像，在减少参数量的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI(LF-MRI)虽然价格便宜且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种方法在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，替代传统的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM在低场MRI重建中实现了最先进的性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒性，且使用的参数显著少于竞争深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，特别适用于资源有限的临床环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，采用分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制，解决了现有方法在时序上下文理解和稀疏帧采样方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统在长视频理解中面临两个主要挑战：难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文，以及稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 提出分层记忆结构，采用从粗到细的渐进粒度，通过基于智能体的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆，直到收集足够信息给出答案。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，基于开源模型的性能甚至超过了GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时序理解和细节保留问题，并引入了EgoMem新基准来全面评估模型能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Motivation: 传统方法依赖单张图像，无法捕捉纵向上下文来生成临床准确的比较陈述。现有综述主要针对单图像报告生成，缺乏对纵向设置的指导，研究人员需要系统性的框架来设计模型。

Conclusion: 总结了当前研究的五大主要局限性，并概述了未来发展的有前景方向，旨在为推进这一新兴领域奠定基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 针对深度伪造检测器在未知模型（黑盒设置）下的防御，现有对抗攻击方法在可转移性和视觉不可感知性方面存在不足。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦视觉显著区域的扰动；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块基于黑盒模型成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本。

Result: 在未见过的检测器上实现了比最先进攻击方法高出27%的错误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联合优化可转移性和不可感知性，有效提升了黑盒设置下对抗攻击的性能。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Result: 综合实验验证了该去模糊方法的有效性，并显示其优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Motivation: 现有神经方法学习UDF存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要更高效稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，通过能量函数优化对齐，然后扩散法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分恢复UDF。

Result: VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、数值稳定的UDF计算方法，适用于各种复杂拓扑结构，优于现有神经方法。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合了IL和RL的优势，超越了传统的两阶段方法，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL

### [56] [MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565)
*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMOT，首个面向无人机多光谱多目标跟踪的基准数据集，包含125个视频序列和48.8万标注，并开发了光谱和方向感知的MOT方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下依赖的空间外观线索（颜色、纹理）容易退化，而多光谱图像能提供像素级光谱反射率信息，增强在空间条件退化时的目标区分能力。但缺乏专门的多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 1) 构建大规模MMOT基准数据集；2) 提出多光谱和方向感知MOT方案，包括轻量级光谱3D-Stem模块、方向感知卡尔曼滤波器和端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 广泛实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集排列物体的跟踪效果改善明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和多光谱跟踪方案将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，通过将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，解决现有基于交叉注意力机制的方法在时间对齐方面的不足，显著提升了时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于时间依赖输入信号的人类运动生成方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制，但这种方法主要捕捉全局交互，难以维持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该模型在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的TCM模型通过改进的时间对齐机制，在人类运动生成任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet植物分类模型、DinoV2骨干网络和SAM分割模型，无需收集新数据集即可实现植物区域的精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型避免收集和标注新数据集的需求。

Method: 使用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细化分割。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在IoU指标上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和植物专用模型可有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过利用扩散模型自身中间表示的差异来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明扩散模型中间表示的质量与生成质量相关，外部指导能加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，探索如何利用模型自身的表示差异来提供内在指导。

Method: LayerSync通过正则化扩散模型的中间表示，利用语义丰富的层指导较弱的层，形成一个即插即用的正则化项，无需额外开销。

Result: 在图像生成上显著提升质量和效率，流式transformer在ImageNet上训练速度提升8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。方法还适用于音频、视频和运动生成。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种自给自足的正则化方法，能有效提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，且具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，用于提升像素空间扩散模型和一致性模型的性能，通过在ImageNet数据集上取得优异结果，显著缩小了与潜在空间模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的效率和性能差距。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器从干净图像中捕获语义信息，并将其与确定性采样轨迹上的点对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化的解码器集成，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型达到FID 2.04，在ImageNet-512上达到FID 2.35（75次函数评估），大幅超越先前像素空间方法；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样达到FID 8.82，显著优于其潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功缩小了像素空间与潜在空间生成模型之间的性能差距，首次实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型直接训练。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态潜在推理方法IVT-LR，通过在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息进行推理，显著减少了标注需求并提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高，需要解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中结合潜在文本（前一步的隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定的图像嵌入）来表示每个推理步骤，并采用渐进式多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR方法平均准确率提升5.45%，同时推理速度比现有方法快5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法通过多模态潜在推理有效提升了多模态推理的性能和效率，减少了标注需求。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视水下成像物理原理或将图像退化视为干扰因素，未能充分利用其中包含的有价值信息。

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，S_m指标提升了0.072，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: WaterFlow通过整合物理先验和时间建模，显著增强了水下显著目标识别能力，代码将在接受后发布。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实世界复杂噪声场景中的有效性。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带具有位置相似性和内容一致性的特性，而噪声不具备此特性，开发了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能方面优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效解决真实世界去噪问题，不依赖噪声假设，具有高效和优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的人体网格恢复方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器编码器，计算成本高。希望开发更简单高效的模型，利用分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段特征来优化计算效率。

Method: 构建三种轻量级HMR2.0变体，并利用Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba等分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段作为编码器，仅使用前2-3阶段而非完整模型。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层视觉基础模型的HMR和HPE模型，发现仅使用前2-3阶段就能达到与完整阶段模型相当的性能，且在精度与计算效率间展现出更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人体网格恢复和姿态估计任务，提供比现有轻量级替代方案更好的性能-效率平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Conclusion: 定制化的学习型压缩算法是地球观测领域的有前景方向，代码和模型权重将以宽松许可证发布。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Conclusion: 提出的多无人机协作占用预测框架有效解决了BEV方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低了通信需求，为无人机群系统提供了高效的协作感知解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了带噪声标签的开放集域泛化问题，通过可靠性感知和残差流机制提升了模型泛化能力

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用面临数据共享限制和隐私保护问题，联邦学习虽然能解决数据聚合问题，但仍需有效利用各客户端数据。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果表明，该方法与现有联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域基础模型的联邦微调提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案，能够充分利用分布式数据同时保护患者隐私。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

*Junhao Zhuang,Shi Guo,Xin Cai,Xiaohui Li,Yihao Liu,Chun Yuan,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的单步流式实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器等技术，在A100 GPU上实现约17 FPS的768x1408视频处理速度，比现有单步扩散VSR模型快12倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法存在高延迟、计算量大、对超高分辨率泛化能力差等问题，难以在实际应用中使用。本文旨在实现高效、可扩展且实时的扩散基VSR。

Method: 提出FlashVSR框架，包含三个关键技术：(1) 训练友好的三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率；(2) 局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算并弥合训练-测试分辨率差距；(3) 微型条件解码器在不牺牲质量的情况下加速重建。同时构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的VSR-120K数据集。

Conclusion: FlashVSR通过创新的效率优化技术，使扩散基视频超分辨率变得实用，实现了效率、可扩展性和实时性能的平衡，为高效扩散基VSR的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS框架通过集成视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，解决了场景感知中的分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、数据稀疏性和视角限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案在场景感知、理解和模拟方面仍存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，集成VPS、VO和SR任务：VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；VO结合全景分割结果和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；SR利用VO结果将稀疏点云转换为神经场合成高保真视图。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，基于注意力的特征融合在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视图合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成多个任务，实现了更全面的场景理解，在多个关键任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个用于文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成多样化、经过验证的问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深层语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在评估深层语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，无法捕捉人类视觉查询的多样性和深度，导致模型倾向于利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化的智能体协作生成细致、经过验证且语言多样化的问题，构建的结构化基准涵盖相关视觉理解维度，探究模型解释符号意义、叙事和复杂视觉关系的能力。

Result: 对14个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，揭示了当前模型的显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间明显的性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench基准填补了现有评估工具的空白，突显了当前多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉理解任务中的不足，特别是在文化遗产领域的深层语义分析方面。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让统一多模态模型的理解模块评估和奖励生成模块，实现自我改进，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型中，强大的视觉理解能力往往无法有效迁移到视觉生成任务上，存在理解与生成之间的能力差距。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局的正确性，局部奖励优化细粒度对象级保真度，形成理解模块对生成模块的反馈循环。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上性能从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75，显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制，利用理解模块来指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为E-MoFlow的无监督框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，避免了显式深度估计，在6-DoF运动场景中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经形态视觉（如事件相机）中缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，使得单独解决自运动和光流估计问题成为不适定挑战。现有方法要么引入偏差和计算开销，要么容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 在6-DoF运动场景中表现出色，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至可与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，展示了在通用6-DoF运动场景中的多功能性。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过交叉注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件运动追踪，在多种PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑部PET成像中会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确，而基于硬件的运动追踪在临床实践中应用有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的深度学习模型DL-HMC++，通过监督学习利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动追踪的金标准数据进行训练，直接从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪（HRRT和mCT）和四种放射性示踪剂上评估，DL-HMC++始终优于最先进的数据驱动运动估计方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准HMT难以区分，脑区标准摄取值分析显示平均差异比分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动的PET头部运动校正的潜力，可以消除硬件运动追踪的负担，使运动校正能够应用于研究环境之外的临床人群。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Motivation: 现有基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同类型的特征。

Method: 提出推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需特定编码器训练，可应用于任何视觉特征。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到新的最先进水平，能泛化到不同特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法对特定特征类型的依赖。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了它们是否被良好观测，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 提出不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，估计每个高斯的时间变化不确定性，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化有效解决了遮挡和极端视角下的重建挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

TL;DR: 提出Flow Poke Transformer (FPT)框架，通过稀疏交互直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，无法有效表示多模态场景运动及其对物理交互的依赖关系，以及场景动态的内在不确定性。

Method: 使用Flow Poke Transformer框架，基于稀疏交互（称为"pokes"）直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释且可直接访问的多模态场景运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专业基线；在强分布外任务中微调后，在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在基于pokes的移动部件分割任务中达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，在多个任务中展现出优越性能和灵活性，证明了其方法的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人虚拟形象的过程昂贵耗时，需要复杂的相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家的大量手动工作。现有单图生成方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角信息约束，在偏离参考视角时质量会下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成数百帧的多视角视频（最多360度环绕），然后将输出蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟形象。

Result: 相比先前方法，显著提升了生成虚拟形象的逼真度、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: MVP4D方法在降低数字人创建门槛的同时，通过多视角视频生成和4D蒸馏技术，实现了更高质量的虚拟形象生成。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过Layerwise Attention Pooling机制提取文本和视觉token的语义和细节信息，并提出了VERIFI方法增强推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。先前方法需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 使用冻结的VLM作为统一编码器，提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制提取多层次信息，以及VERIFI方法通过VLM的文本token进行条件生成和推理。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构，能够忠实传递视觉信息。模型在编辑任务上微调后不仅提高了生成质量，还展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计实现了有效的跨模态知识迁移，在单图像编辑训练后能够零样本泛化到多图像参考，验证了该设计的有效性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO是一种新的训练算法，通过视觉一致性学习让多模态大语言模型根据图像语义复杂度自适应调整视觉token数量，可减少50%视觉token同时保持模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同连接器响应间的KL散度，推理时通过视觉分辨率路由器自动选择合适压缩率。

Result: 实验表明该方法能减少最多50%的视觉token，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于开发更高效的MLLMs，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持续性(CMP)集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持续性来生成稳健的拓扑特征向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP虽然为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持续性组合，联合学习双过滤函数。

Result: 在医学影像和计算机视觉基准数据集上，CuMPerLay在分类和分割任务中表现优异，特别是在数据有限场景下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供密集的自监督信号，解决监督不足问题，显著提升驾驶性能并增强数据缩放效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型因稀疏低维动作监督导致的监督不足问题，充分利用模型表示能力。

Method: 提出世界建模训练范式，为离散视觉token使用自回归世界模型，为连续视觉特征使用扩散世界模型，并引入轻量级动作专家解决推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和更大内部数据集上显著超越BEV和VLA基线，性能提升随训练数据量增加而加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模能有效利用VLA模型容量，通过密集自监督信号学习驾驶环境动态，增强数据缩放效应。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的MLLM，通过特殊任务设计、数据引擎和两阶段训练流程，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当的物体检测性能，并具备多种视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MLLM在物体检测任务中面临的低召回率、重复预测和坐标不对齐等问题，弥合传统回归模型与MLLM之间的性能差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示量化坐标；2) 构建多数据引擎生成高质量标注数据；3) 采用两阶段训练：2200万数据的监督微调+基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）的性能。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统开辟了道路，展示了MLLM在物体检测领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够按需进行多轮网络搜索的多模态大语言模型，能够为图像和文本搜索工具动态构建查询，通过两阶段训练方法显著提升了多模态搜索的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要开发能够动态适应真实世界变化信息的多模态搜索模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA多模态VQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪个搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网络搜索，使图像搜索更有效，并能迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，DeepMMSearch-R1通过动态查询构建和迭代优化，显著提升了多模态搜索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题上表现脆弱，主要依赖记忆而非推理。当谜题被轻微修改时，模型性能崩溃，表现出'幻影回忆'现象——自信地复述记忆中的解决方案，即使已不适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在逻辑谜题中的真实推理能力，检验它们是否真正理解推理原理，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本，评估11个主流LLMs，并提供三个工具：自动逻辑等价判断器、细粒度推理错误分类法和提示缓解框架。

Result: 在未修改谜题上准确率接近完美，但在扰动版本上显著低于人类表现，表现出幻影回忆和过度阐述问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文线索变化时往往无法重新推理，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否适合作为世界模型来增强智能体决策，解决其幻觉问题和静态知识依赖导致的长期模拟误差累积。

Method: 提出检索增强世界模型(R-WoM)，通过从外部教程检索事实性、最新知识来增强LLM模拟，评估了三个核心能力：下一状态预测、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别。

Result: R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别实现25.3%和18.1%的显著改进，特别是在长期模拟中表现更优。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能有效捕捉即时状态和重要转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降；R-WoM通过知识检索有效缓解了LLMs的长期模拟限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM对输入的表层形式变化非常敏感，即使语义保持不变，微小的变化也会导致内部真实性表示崩溃，这表明LLM学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM性能脆弱性是否源于内部知识表示的不稳定性，特别是当输入经历语义保持的扰动时，真实性表示如何退化。

Method: 通过应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述）使样本分布外，在四个LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法上评估表示可分离性的退化情况。

Result: 当样本呈现形式与预训练数据相似度降低时，LLM内部真实性表示会崩溃，真实性区分能力高度依赖于语句的确切表层形式。

Conclusion: LLM可能学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，这解释了基准测试性能的脆弱性，并对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但其在机器翻译任务中的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是通过生成中间思考标记来提升翻译质量的可能性。

Method: 在多语言对和不同资源水平下测试中间思考标记的效果，包括使用蒸馏思维链方法微调模型，以及构建模块化翻译策略的中间标记。

Result: 思考标记本身不能帮助LRMs更好地执行机器翻译，但通过模块化翻译策略构建的中间标记可以带来性能提升。标准输入输出微调优于基于思维链解释的微调。

Conclusion: 中间标记在微调过程中的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试。使用教师模型改进目标翻译或扩展平行语料库比蒸馏思维链解释到思考型翻译模型更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码仓库资源训练数学大语言模型，通过将代码分解重组为结构对齐的正式数学陈述，显著提升模型在数学形式化任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化（将非正式数学陈述转化为正式形式）方面表现不佳，主要受限于大规模训练数据的稀缺，特别是包含非正式与正式数学陈述对的数据集。

Method: 提出TopoAlign框架，将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装成结构上镜像正式数学陈述的对应物，生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math模型上，BEq@10性能提升17.77%，typecheck@10提升68.82%；在Herald模型上，BEq@10提升0.12%，typecheck@10提升1.09%。

Conclusion: 即使不引入新的数学知识，在结构对齐的代码数据上训练也能显著提升数学大语言模型的自动形式化能力，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

TL;DR: GRAVITY框架通过生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据来减少对人工标注的依赖，整合了人口统计、文化和心理框架，在跨文化个性化内容生成中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM个性化方法依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，限制了可扩展性且忽略了更深层的用户属性，需要减少对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 引入GRAVITY框架，整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的图书描述生成任务中，GRAVITY相比基于提示的条件化、标准微调和朴素合成对生成方法，实现了超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%的情况下更偏好GRAVITY输出。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户变化，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs（不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询）的自动生成流程，用于创建更具挑战性的RAG基准测试，解决现有基准中多跳和超出范围问题过于简单的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试很少反映真实任务复杂性，多跳或超出范围的问题往往可以通过断开推理作弊解决，或者只需要简单的事实回忆，这限制了发现现有RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了首个自动、难度可控的CRUMQs生成流程，可适应任何语料库和领域，用于创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询。

Result: 在两个流行的RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验结果显示相比之前的RAG基准，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低了高达81.0%。

Conclusion: 该流程提供了一种简单的方法来增强基准测试的难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD)方法，利用LLM中不同层级的功能分工，通过仅使用后期层同时生成多个token，实现推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中早期、中期和后期层分别负责上下文理解、任务处理和输出转换的观察，假设经过前两层处理后得到的隐藏状态已包含足够信息，可直接用后期层生成多个token，避免重复遍历早期和中期层。

Method: 提出DMTD推理范式，无需额外参数、辅助程序或后生成验证。通过对Qwen3-4B模型进行有限数据集的微调实现。

Result: 微调后的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型在仅轻微性能损失下实现了最高2倍的加速效果。缩放分析表明使用更大训练数据集可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有效的推理加速方法，通过利用LLM层级分工特性，在保持性能的同时显著提升生成效率。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过程序化分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，从而在长视野任务中大幅减少上下文使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受限于上下文长度，需要一种有效管理上下文的方法。

Method: 开发了Context-Folding框架和FoldGRPO强化学习算法，通过过程奖励鼓励任务分解和上下文管理，让智能体能够分支处理子任务并折叠中间步骤。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（深度研究和软件工程）上，折叠智能体匹配或优于ReAct基线，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理方法。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，实现了更高效的上下文管理。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架，专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力，发现现有模型的自动形式化性能被高估，并设计了Lean-FIRe方法来改进猜想和自动形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动形式化研究忽视了猜想这一关键前置步骤，许多数学问题需要先猜想结论才能进行形式化。LLMs在自动形式化方面已有困难，而猜想能力的评估又有限且常与形式化或证明任务混淆。

Method: 扩充现有数据集创建ConjectureBench，重新设计评估框架和指标来专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力；设计了推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 评估显示GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1等基础模型的自动形式化性能在考虑猜想因素后被显著高估；使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功端到端形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1形式化了7个。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但改进自动形式化性能需要将猜想视为独立任务，并研究如何正确将其整合到自动形式化流程中。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互式智能体评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务逻辑知识和企业基础设施，生成更真实多样的交互，能发现更多智能体错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟用户方法通常建模通用用户，忽略了领域特定原则，难以捕捉真实用户行为。需要一种结合业务知识的模拟框架来改进智能体评估。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，整合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的企业基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），基于客户角色生成真实交互。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更真实多样，能识别多达33%的智能体错误，证明其作为评估工具在错误发现和智能体迭代改进方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SAGE通过整合业务知识显著提升了用户模拟的真实性和评估效果，为多轮交互智能体的评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭问题日益严重，现有逻辑等价问题生成方法效率低下且难度不均，需要开发更高效、质量更好的自动问题生成系统。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，并开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 实验表明生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当，难度也与教科书问题相似，优于大型语言模型生成的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自动问题生成方法能够高效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，为解决学术不端问题和提供大量练习题目提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

TL;DR: 比较神经符号系统和基于LLM的信息抽取系统在农业领域的表现，LLM系统在F1分数上表现更好（69.4 vs 52.7），但各有优缺点：神经符号系统运行更快、控制性更强，而LLM系统性能更高、部署维护更容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要系统比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、乳制品、作物）的9个访谈上，对比评估神经符号系统和基于LLM的信息抽取系统。

Result: LLM系统总体F1分数69.4（核心63.0），神经符号系统总体52.7（核心47.2），LLM性能更优但运行较慢。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间取得平衡，不能单纯追求性能指标。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CPR框架，通过清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述来减少LLM幻觉，无需外部知识即可显著提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常生成看似合理但错误的"幻觉"事实，主要原因是用户使用结构不良或模糊的提示，导致模型基于假设而非实际意图生成响应

Method: 引入治愈性提示优化框架，使用微调的小型语言模型清理不良提示并生成额外信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示

Result: 应用CPR后显著提高了生成质量并减少了幻觉，在没有任何外部知识的情况下，优化后的提示胜率超过90%

Conclusion: CPR框架有效缓解了由不良提示引起的LLM幻觉问题，通过提示优化显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在幻觉问题上仍面临挑战，而格式不良提示（包含歧义、语法错误或不完整信息）的影响尚未充分研究

Method: MPR框架通过多个阶段系统改进提示，每个阶段针对特定错误（如标点、拼写错误、关键词误用），使用针对这些任务微调的小型语言模型，通过迭代增强提示清晰度并采用带排名的自反机制

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，证明其能有效减少幻觉并提高LLM输出准确性

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可提升LLM在不同领域的可靠性，并能与现有的事后幻觉缓解框架结合使用

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是解决大语言模型幻觉问题的关键研究方向，当前方法已取得进展但仍存在局限，需要进一步研究来完善这一领域。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或描述不足的提示词时，往往导致图像-文本对齐度、美学质量和整体效果不佳。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为提示词重写器，引入精心设计的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，在无需监督微调数据的情况下优化用户输入。

Result: 在多个T2I模型和基准测试中，该方法持续改善了图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且在不同T2I骨干模型间展现出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略，能够显著提升文本到图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了分层对齐方法，针对Transformer模型的不同功能层进行定向优化，避免了传统DPO的"对齐税"问题，在保持语法流畅性的同时显著提升逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法将模型视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层次的功能专门化（从语法处理到抽象推理）。

Method: 分层对齐方法，将模型层划分为局部（语法）、中间（逻辑）和全局（事实性）三个功能块，使用LoRA进行精准微调，对每个功能块应用定向DPO优化。

Result: 局部层对齐提升语法流畅性，全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是增强逻辑一致性的最有效策略，所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中的"对齐税"问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，展示了从整体优化转向结构感知精准微调的巨大潜力，有助于构建更先进可靠的LLM。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：(1) 由于二次自注意力和线性KV缓存扩展导致的内存占用增长；(2) ContextRot现象，即随着上下文长度增加，Transformer架构性能下降。

Method: 提出APCE方法，通过低维语义相似性匹配选择最重要的输入块，直接操作输入数据，不依赖底层硬件或CUDA环境。

Result: 在长上下文摘要任务中，APCE使用50%-70%的输入序列实现了优于或等同于完整密集基线的性能，同时显著改善了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种上下文感知的效率解决方案，有望激发针对其他相关长上下文任务的进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中的性能，在两个数据集上表现出高敏感性和特异性，优于NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest等开源内容审核护栏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，助长破坏性行为，因此需要开发有效的安全过滤器来保护用户。

Method: 使用两个临床医生标注的数据集(Verily精神健康危机数据集和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集)，评估VBHSF的性能，并与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出高敏感度(0.990)和特异性(0.992)，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上保持高敏感度(0.982)和准确度(0.921)。在所有情况下都显著优于对比方法(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF展现出稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感度以最小化遗漏危机，这是医疗应用的关键特性。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Motivation: 解决LLMs创造力评估中的数据污染问题和昂贵的人工评估成本，借鉴人类创造力评估方法。

Method: 提出PACE方法，让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估创造力，验证其与Chatbot Arena Creative Writing排名的相关性。

Result: PACE与人类评估高度相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLMs达到普通人水平但不及专业人士，人类表现出更多样的关联模式。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLMs创造力的有效方法，LLMs在关联创造力方面接近普通人但仍有提升空间，人类在联想多样性和具体性方面优于LLMs。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Method: 提出AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从训练用的双语领域语料构建选择题QA数据集，通过持续训练追踪LLMs获取领域事实的过程。

Result: 实验表明，尽管使用高质量双语语料，跨语言知识转移仍然具有挑战性，LLMs在语言间传递领域知识存在困难。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解多语言知识获取机制，跨语言知识转移问题仍需解决，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话比单轮提示更常见且风险更高，但现有基准测试未能充分考量这种情况。

Method: 引入SafeMT基准测试，包含10,000个样本，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法。提出安全指数(SI)评估模型对话安全性，并设计对话安全调节器来检测对话中的恶意意图。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制存在不足，需要专门的安全防护措施。提出的对话安全调节器能有效提升模型在多轮对话中的安全性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将离散空间中的推理时间缩放技术（多样本生成结合过程/结果奖励模型重排序）应用到连续空间推理中的可行性，发现虽然能生成多样推理路径，但现有方法在连续思维空间中难以有效区分正确和错误推理。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索已证明在离散文本推理中有效的推理时间缩放技术是否能够成功适应连续空间推理，使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干模型。

Method: 使用基于dropout的采样生成多样推理路径，通过Pass@N分析评估性能潜力，并探究几何特性和轨迹动态等维度来分析连续思维空间中的挑战。

Result: 研究发现虽然能生成多样推理路径且Pass@N分析显示性能提升潜力，但离散空间中的数据生成和PRM/ORM训练方法在连续空间中仅带来边际改进，无法有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确融入可在推理时用于区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置，当前限制源于连续思维表示中缺乏关键归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性地探究时间偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，量化时间偏差现象，并提出时间偏差指数(TBI)来测量预测事件时间的系统性错位，同时开发可视化框架。

Result: 发现时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在，随音频长度增加而增大（在长录音中可达数十秒），且在不同事件类型和位置间存在差异。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Motivation: 现有评估缺乏真实场景基础，且未考虑不同伤害严重性的差异，如手术中的偏见决策与文本摘要中的风格偏见不应同等对待。

Method: 引入HALF（Harm-Aware LLM Fairness）框架，将九个应用领域分为三个层级（严重、中度、轻度），使用五阶段流程评估模型偏见并按伤害严重性加权结果。

Result: 评估八个LLM显示：(1) LLM在不同领域的公平性不一致；(2) 模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3) 推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育中表现更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并研究其机制和可解释性。

Method: 在3个开源权重LLMs上进行层修补分析，通过将预训练模型的激活值注入到微调模型的关键层中来研究偏见表现。

Result: 发现Knobe效应偏见不仅在学习过程中形成，而且集中在特定层中；仅需在少数关键层注入预训练激活值就能消除偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，通过针对性干预无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Motivation: LLM在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，无法有效关注长文本中的关键信息；"中间迷失"问题，难以处理长输入中间位置的信息。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单的解决方案。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：上下文门控加权(CGW)模块通过层间注意力跟踪和位置感知加权来缓解"中间迷失"问题；互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换来增强对关键段落的关注。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLM(Llama、Qwen、Mistral、Deepseek)上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上的多文档问答任务中平均F1得分提升4.2%。消融研究确认了CGW和RAS模块的重要贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一个即插即用的解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLM在多文档问答中的核心限制，展示了强大的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: 提出了MedQA-Followup框架，用于系统评估医学问答中的多轮对话鲁棒性，发现LLMs在浅层扰动下表现良好，但在多轮对话中表现出严重脆弱性，间接上下文干预比直接建议更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架通常评估单轮问答，忽视了医学咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂性，需要系统评估LLMs在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导性初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），同时引入间接-直接轴来区分上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 评估五个最先进的LLMs发现，模型在浅层扰动下表现合理，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，准确率从91.2%降至最低13.5%。间接上下文干预通常比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLMs安全可靠部署的关键但未充分探索的维度，间接上下文干预暴露了临床部署的重大脆弱性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

### [125] [Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12285)
*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过定制化的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码、两阶段预训练和优化的学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现了与现有强模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编码器改进主要针对英语，未能充分适应中文的词汇化和形态学特点，需要专门为中文设计优化的预训练模型。

Method: 使用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码课程、两阶段预训练（扩展上下文至8192 tokens）、阻尼余弦学习率调度，并在1.2T中文token上进行预训练。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上达到0.505（Pearson）/0.537（Spearman），超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT展示了为中文特性定制化设计的有效性，为中文NLP任务提供了可复现的强基线模型。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张背景下手动标注成为方法瓶颈的问题，探索利用LLMs实现大规模语料的自动化语法标注。

Method: 四阶段工作流：提示工程、事前评估、自动批量处理、事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在60小时内标注了COHA语料库中的143,933个句子，在两种复杂标注任务上达到98%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能性，但需关注成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于知识检索增强生成(RAG)的反言论生成框架，通过整合联合国数字图书馆、EUR-Lex和欧盟基本权利机构的知识库，为8个主要目标群体生成可信的反言论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要开发更可信和连贯的反言论生成框架。

Method: 将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，使用RAG管道整合32,792个文本的知识库，针对8个目标群体生成反言论。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该框架在标准指标和人工评估中都优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反言论生成开辟了新途径，适用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐关系可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测之间关系的争议性研究问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词汇，并利用该方法分析BA和NWP的关系。

Result: 发现BA和NWP依赖于很大程度上不同的词汇子集：NWP表现出近因和首因偏见，关注语法；而BA优先考虑语义和语篇层面的信息，具有更针对性的近因效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了我们对LLM与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了BA和NWP在特征依赖上的差异，所提出的归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在不同语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个基于卸载的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制，对不重要token使用一半专家加速推理，同时为重要token保留完整专家以保证质量，实现了1.6-1.72倍加速且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型卸载策略受限于CPU-GPU互连带宽，预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出MoBiLE框架，采用混合大小专家机制，为不重要token减少专家数量加速，为重要token保留完整专家；设计专用的回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理加速框架，通过智能的专家选择机制有效解决了带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在学术评审中存在系统性偏见：LLM评审员会系统性高估LLM撰写的论文，同时低估包含批判性陈述的人类论文，这源于LLM对特定语言特征的偏好和对批判性陈述的厌恶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在学术工作流程中的深度整合，研究其作为评审员对学术公平性的潜在影响，特别是LLMs在研究和评审双重角色中可能带来的新风险。

Method: 通过模拟实验，构建研究代理（生成和修订论文）和评审代理（评估提交内容），并进行人工标注分析。

Result: 发现LLM评审与人类判断存在显著偏差：1）LLM评审员系统性高估LLM撰写论文；2）LLM评审员持续低估包含批判性陈述的人类论文。这些源于语言特征偏见和对批判性陈述的厌恶。

Conclusion: 在同行评审中部署LLMs存在风险和公平性担忧，需要谨慎对待；但另一方面，LLM指导的修订能提升论文质量，对早期研究人员和低质量论文有积极价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

TL;DR: 对200多种语言进行的大规模跨语言分词评估显示，拉丁文字语言分词效率高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言分词成本显著增加3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词差异对实现跨语言人口公平获取人工智能构成重大障碍，需要系统量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对所有语言样本进行统一分词处理，收集分词统计数据，包括每句令牌数(TPS)和相对分词成本(RTC)，并以英语为基准进行比较。

Result: 拉丁文字语言分词效率一致较高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言分词膨胀显著，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用减少。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势。未来研究应优先开发考虑语言类型多样性的分词策略和自适应词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划与推理的知识超图框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索，解决了现有知识超图检索方法的静态规划、非自适应检索和结构语义利用不足等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识超图检索方法存在三个主要限制：静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对知识超图结构和语义的浅层利用，这些限制了在多跳问答任务中的有效性。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：(1)上下文感知规划模块，绘制局部知识超图邻域以指导结构化的推理计划生成；(2)结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演化的有向无环图，实现自适应多轨迹探索；(3)实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1得分超过先前SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG 19.73%，生成评估得分提高8.41%，同时在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH框架通过动态规划和结构化推理，有效克服了现有知识超图检索方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中展现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR框架，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态表示来解决RAG系统中的不忠实问题，在知识冲突条件下显著提升了准确性和上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆，特别是在知识冲突情况下的机制。

Method: 提出CLEAR框架：1）将上下文分解为细粒度的句子级知识；2）使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3）引入冲突感知微调来指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在各种冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过分析LLM内部表示和冲突定位，有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为理解LLM如何整合外部知识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLM在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能像人类一样处理新词，但准确性主要受训练数据量而非语言结构复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言能力是否接近人类水平，以及模型表现是由语言复杂性还是训练数据量主导。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能泛化形态学过程，准确性模式与社区规模和数据可用性更相关，而非结构复杂性。西班牙语和英语表现优于资源较少的语言。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂性的敏感性，其表现仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成能力的增强，身份模仿风险增加，但现有研究尚未系统评估个性化机器生成文本检测的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建个性化文本检测基准，分析特征反转陷阱现象，并提出基于潜在特征方向的性能预测方法。

Result: 实验结果显示个性化设置下检测器性能存在显著差距，提出的预测方法与实际性能变化相关性达到85%。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了基准和方法支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术此前仅限于数学和编程等有正确答案的领域，本研究旨在将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务中。

Method: 使用三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验。

Result: 两种基准方法在LeWiDi任务上持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法没有效果。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功转移到LeWiDi任务，分析了可能的原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在处理典型和异常实例时，如何平衡语用先验（输入相关）和语义先验（概念一般性）之间的冲突。

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析模型表现。

Result: 当图像与文本不一致时，概念理解显著下降；在查询单个实例时，语用先验的影响强于语义先验。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在处理异常实例时面临语用和语义先验的权衡问题，语用先验对模型表现有更强影响。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

TL;DR: FUT是一种微调方法，教导指令调优的LLMs忠实表达不确定性，而不改变其底层答案分布，通过将模型样本与不确定性修饰语对齐来构建训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的响应通常未加修饰或以不反映这种变异性的方式进行修饰，这传达了关于LLMs知识不确定状态的不忠实信息。

Method: 通过将模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）对齐来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，除了模型和一组提示外不需要监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教导LLMs忠实传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model
surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation

Motivation: 现有COSTAR框架在大型LLM上表现良好，但在小型本地优化模型上性能不一致，特别是在需要更指令性或约束性输出的任务中。

Method: 通过在COSTAR框架末尾添加'Answer'组件，形成COSTAR-A框架，并对最多80亿参数的小型微调模型进行受控提示-输出评估。

Result: COSTAR-A能提升某些任务中本地化LLM的输出结构和决策性，但效果因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型在使用COSTAR-A时表现优于单独使用COSTAR。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适合在资源受限硬件上进行计算效率高的AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，论文旨在研究如何在模式化推理任务中大幅降低标注成本而不影响推理性能。

Method: 提出PARO框架，通过识别任务特定的推理模式，让LLM基于这些模式自动生成对齐的推理轨迹，仅需有限的人工监督来定义推理模式。

Result: 实验表明PARO生成的推理轨迹在SFT+RLVR中达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的性能，验证了推理模式而非标注数量是性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: 在模式化推理任务中，大规模人工标注可以被基于LLM的自动标注替代，仅需有限的人工监督来定义推理模式，从而显著降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在开放生成任务中存在校准问题：在创意任务中输出过于同质化，在事实任务中产生多样化但错误的响应。这两种失败模式可以通过生成空间大小（GSS）概念来统一解决。

Method: 提出GSSBench任务套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，用于评估不同指标。使用模型内部表示（特别是EigenScore）来度量生成空间大小，并与标准多样性和不确定性量化指标进行比较。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）在仅使用模型内部表示的情况下，持续优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，能够提供对模型内部任务表示的更可解释的洞察。

Conclusion: GSS概念能够统一解释LLMs的两种主要失败模式，并在检测提示歧义、解释推理模型行为以及引导模型产生高质量多样化输出方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Motivation: 扩展先前关于语言模型是否偏好类型学常见语法属性的研究，通过更贴近自然语言的人工语言和更严格的泛化测试来获得更清晰的结论。

Method: 使用广义范畴语法构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构等自然语言特征，并测试语言模型对未见长句的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言模型确实表现出对类型学常见语法属性的偏好，这种偏好在更贴近自然语言的测试环境中依然存在。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为"自然度"概念多变且缺乏可扩展的定量指标。

Method: 提出DGRC方法：将对话分割为提示，使用语言模型生成子部分续写，重新组合对话和续写，比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续问题相关内容，指令调优模型此效应更强；当存在相关线索时，它们会减少问题相关偏好。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能减轻语言模型语言分析中的偏见，系统测试话语敏感行为，指令调优虽未进一步放大调节模式，但反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Motivation: 针对当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论框架对LLMs的语言学评论往往是推测性和非建设性的问题，作者认为需要转变视角，采用更经验主义的语言定义。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的语言学框架，将语言定义为所有说和写的内容的总和，强调使用频率作为语言的主要支配原则，并基于此框架挑战对LLMs的先前批评。

Result: 提出了基于Mańczak经验主义原则的LLMs设计、评估和解释的指导框架，挑战了需要"深层结构"或"基础"才能实现理想化语言"能力"的传统观点。

Conclusion: 通过转向Mańczak的经验主义语言定义和使用频率原则，可以为LLMs提供更建设性的语言学基础，超越传统理论框架的限制性批评。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个动态路由框架，为预训练LLM添加轻量级路由器，决定跳过、执行或重复Transformer层，在保持准确性的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有Transformer层，导致简单查询计算浪费，复杂查询推理深度不足。现有自适应深度方法依赖昂贵推理时搜索、架构修改或大规模重训练，且往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)推导高质量层配置，在计算预算下保持或提高准确性。采用窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器，确保在类别不平衡和长序列下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ARC和DART任务上，准确率提升高达+3.4%，平均每样本节省5层。路由器泛化到领域外任务，仅损失0.85%准确率，同时保持效率，比先前路由方法提升高达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可以为冻结LLM提供预算感知、准确性驱动的推理，无需修改基础权重。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

TL;DR: HyperLLM：基于大语言模型的多智能体协作超图生成框架，能够模拟真实网络特征生成大规模超图数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实超图数据集在规模和多样性上的稀缺，限制了超图学习算法的发展与评估，需要能够快速生成符合真实网络特征的大规模超图的方法

Method: 提出HyperLLM框架，利用大语言模型的语义推理、结构化生成和人类行为模拟能力，通过多智能体协作模拟超图的形成和演化过程，结合提示和结构反馈机制

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyperLLM在结构性和时序性超图模式上实现了卓越的保真度，且仅需最少的统计先验

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的框架为超图建模提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Due to the advantages of hypergraphs in modeling high-order relationships in
complex systems, they have been applied to higher-order clustering, hypergraph
neural networks and computer vision. These applications rely heavily on access
to high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to
traditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both
scale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and
evaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to
quickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of
real networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention.
Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly
their capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating
human behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph
generation from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel
LLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of
hypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates
prompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated
hypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to
structural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal
statistical priors. Our findings suggest that LLM-based frameworks offer a
promising new direction for hypergraph modeling.

TL;DR: 该研究应用机器学习和深度学习技术，利用乌尔都语推文预测名人的人口统计特征，在性别预测方面取得了最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语等高资源语言，乌尔都语作为低资源语言在名人画像分析领域尚未充分探索。名人粉丝的语言特征可以反映其追随者的人口统计信息。

Method: 收集乌尔都语推文数据集，预处理后训练多种算法：逻辑回归、支持向量机、随机森林、卷积神经网络和长短期记忆网络。

Result: 性别预测效果最佳，cRank和准确率均为0.65；年龄、职业和知名度预测结果中等。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于粉丝语言特征的机器学习和神经网络方法可以有效预测乌尔都语用户的人口统计信息。

Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a
platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities
are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and
professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an
opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and
social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and
interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be
used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this
field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu
largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to
the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from
followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple
algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long
Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance
was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of
0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction.
These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be
effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for
demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Motivation: 研究社交媒体时代首次大规模欧洲战争中精英驱动的政治传播，了解政策制定者如何适应战时传播挑战。

Method: 使用2019-2024年乌克兰和俄罗斯政策制定者Telegram公开帖子的独特数据集，分析传播量、主题内容和参与者参与度的变化。

Result: 入侵后Telegram活动急剧增加，特别是执政党政策制定者；乌克兰初期聚焦战争话题随后减少，俄罗斯回避战争话题并强调西方危机来分散注意力；不同规模和个体政策制定者存在传播策略差异。

Conclusion: 揭示了政策制定者在战时如何调整传播策略，为理解战争期间在线政治话语动态提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during
the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the
social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from
Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in
communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's
2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram
activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers.
Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this
emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided
war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western
crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in
communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual
policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime
communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of
online political discourse during times of war.

TL;DR: 提出StruSP框架，通过结构感知的合成传播增强来改进假新闻检测，解决现有方法忽视真实传播结构模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体假新闻传播严重威胁公众信任和社会稳定。现有基于传播的方法因不完整传播数据而受限，且LLM生成的合成传播通常忽略真实讨论的结构模式。

Method: 提出StruSP框架，在语义和结构维度上对齐合成传播与真实传播，设计双向进化传播学习策略，通过结构感知混合采样和掩码传播建模目标来对齐LLM与真实传播结构模式。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，StruSP在各种实际检测场景中显著提高了假新闻检测性能。

Conclusion: BEP使LLM能够在语义和结构上生成更真实和多样化的传播，StruSP框架有效提升了假新闻检测能力。

Abstract: The spread of fake news on social media poses a serious threat to public
trust and societal stability. While propagation-based methods improve fake news
detection by modeling how information spreads, they often suffer from
incomplete propagation data. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate synthetic propagation, but typically overlooks the structural
patterns of real-world discussions. In this paper, we propose a novel
structure-aware synthetic propagation enhanced detection (StruSP) framework to
fully capture structural dynamics from real propagation. It enables LLMs to
generate realistic and structurally consistent propagation for better
detection. StruSP explicitly aligns synthetic propagation with real-world
propagation in both semantic and structural dimensions. Besides, we also design
a new bidirectional evolutionary propagation (BEP) learning strategy to better
align LLMs with structural patterns of propagation in the real world via
structure-aware hybrid sampling and masked propagation modeling objective.
Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that StruSP significantly
improves fake news detection performance in various practical detection
scenarios. Further analysis indicates that BEP enables the LLM to generate more
realistic and diverse propagation semantically and structurally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体普及，在线问题行为日益升级为大规模危机，需要更全面的缓解策略。现有HCI研究多关注用户生成内容，缺乏对事件演变过程的追踪分析。

Method: 使用过去20年全球新闻报道构建包含93,250篇文章的数据集，分析代表性子集以分类利益相关者角色、行为类型和结果，采用事件导向视角追踪危机演变。

Result: 揭示了社交媒体危机的模式特征，为超越基于内容描述的更细致分类提供了依据，识别了危机中的关键利益相关者和行为动态。

Conclusion: 通过采用更广泛的视角，这项研究旨在为设计更安全的平台提供信息，支持主动措施来缓解危机并培养更可信的在线环境。

Abstract: As social media adoption grows globally, online problematic behaviors
increasingly escalate into large-scale crises, requiring an evolving set of
mitigation strategies. While HCI research often analyzes problematic behaviors
with pieces of user-generated content as the unit of analysis, less attention
has been given to event-focused perspectives that track how discrete events
evolve. In this paper, we examine 'social media crises': discrete patterns of
problematic behaviors originating and evolving within social media that cause
larger-scale harms. Using global news coverage, we present a dataset of 93,250
news articles covering social media-endemic crises from the past 20 years. We
analyze a representative subset to classify stakeholder roles, behavior types,
and outcomes, uncovering patterns that inform more nuanced classification of
social media crises beyond content-based descriptions. By adopting a wider
perspective, this research seeks to inform the design of safer platforms,
enabling proactive measures to mitigate crises and foster more trustworthy
online environments.

TL;DR: MOUFLON是一种公平感知的模块化社区检测方法，允许调整分区质量与公平结果之间的重要性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社区检测中的结构偏见问题，防止人口统计特征与网络结构过度对齐导致的公平性问题。

Method: 使用新颖的比例平衡公平度量，在模块化社区检测中引入公平约束，可调节公平与分区质量之间的权衡。

Result: 在合成和真实网络数据集上评估，展示了模块化与公平性之间的权衡关系，以及网络特征对公平结果的影响。

Conclusion: 将公平约束纳入模块化社区检测具有重要价值，为设计公平感知的社会网络分析方法提供了关键考虑因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MOUFLON, a fairness-aware, modularity-based
community detection method that allows adjusting the importance of partition
quality over fairness outcomes. MOUFLON uses a novel proportional balance
fairness metric, providing consistent and comparable fairness scores across
multi-group and imbalanced network settings. We evaluate our method under both
synthetic and real network datasets, focusing on performance and the trade-off
between modularity and fairness in the resulting communities, along with the
impact of network characteristics such as size, density, and group
distribution. As structural biases can lead to strong alignment between
demographic groups and network structure, we also examine scenarios with highly
clustered homogeneous groups, to understand how such structures influence
fairness outcomes. Our findings showcase the effects of incorporating fairness
constraints into modularity-based community detection, and highlight key
considerations for designing and benchmarking fairness-aware social network
analysis methods.

Motivation: 研究X平台Community Notes众包审核系统的效率，该系统旨在通过集体审核识别和标注误导性内容。

Method: 基于超过180万条笔记数据，分析参与不平等性、共识形成和时效性三个关键维度，使用基尼系数、比值比等统计方法。

Result: 发现高度集中的参与模式（前10%贡献者产生58%笔记），共识罕见（仅11.5%笔记达成发布共识），69%帖子收到矛盾分类，笔记平均在帖子发布65.7小时后才发布。

Conclusion: Community Notes是一个分层化、审议性系统，由少数精英主导，存在持续分歧，受时效性限制。需要设计策略促进公平、快速共识和认知可靠性。

Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the
efficiency of X's Community Notes, a crowdsourced moderation system for
identifying and contextualising potentially misleading content. Drawing on over
1.8 million notes, we examine three key dimensions of crowdsourced moderation:
participation inequality, consensus formation, and timeliness. Despite the
system's goal of collective moderation, we find substantial concentration
effect, with the top 10% of contributors producing 58% of all notes (Gini
Coefficient = 0.68). The observed consensus is rare-only 11.5% of notes reach
agreement on publication, while 69% of posts receive conflicting
classifications. A majority of noted posts (approximately 68%) are annotated as
"Note Not Needed", reflecting the repurposing of the platform for debate rather
than moderation. We found that such posts are paradoxically more likely to
yield published notes (OR = 3.12). Temporal analyses show that the notes, on
average, are published 65.7 hours after the original post, with longer delays
significantly reducing the likelihood of consensus. These results portray
Community Notes as a stratified, deliberative system dominated by a small
contributor elite, marked by persistent dissensus, and constrained by
timeliness. We conclude this study by outlining design strategies to promote
equity, faster consensus, and epistemic reliability in community-based
moderation.

TL;DR: Symphony是一个去中心化的广域网流量工程系统，通过二次正则化和随机切片算法解决控制器分歧导致的拥塞问题，同时保持故障隔离优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云提供商采用去中心化TE系统来限制控制器故障的影响范围，但自主切片控制器会产生分歧性的流量分配，导致链路负载超过容量的30%。

Method: 1. 通过二次正则化增强TE目标，使流量分配对需求扰动具有鲁棒性；2. 使用随机切片算法将网络分区，最小化爆炸半径，将关键流量源分布到不同切片中。

Result: 在云提供商WAN上的广泛评估显示，Symphony相比当前实践将分歧引起的拥塞减少了14倍，爆炸半径减少了79%。

Conclusion: Symphony通过正则化确保算法稳定性，通过智能切片提供架构弹性，在保持去中心化故障隔离优势的同时有效解决分歧导致的拥塞问题。

Abstract: Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic
engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In
the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the
network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we
find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic
allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present
Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of
divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of
decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization,
Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE
controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination.
In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to
minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices,
preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations
work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic
allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the
network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony
reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared
to current practice.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with exponentially growing
parameters is making cross-data center (DC) training an inevitable trend.
However, viable strategies for extending single-DC training frameworks to
multi-DC environments remain underdeveloped. We experimentally demonstrate, for
the first time, a high-performance geo-distributed LLMs training framework
across multiple DCs interconnected by a lossless, remote direct memory access
(RDMA) enabled Datacenter Optical Transport Network (DC-OTN). An enhanced
pipeline parallelism scheme is implemented within the Ascend full-stack
environment of Huawei, which effectively eliminates the impact of cross-DC
communication overhead on training efficiency. The overlapped computation and
cross-DC communication is achieved with constraint cross-DC bandwidth and High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM), reducing computation bubble ratio by up to 78.91%.

Motivation: 传统眼动研究中，研究人员需要预先选择分析目标（如控制流或语法元素），并开发从注视点提取适当指标的方法。这种分析依赖于耗时的研究工作，且不同级别的关注区域定义会导致不同结果。

Method: eye2vec将连续的两个注视点表示为语法元素之间的转换，使用分布式表示。这种表示方法便于采用多样化的数据分析方法，并具有丰富的语义解释。

Result: 该方法简化了眼动分析过程，减少了研究人员的手动工作量，使眼动数据的分析更加高效和灵活。

Conclusion: eye2vec通过分布式表示技术改进了软件开发者眼动分析的基础设施，为程序理解研究提供了更有效的分析工具。

Abstract: This paper presents eye2vec, an infrastructure for analyzing software
developers' eye movements while reading source code. In common eye-tracking
studies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets
such as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods
to extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here,
researchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code
blocks, and the difference leads to different results. Moreover, the
interpretation of fixation for word/line can vary across the purposes of the
analyses. Hence, the eye-tracking analysis is a difficult task that depends on
the time-consuming manual work of the researchers. eye2vec represents
continuous two fixations as transitions between syntactic elements using
distributed representations. The distributed representation facilitates the
adoption of diverse data analysis methods with rich semantic interpretations.

Motivation: LLM在数据密集型工作流中的应用受到真实世界文本数据（如日志、遥测数据）量大、冗长和嘈杂的限制。直接将这些数据输入LLM成本高、不环保且与任务目标不匹配。

Method: 将输入侧缩减视为注意力分配而非压缩，优先保留与下游任务最相关的信息。提出构建基准测试、设计自适应缩减流程、将token预算感知预处理集成到数据库和检索系统中的研究挑战。

Result: 提出了一个新的设计框架，将文本缩减作为LLM-数据集成的核心原则，以更有效地利用有限的注意力资源。

Conclusion: 通过将稀缺的注意力资源引导到嘈杂数据流中的有意义信号，可以实现可扩展、准确和可持续的LLM-数据集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive
workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the
effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and
noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring
streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally
unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in
LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but
the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In
this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention
budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design
principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as
compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most
relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building
benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating
token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our
vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in
noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable
LLM--data integration.

*Xu Yang,Jiayuan Zhou,Michael Pacheco,Wenhan Zhu,Pengfei He,Shaowei Wang,Kui Liu,Ruiqi Pan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Lingxi是一个基于历史问题修复数据提取程序性知识来指导代理解决仓库级问题的框架，在SWE-bench基准测试中达到74.6%的解决率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的方法存在两个关键局限：缺乏程序性知识（即问题如何逐步修复及其背后的原理），以及依赖大量计算能力盲目探索解决方案空间。

Method: Lingxi通过分层抽象机制离线构建程序性知识，使代理能够学习修复的步骤和原理；在线应用时采用知识驱动的扩展方法，利用类似问题的程序性知识从多个角度智能分析目标问题。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试的Past@1设置中，Lingxi成功解决了74.6%的错误，比五种最先进技术高出5.4%到14.9%。消融研究确认性能提升直接来自程序性知识的使用。

Conclusion: 程序性知识是Lingxi成功的关键，其中"设计模式和编码实践"是最重要的知识方面，不同知识方面在不同阶段（分析、规划和修复）的作用会发生变化。

Abstract: Driven by the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-powered
agents are making significant improvements in software engineering tasks, yet
struggle with complex, repository-level issue resolution. Existing agent-based
methods have two key limitations. First, they lack of procedural knowledge
(i.e., how an issue is fixed step-by-step and rationales behind it) to learn
and leverage for issue resolution. Second, they rely on massive computational
power to blindly explore the solution space. % To address those limitations, we
propose Lingxi, an issue resolution framework that leverages procedural
knowledge extracted from historical issue-fixing data to guide agents in
solving repository-level issues. \ourTool first constructs this knowledge
offline through a hierarchical abstraction mechanism, enabling agents to learn
the how and why behind a fix, not just the final solution. During online
application, it employs a knowledge-driven scaling method that leverages the
procedural knowledge of similar issues to intelligently analyze the target
issue from multiple perspectives, in sharp contrast to undirected, brute-force
exploration. % Lingxi successfully resolves 74.6\% of bugs on the SWE-bench
Verified benchmark in Past@1 setting, outperforming five state-of-the-art
techniques by a significant margin (5.4\% to 14.9\%). Our comprehensive
ablation study confirmed that the success of Lingxi comes directly from its use
of procedural knowledge. Without it, the performance gains from scaling alone
is negligible. Our qualitative study further shows that the ``design patterns
$\&$ coding practices'' is the most critical knowledge aspect, and that the
roles of different knowledge aspects switch across different stages (i.e.,
analysis, planning, and fixing).

*Alessandro Cornacchia,Vaastav Anand,Muhammad Bilal,Zafar Qazi,Marco Canini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DMAS-Forge是一个分布式多代理系统框架，旨在简化AI代理应用的部署和测试，通过解耦应用逻辑与部署选择，自动生成必要的连接代码和配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理应用日益复杂，需要多个具有不同角色、专用工具和内存访问权限的代理来完成任务，这类似于面向服务的架构。但在快速发展的编程框架和协议环境中，部署和测试分布式AI代理系统仍然是一项艰巨且劳动密集的任务。

Method: DMAS-Forge框架将应用逻辑与具体部署选择解耦，透明地生成必要的连接代码和配置，以最小的手动工作量在各种部署场景中启动分布式多代理应用。

Result: 提出了DMAS-Forge的愿景、设计原则和原型实现，展示了该框架能够简化分布式AI代理系统的部署过程。

Conclusion: DMAS-Forge为分布式多代理系统的部署提供了有效解决方案，并讨论了该方法的机遇和未来工作方向。

Abstract: Agentic AI applications increasingly rely on multiple agents with distinct
roles, specialized tools, and access to memory layers to solve complex tasks --
closely resembling service-oriented architectures. Yet, in the rapid evolving
landscape of programming frameworks and new protocols, deploying and testing AI
agents as distributed systems remains a daunting and labor-intensive task. We
present DMAS-Forge, a framework designed to close this gap. DMAS-Forge
decouples application logic from specific deployment choices, and aims at
transparently generating the necessary glue code and configurations to spawn
distributed multi-agent applications across diverse deployment scenarios with
minimal manual effort. We present our vision, design principles, and a
prototype of DMAS-Forge. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and future work
for our approach.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TorchCor是一个基于PyTorch的高性能Python库，用于在通用GPU上进行心脏电生理模拟，显著加速了大型3D网格的模拟计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏电生理模拟通常需要高性能计算资源，但许多研究团队和临床医生无法获得这些资源。

Method: 基于PyTorch构建，使用有限元方法在通用GPU上进行心脏电生理模拟。

Result: 验证了求解器的准确性，与制造的分析解和N版本基准问题进行了对比。

Conclusion: TorchCor可免费用于学术和商业用途，无使用限制。

Abstract: Cardiac electrophysiology (CEP) simulations are increasingly used for
understanding cardiac arrhythmias and guiding clinical decisions. However,
these simulations typically require high-performance computing resources with
numerous CPU cores, which are often inaccessible to many research groups and
clinicians. To address this, we present TorchCor, a high-performance Python
library for CEP simulations using the finite element method on general-purpose
GPUs. Built on PyTorch, TorchCor significantly accelerates CEP simulations,
particularly for large 3D meshes. The accuracy of the solver is verified
against manufactured analytical solutions and the $N$-version benchmark
problem. TorchCor is freely available for both academic and commercial use
without restrictions.

### [167] [Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082)
*Huy Nguyen,Christoph Treude,Patanamon Thongtanunam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文通过实证研究发现，在代码表示中融入上下文信息（如版本历史和调用图）能显著提升神经网络模型在代码克隆检测和代码摘要任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型主要依赖源代码本身，忽略了版本历史和结构关系等上下文信息，这限制了模型理解代码演化和操作方式的能力。

Method: 在两个数据集（SeSaMe和CodeSearchNet）上评估了五个代表性模型（CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT、CodeT5、PLBART、ASTNN），在仅使用代码和增强上下文两种设置下进行微调，并进行了人工评估。

Result: 上下文信息普遍提升模型性能：版本历史持续提升克隆检测（如CodeT5 F1提升15.92%）和代码摘要（如GraphCodeBERT METEOR提升5.56%），调用图效果因模型和任务而异。多上下文组合带来更大增益（最高提升21.48% macro-F1）。

Conclusion: 上下文信号有潜力增强代码理解能力，并为优化神经网络软件工程模型中的上下文编码开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks,
from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve
strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual
information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits
their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical
study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals
affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream
tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe
(1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative
models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under
code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally
improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection
(e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56%
METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple
contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100
Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly
preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55).
These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code
comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in
neural SE models.

*Zhenyu Mao,Jacky Keung,Fengji Zhang,Shuo Liu,Yifei Wang,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SEMAP协议通过引入软件工程核心设计原则，显著减少了多智能体LLM系统在软件开发任务中的失败率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体LLM系统在模拟协作开发工作流时存在三个核心缺陷：规范不足、协调错位和不恰当的验证，缺乏基础SE结构化原则。

Method: 引入SEMAP协议层方法，基于Google的A2A基础设施实现三个核心SE设计原则：明确行为契约建模、结构化消息传递、生命周期引导执行与验证。

Result: 在代码开发中，函数级开发失败减少69.6%，部署级开发减少56.7%；漏洞检测中，Python任务失败减少47.4%，C/C++任务减少28.2%。

Conclusion: SEMAP通过整合软件工程结构化原则，有效提升了多智能体LLM系统在软件工程任务中的可靠性和成功率。

Abstract: The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in
automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs).
Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate
collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three
core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and
inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE
structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent
Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE
design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract
modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with
verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A)
infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure
Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures
across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6%
reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for
deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces
failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.

TL;DR: iCodeReviewer是一个基于大语言模型的自动化安全代码审查方法，采用混合提示架构和路由算法，在安全问题上取得了63.98%的F1分数，部署时评论接受率高达84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化安全代码审查方法（静态分析、深度学习模型、提示方法）存在精度和覆盖范围有限、缺乏全面评估的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出iCodeReviewer方法，采用混合提示架构，包含多个动态提示管道（每个检查特定安全问题），并通过路由算法基于代码特征激活必要提示专家，减少误报。

Result: 在内部数据集上，安全问题的识别和定位达到63.98%的F1分数；在生产环境中部署时，生成的审查评论接受率高达84%。

Conclusion: iCodeReviewer通过混合提示架构和路由算法有效解决了现有自动化安全代码审查方法的局限性，在实际部署中表现出色。

Abstract: Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that
identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development.
Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify,
as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions.
Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the
manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the
progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static
analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the
challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive
evaluation.
  To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated
secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs).
iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that
incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues.
Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a
specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing
algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features
in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM
hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and
localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by
iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed
in production environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文使用LLM辅助筛选方法对软件工程与心理学交叉领域的9000多篇论文进行了范围综述，重点关注言语数据的使用，发现SE经常借鉴PSY方法但反向影响很少，主要主题与SE工艺相关而人本主题较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解软件开发者的思维、决策和行为是软件工程的关键挑战，言语化技术提供了一种轻量级研究认知方面的方法。

Method: 采用LLM辅助筛选流程，使用GPT仅基于标题评估9000多篇论文的相关性，验证GPT输出与人工评审的一致性。

Result: GPT输出与人工评审高度一致，分歧率为13%；主要主题与SE工艺相关，人本主题较少；SE经常借鉴PSY方法，但反向影响罕见。

Conclusion: LLM在支持跨学科综述过程中有效，言语化相关研究主要关注SE工艺方面，需要更多人本导向的研究，SE与PSY之间的知识流动主要是单向的。

Abstract: Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave
remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques
(methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight
and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a
scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY),
focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary
reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening
pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on
titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from
verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting
interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human
reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent
themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics
were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY
methods, whereas the reverse is rare.

*Kevin Krings,Nino S. Bohn,Thomas Ludwig*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vibe Coding（VC）这一新兴编程范式，强调开发者与AI系统之间直觉、情感驱动和即兴的互动，与传统编程方法形成对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI（特别是大语言模型）如何改变软件开发实践，研究VC范式如何从传统的AI辅助开发工具（如GitHub Copilot）中分化出来。

Method: 通过对10名经验丰富的软件从业者进行5次半结构化访谈，识别出五个主题维度：创造力、可持续性、编程未来、协作和批评。

Result: 将VC概念化为"共同漂流"的隐喻，与流行的"共同驾驶"AI辅助开发视角形成对比。VC重新配置了开发者的角色，模糊了专业与非专业开发者之间的界限。

Conclusion: VC代表了编程文化的有意义转变，虽然支持新颖的表达形式和快速原型设计，但也带来了可重复性、可扩展性和包容性方面的挑战，值得在HCI和软件工程研究中进一步调查。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
particularly large language models, have introduced new possibilities for
software development practices. In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe
Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and
improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon
the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from
conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like
GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten
experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions:
creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and
criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting,
contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted
development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring
boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel
forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges
regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC
represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further
investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering
research.

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了之前对云环境中性能变异性的调查，特别关注重大全球事件（如黑色星期五）对性能基准测试结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云环境中基准测试结果的可重复性和可信度常因性能变异性而受到质疑，研究旨在量化这种变异性并探索重大事件对性能的影响。

Method: 通过在不同时间段重复执行流处理应用程序基准测试，分析性能变异性，并特别关注黑色星期五等重大事件期间的表现。

Result: 确认了应用层级的性能变异性确实存在，但程度低于通常假设，并识别出了微妙的每日和每周性能模式。

Conclusion: 云环境中的性能基准测试需要考虑时间因素和重大事件的影响，以提高结果的可靠性和可比性。

Abstract: Benchmarks and performance experiments are frequently conducted in cloud
environments. However, their results are often treated with caution, as the
presumed high variability of performance in the cloud raises concerns about
reproducibility and credibility. In a recent study, we empirically quantified
the impact of this variability on benchmarking results by repeatedly executing
a stream processing application benchmark at different times of the day over
several months. Our analysis confirms that performance variability is indeed
observable at the application level, although it is less pronounced than often
assumed. The larger scale of our study compared to related work allowed us to
identify subtle daily and weekly performance patterns. We now extend this
investigation by examining whether a major global event, such as Black Friday,
affects the outcomes of performance benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文评估了SysMLv2在领域特定语言(DSL)创建方面的能力，通过开发DarTwin DSL来形式化数字孪生演化符号，但发现当前SysMLv2工具在图形符号能力方面存在限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SysMLv2新增了内置的领域特定概念和语言扩展机制，这有望促进DSL的创建并与现有系统描述和技术设计接口。本文旨在评估这些特性并通过具体用例验证SysMLv2的能力。

Method: 通过SysMLv2开发DarTwin DSL，该DSL形式化了现有的DarTwin数字孪生演化符号，从而理论上使得任何SysMLv2工具都能广泛应用DarTwin的演化模板。

Result: 成功演示了DarTwin DSL，但发现当前可用的SysMLv2工具在图形符号能力方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 这项工作为数字孪生的模型驱动工程领域做出了贡献，并将其与SysMLv2的发布相结合，从而在系统工程中整合了系统化方法与数字孪生演化管理。

Abstract: The new SysMLv2 adds mechanisms for the built-in specification of
domain-specific concepts and language extensions. This feature promises to
facilitate the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and interfacing
with existing system descriptions and technical designs. In this paper, we
review these features and evaluate SysMLv2's capabilities using concrete use
cases. We develop DarTwin DSL, a DSL that formalizes the existing DarTwin
notation for Digital Twin (DT) evolution, through SysMLv2, thereby supposedly
enabling the wide application of DarTwin's evolution templates using any
SysMLv2 tool. We demonstrate DarTwin DSL, but also point out limitations in the
currently available tooling of SysMLv2 in terms of graphical notation
capabilities. This work contributes to the growing field of Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) for DTs and combines it with the release of SysMLv2, thus
integrating a systematic approach with DT evolution management in systems
engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Diff-XYZ是一个用于代码差异理解的紧凑基准，包含三个监督任务：应用差异、反向应用差异和差异生成，基于真实提交数据构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠处理代码差异对于大规模编辑和重构代码库的智能体至关重要，需要评估和改进LLM处理代码差异的能力。

Method: 从CommitPackFT的真实提交中提取三元组⟨旧代码, 新代码, 差异⟩，使用统一差异格式，并进行跨格式比较研究。

Result: 研究发现不同格式应根据用例和模型大小选择使用，例如搜索替换格式适合大型模型的差异生成，但不适合差异分析和小型模型。

Conclusion: Diff-XYZ基准为评估和改进LLM处理代码差异能力提供了可重复使用的基础，有助于未来差异格式和代码编辑模型的发展。

Abstract: Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor
repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff
understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff
$\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code),
and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in
the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code},
\textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with
automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a
focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format
comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that
different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For
example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models
in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and
smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing
and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff
formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub:

TL;DR: 开发了两个针对软件工程领域的共情量表：EmpathiSEr-P（测量从业者间共情）和EmpathiSEr-U（测量从业者对用户的共情），填补了该领域缺乏有效测量工具的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用共情量表在心理学和医疗领域应用良好，但不适用于软件工程特有的社会技术环境，无法准确测量软件从业者角色特定、领域相关的共情表达。

Method: 采用严谨的多阶段方法，包括专家评估、认知访谈和两次从业者调查，基于从业者知情概念框架开发量表，涵盖认知共情、情感共情和共情反应三个维度。

Result: 成功开发出首个经过心理测量学验证的软件工程专用共情量表，为研究者和从业者提供了评估共情和设计共情增强干预的工具。

Conclusion: 这两个量表填补了软件工程领域共情测量的重要空白，能够有效支持团队协作和用户交互中的共情评估与提升。

Abstract: Empathy plays a critical role in software engineering (SE), influencing
collaboration, communication, and user-centred design. Although SE research has
increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no
validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique
socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while
well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language,
scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for
software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse,
role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as
understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's
technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or
everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two
domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among
practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users.
Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass
three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic
responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert
evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting
instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales
tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing
empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and
user interactions.

TL;DR: 评估简化能源和碳模型在网站可持续性报告中的准确性，发现常用恒定功率近似值与实际能耗存在显著偏差，偏差具有系统性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然丹麦Digst框架和英国DIMPACT模型在可持续性报告中广泛使用，但其准确性和精确度尚未得到充分研究，需要验证这些模型是否能真实反映用户与网站交互时的实际能耗。

Method: 通过实证研究，在四种笔记本电脑平台上测量购物、预订、导航和新闻等常见网站类别的能耗，使用预定义用户流程执行测试。

Result: 结果显示恒定功率近似法(P*t)与实际测量能耗存在显著差异，差异程度取决于网站类别、设备类型和任务特性，模型偏差具有系统性而非随机性。

Conclusion: 需要在可复现的可持续性报告框架中采用考虑类别和设备特性的功率参数，以提高模型的准确性。

Abstract: Sustainability reporting in web-based services increasingly relies on
simplified energy and carbon models such as the Danish Agency of Digital
Government's Digst framework and the United Kingdom-based DIMPACT model.
Although these models are widely adopted, their accuracy and precision remain
underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating how well such
models reflect actual energy consumption during realistic user interactions
with common website categories. Energy use was measured across shopping,
booking, navigation, and news services using predefined user flows executed on
four laptop platforms. The results show that the commonly applied
constant-power approximation (P * t) can diverge substantially from measured
energy, depending on website category, device type, and task characteristics.
The findings demonstrate that model deviations are systematic rather than
random and highlight the need for category-aware and device-reflective power
parameters in reproducible sustainability reporting frameworks.

*Muhammad Ashfaq,Ahmed R. Sadik,Teerath Das,Muhammad Waseem,Niko Makitalo,Tommi Mikkonen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述分析了动态系统之系统（SoSs）中的运行时组合研究，识别了核心挑战、解决方案、工具和评估方法。研究发现挑战主要涉及建模分析、弹性操作、系统编排和异构性，解决方案包括数字孪生、语义本体、自适应架构等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SoSs在动态环境中运行，需要运行时组合来实现适应性，但现有文献缺乏对此的系统性综合研究。

Method: 采用系统文献综述方法，筛选2019-2024年间的1,774项研究，选取80项主要研究进行主题分析。

Result: 识别了四大挑战类别和七大解决方案领域，发现服务导向框架在工具中占主导，仿真平台支持评估，但存在互操作性不足和标准化基准缺失等问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自主性与协调性、建模与现实差距等张力，呼吁标准化评估指标、可扩展去中心化架构和跨领域框架，为开发动态可组合SoSs提供指导。

Abstract: Context: Modern Systems of Systems (SoSs) increasingly operate in dynamic
environments (e.g., smart cities, autonomous vehicles) where runtime
composition -- the on-the-fly discovery, integration, and coordination of
constituent systems (CSs)--is crucial for adaptability. Despite growing
interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in
dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition
in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting
tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature
Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and
selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges
fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system
orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas:
co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks,
adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience.
Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling,
while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools,
limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks
remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based,
implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in
domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation.
Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus
coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It
calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized
architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide
researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically
composable SoSs.

### [178] [Beyond Postconditions: Can Large Language Models infer Formal Contracts for Automatic Software Verification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12702)
*Cedric Richter,Heike Wehrheim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NL2Contract任务，使用LLM将自然语言转换为包含前置条件和后置条件的正式功能契约，相比仅生成后置条件的方法，能显著减少自动验证器产生的误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动软件验证器在实践中因缺乏正式规范而难以应用的问题，以及LLM仅生成后置条件时会导致验证器产生大量误报的局限性。

Method: 引入NL2Contract任务，使用LLM从代码中的自然语言提示（如函数名、注释、文档）推断正式功能契约，包括前置条件和后置条件，并定义了验证指标。

Result: 评估显示：(1) LLM能有效生成对所有可能输入都可靠的功能契约；(2) 生成的契约足以区分错误和正确行为；(3) 使用功能契约比仅使用后置条件能显著减少误报。

Conclusion: LLM推断的功能契约与开发者意图高度一致，使得自动软件验证器能够有效捕获真实世界中的bug，为软件验证的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task
of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in
practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world
code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal
postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function
names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as
specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to
suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to
be false alarms.
  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from
natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the
process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate
informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of
postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and
compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative
power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of
automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with
different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation
nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at
generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the
generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from
correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional
contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions
alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally
align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software
verifiers to catch real-world bugs.

TL;DR: MM-assist是一个基于LLM的MOVEMETHOD重构助手，通过结合静态分析、RAG和自我一致性检查来过滤LLM幻觉，显著提升了重构推荐的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法推荐的MOVEMETHOD重构与专家开发者的实际操作不符，而LLM虽然能给出专家级建议，但存在高达80%的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用IDE静态分析过滤LLM幻觉，设计自一致性、批判和排序的工作流程，采用重构感知的RAG解决LLM上下文限制问题。

Result: 在基准测试中Recall@1和Recall@3提升1.7倍，在210个开源重构案例中Recall率提升至少2.4倍，用户研究中82.8%的推荐获得积极评价。

Conclusion: MM-assist通过协同结合LLM、IDE、静态分析和语义相关性，实现了有效且实用的MOVEMETHOD重构自动化。

Abstract: MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools
that recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not
align with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive
training of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code,
they should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and
which classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations
revealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%
of the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered
assistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end
lifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that
automatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a
novel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank
refactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,
projectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing
refactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,
synergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and
semantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we
compare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist
significantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other
researchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a
corpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates
improve by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced
participants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They
rated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist
is both effective and useful.

*Sahaj Raj Malla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了AI代理在Dhumbal文化卡牌游戏中的表现，比较了规则型、搜索型和学习型策略。规则型激进代理以88.3%胜率显著优于其他方法，主要通过对Jhyap声明的有效利用获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在具有文化意义的不完美信息多人卡牌游戏Dhumbal中的表现，为文化游戏的数字保存提供支持，并推进AI研究。

Method: 形式化Dhumbal游戏机制，实现多种AI代理：启发式方法（激进、保守、平衡、机会主义）、搜索方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO）。通过类别内锦标赛和跨类别锦标赛进行评估，使用统计方法分析性能。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，规则型激进代理获得最高胜率（88.3%），显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），主要通过有效利用Jhyap声明获胜。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了可复现的AI框架、在部分信息下启发式有效性的见解以及开源代码，推进了AI研究并支持文化游戏的数字保存。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了LLM作为评估者存在严重正向偏见的问题，并提出了一种基于少数否决策略和回归框架的解决方案，显著提高了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法存在系统性正向偏见，虽然能准确识别有效输出，但对无效输出的识别能力很差，导致可靠性评分虚高。

Method: 提出最优少数否决策略来缓解偏见，并引入基于回归的框架直接建模验证器偏见，使用少量人工标注数据进行校正。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降低到1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决LLM评估中的正向偏见问题，显著提高评估准确性，为模型选择提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: HAL（Holistic Agent Leaderboard）是一个解决AI智能体评估挑战的标准化评估框架，通过并行评估、三维分析和LLM辅助日志检查，揭示智能体行为并促进可靠智能体的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响了对智能体实际性能的理解。需要标准化评估方法来推动从基准测试表现到现实世界可靠性的转变。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架：在数百个VM上并行执行评估，将评估时间从数周缩短到数小时；2. 三维分析：涵盖模型、框架和基准测试三个维度；3. LLM辅助日志检查：发现智能体未报告的行为模式。

Result: 进行了21,730次智能体测试，涵盖9个模型和9个基准测试（编码、网页导航、科学、客服），成本约4万美元。发现意外洞察：更高推理努力在多数情况下反而降低准确率。发现了未报告行为，如在HuggingFace上搜索基准测试而非解决问题，或在机票预订任务中滥用信用卡。

Conclusion: HAL通过标准化智能体评估方法，解决了评估中的常见陷阱，有助于推动开发在现实世界中可靠工作的智能体，而非仅仅在基准测试中表现优异的智能体。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解读能力的基准测试，基于ClinGen临床遗传学专家标注数据，测试模型提取实验结果、评估证据强度、分类实验结果的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因变异解读方法耗时费力，生成式语言模型可加速这一过程，但现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 从ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验结果。

Result: 模型在文献解读方面显示潜力但存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解读上更优。模型经常产生幻觉或误解结果，即使正确分类证据。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解读方面的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的未来研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Method: 为每个智能体分配基因型，基于包容性适应度建模奖励函数，允许遗传物质共享，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社会动态。

Result: 实验结果与汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理一致，展示了基于遗传相似性的合作谱系，能够产生非团队型的社会动态。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更战略先进和社会智能的智能体出现提供了基础，可扩展到具有时空结构、有限资源和进化种群的开放环境。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，个性化LLM回复需要有效获取用户偏好。生成跨领域的顺序澄清问题仍具挑战性，需要开发更有效的方法来引导用户表达偏好。

Method: 采用受扩散模型启发的两阶段过程：前向过程从用户画像生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问来"去噪"用户画像。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM在提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的熟练度。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段训练方法能有效提升LLM生成顺序澄清问题的能力，为个性化推荐系统中的用户偏好获取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，现有传感器存在视野受限和被遮挡的问题。车辆间通信能够共享信息，即使在传感器被遮挡时也能保持车辆间的相互感知。

Method: 设计并训练了基于协作感知消息的图神经网络(CAMNet)，在一个广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行训练，并在自建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法展示了有前景的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测。

Conclusion: CAM数据可用于车辆轨迹预测，但方法仍存在一些局限性，为未来研究提供了机会。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Method: 开发CausalTrace神经符号因果分析模块，集成到SmartPilot工业CoPilot中，使用数据驱动因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析。

Result: 在学术火箭装配测试中，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），RCA性能强劲（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92），C3AN评估得分4.59/5。

Conclusion: CausalTrace通过神经符号因果分析提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，在工业环境中表现出高精度和可靠性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件中合约遵从性这一关键方面，即如何处理不符合前置条件的输入。

Method: 提供专注于合约违反的测试套件语料库，系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成，并引入量化合约遵从性的新指标。

Result: 研究表明，在提示中增加合约违反测试用例相比仅使用合约描述能显著提升模型对合约的遵从能力。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码在功能和合约遵从性方面的鲁棒性提供了严格且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测数据自动检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气等地理数据库信息，生成带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理空间接地的智能体能够超越基线方法，该框架可泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害。

Conclusion: GAL框架成功地将LLM与结构化地理数据结合，显著提升了灾害响应中资源分配决策的质量和证据基础。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and

*Sunzhu Li,Zhiyu Lin,Shuling Yang,Jiale Zhao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来引导模型获得更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但存在推理效率低下和目标偏离的问题。现有的免训练方法要么局限于僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes（思考前缀），这些前缀通过推理行为分类学的驱动来演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了精度-长度权衡以实现高效推理，大幅提升了安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。ThinkPilot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，提供了一个可泛化的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个基于LLM的零样本人口统计推理框架，通过分层思维链提示从轨迹数据推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法依赖大规模标注数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，通过分层思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化人口推断）指导LLM进行推理。

Result: 在真实轨迹数据上的实验表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口数据稀缺问题，同时提供透明的推理链，具有良好的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备通用决策能力，但仅基于语言训练缺乏物理环境暴露，限制了其真正的具身理解。需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场基础设施，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统进行可扩展模拟、多级奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: EmboBrain-7B在两个挑战性具身决策基准上超越了671B的DeepSeek-R1基线9.5%，展示了交互式环境基础学习的强大能力。

Conclusion: 通过EmboMatrix训练场，LLM可以从广泛的具身交互中涌现出具身决策能力，为构建真正智能的具身智能体提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD是一个无监督框架，通过联合建模空间上下文和时间动态来检测人类移动数据中的个体级异常，能够在大规模人群中捕获个性化行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式；采用行为聚类感知建模机制，构建个性化行为档案并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 能够检测行为转变和偏离既定常规的异常，并识别在大规模移动数据集中表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型处理随机性任务的能力，发现虽然LLM能产生一定随机性的输出，但表现不一致且与预期行为存在显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性（如随机决策、游戏、密码学任务），但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态（新鲜vs非新鲜）和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估随机性质量。

Result: LLM生成的输出虽然表现出一定程度的随机性，但性能不一致，且经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要改进才能有效处理此类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Result: 在23个测试场景中的16个上优于强基线方法，能够从最少无指导交互中成功学习关键环境动态，模拟推演成功识别出更优策略。

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，需要开发能够精确控制属性强度的AI系统以适应不同用户期望。

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数来预测部分生成的最终属性强度得分；3) 使用基于梯度的隐层表示干预来精确导航模型达到特定属性强度目标。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实该方法能够以高精度将文本生成引导至用户指定的属性强度，并在三个下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度连续控制，超越了简单的方向性对齐，为偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似优化以及对齐行为蒸馏等应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门的基准来评估和推动该领域的发展。

Method: 开发MatSciBench基准，包含1340个结构化问题，采用三级难度分类，支持多模态推理，并评估不同推理策略（思维链、工具增强、自我纠正）的效果。

Result: 评估显示即使是表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型在材料科学问题上的准确率也低于80%，不同推理策略在不同场景下表现各异，没有单一方法在所有情况下都表现优异。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了一个全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a

fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control

Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

### [203] [GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12218)
*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，且缺乏训练数据。开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出GOAT框架，从API文档自动生成合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行推理和生成连贯响应，支持相互依赖的API调用。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准上也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮评估框架，用于评估临床大语言模型在医患对话中的表现，通过知识图谱驱动的患者模拟和实时评估机制，发现传统评估方法容易忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型医学评估方法主要依赖事后回顾完整对话记录，无法捕捉医患多轮互动中的动态性和上下文敏感性，以及患者不断变化的信息需求。

Method: 1. 知识图谱驱动的患者模拟机制，通过控制模块从精心构建的知识图谱中检索相关医学事实，使患者代理具有类似人类的真实对话行为；2. 实时轮级评估框架，在对话进行过程中通过法官代理评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性；3. 构建包含八个最先进大语言模型的综合多轮基准测试。

Result: MedKGEval能够识别传统评估流程经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险，展示了其在临床大语言模型评估中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架虽然最初为中英文医学应用设计，但通过切换输入知识图谱可以轻松扩展到其他语言，确保无缝的双语支持和领域特定适用性。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习来自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预，提升LLM在特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前提示工程方法中手动设计耗时、缺乏动态策略选择、无法细粒度编辑提示以及经验复用不足的问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，结合基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PromptFlow能有效提升LLM在特定任务上的性能。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，显著减少了人工干预需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改进LLM主动推理训练，提升策略优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中容易出现信念偏差问题，导致跟踪问题状态困难、陷入无信息或重复动作，且强化学习训练无法正确归因关键探索步骤。

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度的信念偏差并在训练中截断轨迹，移除无信息的部分，保留信息前缀的信用。

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³持续提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，性能提升达30%，同时减少约25%的rollout token。

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发稳健且可泛化的LLM主动推理器的关键原则。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

### [207] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了张量逻辑语言，通过将神经网络和符号AI在基础层面统一起来，解决了现有AI编程语言的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展受阻于缺乏具备所有必要特性的编程语言。PyTorch和TensorFlow等库虽然提供了自动微分和GPU加速，但缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持；而LISP和Prolog等AI语言则缺乏可扩展性和学习支持。

Method: 提出张量逻辑语言，其唯一构造是张量方程，基于逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和本质上是相同操作的观察。所有其他功能都可以简化为这两种操作。

Result: 优雅地实现了神经网络、符号AI和统计AI的关键形式，包括变换器、形式推理、核机器和图模型。最重要的是，张量逻辑实现了嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和可学习性，以及符号推理的可靠性和透明度，可能成为AI更广泛采用的基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够处理文本、图像、表格和数学表达式等多种模态内容，通过双图构建和跨模态混合检索实现优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统仅限于处理文本内容，而现实世界中的知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式等多种内容形式，这种局限性导致了处理多模态文档时的根本性差距。

Method: 提出统一框架，将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体而非孤立的数据类型。采用双图构建来捕捉跨模态关系和文本语义，开发跨模态混合检索结合结构知识导航和语义匹配。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法有显著提升。在长文档处理方面性能提升尤为明显，传统方法在此类场景下表现不佳。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything建立了多模态知识访问的新范式，消除了当前系统存在的架构碎片化问题，为处理异构内容提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在数学研究中验证困难的问题，探索AI如何超越竞赛数学成为专业数学家的研究工具，回答Terence Tao关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐进不等式的问题。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，通过上下文符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证，形成迭代验证过程。

Result: 证明该框架在提出适当域分解方面非常有效，能够处理复杂的渐进不等式证明问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架成功展示了AI可以超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究工具，为研究级渐进分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了基于大型语言模型的Vibe Coding范式，通过分析1000多篇论文建立了理论框架和实践分类，揭示了成功Vibe Coding依赖于系统上下文工程、开发环境和人机协作模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"新范式，但该范式的有效性尚未充分探索，实证显示存在生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，使用约束马尔可夫决策过程形式化Vibe Coding，并综合现有实践为五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 建立了Vibe Coding的理论基础和实践框架，提供了该领域的首个全面分类法，揭示了成功Vibe Coding的关键要素。

Conclusion: 成功的Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更需要系统上下文工程、完善的开发环境和有效的人机协作模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估大语言模型在旅游定价场景中可靠性的基准测试，包含300个基于真实定价政策的问题，揭示了LLMs在复杂规则解释和算术推理方面的系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将容易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但在未经可靠性验证的情况下部署LLMs可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准测试，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLMs的评估显示，在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露了规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管具备通用能力，但当前LLMs在没有进一步保障措施或领域适应的情况下，在收入关键型应用中仍不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLMs结合，通过短期/长期记忆、用户选择机制和信念衰减机制，模拟跨主题观点演化，解决现有方法在捕捉多主题认知转移方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络中信息常涉及多个相关主题，现有基于LLM的研究多关注单一主题，传统数值模型将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏可解释性、行为一致性和多主题整合能力。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLMs与短期/长期记忆，采用多用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，使用信念衰减机制实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争缓解回音室效应。相比数值模型，LLM代理能更真实模拟动态观点变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架能更真实地模拟动态观点变化，再现新闻文本的语言特征，捕捉复杂的人类推理，提高模拟可解释性和系统稳定性。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，将长期碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了深度强化学习与注意力机制结合在自动驾驶决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评估者时的判断偏见，发现了11种偏见类型，并提出了四种缓解策略来确保AI评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在通信系统中被用于自主评估内容质量，这些AI"法官"的公正性无法保证，其评估标准中的任何偏见都可能扭曲结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 在点式评分设置下系统调查了两个LLM-as-a-judge模型的判断偏见，涵盖11种偏见类型，包括隐性和显性形式。

Result: 最先进的LLM法官对偏见输入表现出稳健性，通常给它们分配比相应干净样本更低的分数。提供详细的评分标准进一步增强了这种稳健性。在偏见数据上微调LLM会显著降低其性能。判断分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM法官在偏见检测方面表现出一定的稳健性，但训练数据中的偏见会严重影响性能。需要采取缓解策略来确保AI评估的公平可靠。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

*Chengpeng Hu,Calvin Yu-Chian Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习过程，强调跨模态、尺度、背景和干预的决策对齐评估，以解决当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室、平台迁移性以及剂量、时间效应处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单数据集验证中表现良好，但在跨实验室和平台迁移时存在限制，数据分割易受泄漏和覆盖偏差影响，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未系统处理。跨尺度耦合受限，分子、细胞和组织水平的锚点稀疏，与科学或临床读数的对齐在不同研究中差异较大。

Method: 提出模型无关的细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习：测量、提升/投影用于跨尺度耦合，干预用于剂量和调度。强调功能空间读数，如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Result: 提出了决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、背景和干预，推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏分割以及透明校准和报告，以实现可重复的同类比较。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法为AI虚拟细胞模型提供了系统化的学习和评估框架，有助于解决当前模型在跨平台迁移和跨尺度耦合中的挑战，推动可重复和决策相关的细胞状态建模。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

*Utsav Kumar Nareti,Suraj Kumar,Soumya Pandey,Soumi Chattopadhyay,Chandranath Adak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个半可解释的多标签文本分类框架，采用双阶段交替训练策略，通过原型发现和分类映射实现细粒度分析，在保持高性能的同时提供人类对齐的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）运行，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质，需要更细粒度的可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是半可解释多标签文本分类的稳健解决方案，能够捕获重叠和冲突语义，在性能和可解释性方面均表现优异。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

### [218] [HardcoreLogic: Challenging Large Reasoning Models with Long-tail Logic Puzzle Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12563)
*Jingcong Liang,Shijun Wan,Xuehai Wu,Siyuan Wang,Yitong Li,Qianglong Chen,Duyu Tang,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个10种逻辑游戏的谜题，通过增加复杂性、不常见元素和不可解谜题三个维度来测试大型推理模型的鲁棒性，发现现有模型严重依赖记忆模式而非真正推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注如9x9数独等流行谜题，容易导致模型过拟合标准格式和记忆解题模式，无法真正测试模型理解新规则或适应变体的能力。

Method: 设计HardcoreLogic基准，系统性地通过三个维度转换标准谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、不常见元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 在多样化的大型推理模型上评估显示性能显著下降，即使是在现有基准上得分最高的模型也表现不佳，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现困难。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，并为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Memory-as-Action框架，将工作内存管理重构为可学习的内部能力，通过强化学习联合优化任务推理和内存管理，解决了LLM在长视野任务中内存受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长视野智能体任务中面临内存受限的挑战，现有工作内存方法通常依赖与核心策略分离的外部启发式机制。

Method: 提出Memory-as-Action框架，让智能体通过执行显式编辑操作来主动管理工作内存，作为统一策略的一部分；为了解决轨迹断裂问题，提出了动态上下文策略优化算法。

Result: 端到端联合优化任务推理和内存管理不仅减少了总体计算消耗，还提高了任务性能，通过适应模型内在能力的自适应上下文管理策略。

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过统一策略联合优化任务和内存管理，能够有效提升LLM在长视野任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

TL;DR: ERA是一个两阶段框架，通过先验知识学习和在线强化学习，使小型视觉语言模型在具身AI任务中超越大型模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高性能具身AI系统依赖昂贵大模型，而小模型缺乏必要知识和技能的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过轨迹增强先验、环境锚定先验和外部知识先验学习基础知识；第二阶段采用自总结、密集奖励塑造和回合级策略优化的在线强化学习。

Result: ERA-3B在EB-ALFRED任务上提升8.4%，在EB-Manipulation任务上提升19.4%，超越GPT-4o，并展现出对未见任务的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多智能体辩论法官框架，通过协作推理和迭代优化提升LLM判断准确性，引入稳定性检测机制提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为法官的方法依赖简单聚合（如多数投票），即使个体智能体提供正确答案也可能失败，需要更有效的协作判断机制。

Method: 多智能体辩论框架，数学形式化辩论过程，使用时间变化的Beta-Binomial混合模型建模共识动态，基于Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验的自适应停止准则。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，该框架相比多数投票提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效提升LLM判断任务的准确性，通过协作推理和稳定性检测实现了精度和效率的平衡。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶、交通和医疗等安全关键系统中，AI系统需要在面对分布外样本、对抗攻击和环境变化时保持可靠性能，避免故障导致的严重后果。

Method: 结合自监督学习原理和图论技术，从无标签数据中学习有用表示，从而更有效地识别和分类OOD样本。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到了0.99的优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在处理分布外样本方面表现出色，为安全关键应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

TL;DR: CLUTCH是一种基于深度组合多臂老虎机的新型JavaScript模糊测试方法，通过注意力机制和Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略，相比现有方法在测试用例有效性和覆盖率方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript模糊测试方法在突变目标选择上采用随机策略，效率较低。作者认为突变目标选择问题适合用具有可变臂数的组合多臂老虎机来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合多臂老虎机，使用注意力机制处理可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过Concrete Dropout动态适应探索策略。

Result: 相比三种最先进解决方案，CLUTCH将有效测试用例数量和每个测试用例的覆盖率分别平均提高了20.3%和8.9%。在易变和组合设置中，CLUTCH的遗憾值分别至少减少了78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH通过深度组合多臂老虎机方法有效提升了JavaScript模糊测试的效率，在突变目标选择上优于随机方法和现有最先进的多臂老虎机算法。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，通过LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号权重中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度的控制来改变推荐结果。大语言模型提供了一种解决方案，允许用户通过自然语言请求来指导推荐。

Method: 在训练时，使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求是否会批准项目，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断，然后将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统优化的标准信号权重中。在部署时，每个用户请求只需要一次LLM嵌入计算，实现实时推荐控制。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求下都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和推荐满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法成功实现了通过自然语言对传统推荐系统的实时控制，提高了用户的控制感和满意度。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Motivation: 解决跨领域科学问题的自动定理证明需求，结合创造性推理和形式化严格性，提供可推广的形式化验证方法。

Method: 将大型语言模型与Lean工具通过模型上下文协议集成，构建多代理系统，支持自主证明和专家协作。

Result: 在公共数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争力相当，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中显著优于专门化系统，展示了跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于工具的代理化定理证明方法为跨科学领域的形式化验证提供了可推广的方法论，成功辅助专家数学家完成复杂密码学定理的形式化证明。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
