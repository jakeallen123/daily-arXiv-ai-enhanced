### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于多智能体推理的零样本食物识别框架，通过视觉-语言模型和大语言模型的协作对话实现无需训练的食物分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，无法有效处理未见过的食物类别，需要开发零样本识别方法。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕捉细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能食品质量检测和分析提供了一种新范式，无需额外训练或手动标注即可实现灵活、类人的复杂食物场景理解。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [2] [Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症中常见视觉表现（深色子宫内膜植入物）的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注识别区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多种视觉表现且出现在不同体内位置，使得其识别困难且容易出错，特别是对于非专科医生。该系统旨在为妇科医生提供辅助诊断工具。

Method: 训练一个系统来分析腹腔镜手术视频，识别深色子宫内膜植入物区域，并用多色叠加层进行标注，同时提供检测摘要以便视频浏览。

Result: 系统能够成功分析腹腔镜手术视频，识别并标注子宫内膜异位症植入物区域，提供检测摘要功能。

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生提供了有效的辅助工具，能够改善子宫内膜异位症的识别和诊断过程，特别是在腹腔镜手术视频分析方面。

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究结合传统视觉模型（YOLO）和视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）来提升遥感图像的飞机检测和场景理解能力，在标记和未标记数据以及退化图像场景中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且对复杂环境上下文理解有限，而视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在结合两者优势来改进遥感图像分析。

Method: 集成YOLO目标检测模型与多种视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini），在标记和未标记遥感数据以及退化图像场景中进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数准确率方面平均MAE提升48.46%，在挑战性条件下表现尤其突出；遥感图像综合理解的CLIPScore提升6.17%。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一个预后不良的组织学特征，但在病理学家之间存在显著的观察者间变异性且报告不足，需要提高检测的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，对640个数字化前列腺核心针活检切片进行训练，并在多个队列中进行内部和外部验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中表现出色（AUC: 0.97，Cohen's kappa: 0.81），在外部验证中表现稳健（AUC: 0.90，Cohen's kappa: 0.55），在评分者间分析中平均一致性最高（Cohen's kappa: 0.66），超过了九位病理学家。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善前列腺癌患者的治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，扩展对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动（模糊、遮挡、扭曲）效果不佳，这些扰动在现实世界中很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图结构的检索-推理增强生成框架，用于提升大型视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力，通过结构化图表示和中间推理步骤解决长视频处理中的时序依赖和无关信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视频语言模型处理长视频时面临的挑战：处理超出上下文窗口的密集视频token困难，以及难以保持长期时序信息。现有RAG方法在长视频中面临时序依赖破坏和无关信息干扰的问题。

Method: 提出Vgent框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) 使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；(2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，显式聚合跨片段的相关信息。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，Vgent相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，比最先进的视频RAG方法高出8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理步骤，有效提升了大型视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力，在多个基准测试中表现出显著性能改进。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型的时间学习框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI的视频具有挑战性，因为存在不同的主体、背景和非线性时间错位。

Method: TPL从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验显示TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在多样数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量手机照片创建超真实、保持身份特征的3D头像的零样本方法，通过生成式规范化模块和多视图处理解决现有方法的几何不一致和细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在单视图几何不一致和幻觉问题，以及合成数据训练无法捕捉高频细节的局限性，需要开发能保持身份特征且具有高真实感的3D头像生成方法。

Method: 采用"捕获、规范化、渲染"流水线，包括生成式规范化模块处理多视图为标准化表示，以及基于Transformer的模型在高质量高斯渲染头像数据集上训练。

Result: 该方法能从非结构化照片生成具有令人信服真实感和强大身份保持能力的静态半身头像。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本流水线成功解决了3D头像生成中的几何一致性和真实感问题，实现了身份保持的高质量头像创建。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析工具在可扩展性、效率和现代科学计算工作流集成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率和与现代科学计算工作流集成方面面临挑战。现有生物图像分析工具缺乏API、不支持GPU加速、3D图像处理能力有限，且对计算密集型工作流的互操作性差。

Method: cubic通过扩展广泛使用的SciPy和scikit-image API，集成CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM的GPU加速替代方案。其API是设备无关的，当数据位于设备上时调度到GPU执行，否则在CPU上执行，无缝加速各种图像处理例程。

Result: 通过基准测试单个操作和复制现有的去卷积和分割流程，cubic实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持了算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，包括其他GPU加速方法，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态方法，用于从人类行为中自动识别表面人格特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用Big Five模型，但忽略了HEXACO模型中的诚实-谦逊特质，该特质与攻击性、复仇倾向等相关。同时，机器学习建模时两种模型间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 通过联合优化Big Five和HEXACO的识别，利用多模态人类行为数据进行建模。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO可以改善多模态人类行为的认知，该方法在人格特质识别方面表现有效。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面引导的噪声图像生成、最大梯度补丁选择以及轻量级分类头结构。

Result: 在GenImage基准测试中达到98.9%的平均准确率，跨生成器泛化能力强，检测速度比现有方法快近百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在AI生成图像检测方面表现出色，具有高精度、强泛化能力和高效率的优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由先进生成模型（如GANs、扩散模型和神经渲染技术）生成的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 使用音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，构建了一个结合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索的多模态检测框架。

Result: 该方法通过识别多个互补模态之间的不一致性，显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了传统检测方法在识别现代深度伪造技术生成内容时的局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输，创下了基于事件OCC系统的比特率新纪录。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的独特特性，显著提升基于事件OCC系统的传输性能，为高速可见光通信提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: 提出MACE方法，通过混合专家网络和负载均衡策略，在大规模场景中实现高效定位和高质量渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高、单一网络容量有限的问题

Method: 引入门控网络选择子网络，提出无辅助损失的负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)，仅激活单个子网络进行推理

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低计算成本同时保持高精度

Conclusion: MACE为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了更高的精度

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

TL;DR: 提出IPRO框架，通过强化学习优化扩散模型，使用人脸身份评分器增强图像到视频生成中的身份一致性，特别针对人脸占比小的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性保持方面存在困难，特别是当视频中人脸表情变化大、运动剧烈或人脸在图像中占比很小时，这个问题尤为突出。

Method: 基于强化学习的视频扩散框架，使用人脸身份评分器进行直接有效的调优，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化来稳定训练。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效增强图像到视频生成中的身份保持能力，无需引入辅助模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Identity-GRPO为强化学习与个性化视频生成的结合提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配中存在的二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的问题，实现实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，通过残差连接迭代更新相对位置；设计MatchDecoder解码器，并引入门控跨MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，仅需3GB GPU内存；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法结合了高精度和低计算复杂度，使实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配成为可能。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Motivation: 高斯溅射方法在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉精细细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 集成2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化过程。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的精心结合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Result: 在CAMELYON17数据集和私有组织病理学数据集上验证，在未见域上实现一致性能提升，最高达到7%的改进

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中域偏移问题的有力工具

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统易受呈现攻击（如人工眼睛、打印图像、美容隐形眼镜），但缺乏足够的训练数据来开发有效的呈现攻击检测方法。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN，结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，通过多领域架构在真实眼部图像和不同呈现攻击领域之间进行转换，并采用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决虹膜生物识别中数据稀缺问题，显著提升呈现攻击检测性能。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制有效解决了MLLMs中视觉信息监督不足的问题，显著提升了模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在细粒度空间感知能力上存在不足，如生成详细区域描述或精确定位对象时表现不佳，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。

Method: SPR方法引入语义和定位评分来全面评估MLLM生成描述的质量，通过直接偏好优化将最佳定位精度的细化描述与最低分的初始描述配对，增强与视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励机制，成功提升了多模态大语言模型的细粒度空间感知能力，在最小训练开销下实现了更好的空间理解性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象忽略或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于对CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入输入文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中获得了比其他四种竞争方法多26.24%-43.04%的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice系数分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在提出的五个系统fold上，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice增益分别为0.86%和1.45%，同时实现15倍效率提升。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提高了计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割任务中的鲁棒性和计算优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

*Brandon Hill,Kma Solaiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于检测主板组装缺陷的可复现框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型并采用置信度-时间投票方法，在MiracleFactory数据集上实现了精度和召回率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主板组装缺陷检测对高产量电子制造至关重要，但现有研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，组装级检测研究不足。

Method: 基准测试了YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN两种检测器，并提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，同时评估了在锐度、亮度和方向变化等现实扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: YOLOv7在精度上表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反；CTV Voter集成方法有效平衡了性能；在现实扰动下存在稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术从基准结果向实际主板组装制造质量保证的过渡，并发布了可部署的GUI检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCMIL模型，通过双课程对比多实例学习处理全切片图像，无需密集标注即可实现癌症预后预测，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临千兆像素级图像的计算瓶颈和密集标注稀缺问题，现有方法常忽略多放大倍率下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习模型DCMIL，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接处理全切片图像进行预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万图块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，能识别细粒度预后关键区域并提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理WSI图像，发现正常与肿瘤组织的形态差异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过自适应帧内/帧间编码和双向两帧压缩设计，有效处理遮挡、新内容等问题，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容、帧间误差传播等方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中帧内编码的优势来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架，使用单一模型自适应执行帧内/帧间编码；采用同时两帧压缩设计，利用前向和后向帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均减少10.7% BD-rate，提供更稳定的帧级码率和质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该方案通过引入帧内编码工具和双向压缩设计，有效解决了现有NVC方案的局限性，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但深度学习目标检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击方法在有效性上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种高效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但参数量过大导致计算效率低下。需要找到在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数的方法。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重，同时将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，从而发现高性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务的基准数据集上，MIR-L模型仅保留10%的可训练参数，同时保持了高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代剪枝方法能够有效压缩多任务图像恢复模型，在极高稀疏度下发现性能优异的小型子网络，为计算效率提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 使用Sentinel-2卫星时间序列数据检测牧场放牧活动，通过CNN-LSTM集成模型实现77%的F1分数，能显著提高牧场检查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对多边形定义的牧场边界进行二分类预测（放牧/未放牧）。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1分数达到77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在只能检查4%场地的情况下，优先检查模型预测的未放牧场地可使确认的未放牧场地数量比随机检查增加17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费的卫星数据可以可靠地指导保护性土地利用合规检查的资源分配。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出优于ViT的线性扩展性和比CNN更少的可训练参数，这些特性使其在计算和内存效率方面具有优势，适合用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测任务。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，与ViT和CNN模型在多个方面进行渗透率预测性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba相比ViT和CNN在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中的优势，包括更好的计算效率和内存效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT，源代码已公开以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种噪声投影器，通过文本条件优化将初始噪声映射到更适合预训练Stable Diffusion模型的提示感知噪声，以解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时噪声来自提示无关的高斯先验，导致生成图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 提出噪声投影器框架：采样噪声→通过视觉语言模型获取token级反馈→蒸馏到奖励模型→通过准直接偏好优化优化噪声投影器，将噪声映射到提示感知版本。

Result: 实验表明，提示感知噪声投影显著提高了各种提示下的文本-图像对齐质量，且推理成本低。

Conclusion: 该方法无需参考图像或手工先验，通过单次前向传播即可改善文本到图像生成的对齐效果，为训练-推理不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

Method: 使用两个编码器提取域不变特征和域特定特征，通过对抗训练和图像重建（将两个特征的重构相加）来确保协调性和信息保留。

Result: 在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别任务中达到或优于现有方法性能，并能可视化域独立和域特定脑部特征。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA在保持高性能的同时提供了高可解释性，解决了医疗应用中域协调和模型解释性的关键问题。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习内部表示不透明难以解释，而经典视觉描述符（如边缘、颜色、强度分布）对人类直观可理解。研究现代学习是否能从这些经典线索中受益。

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个描述符作为独立但互补的视觉知识组件，采用重建驱动的预训练方案。

Result: 该方法能够捕获每个视觉描述符的本质同时保持可解释性，在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中实现有效的属性控制。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面具有有效性，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

TL;DR: 提出Flow Matching Alignment (FMA)方法，通过多步调整实现跨模态特征对齐，相比传统单步PEFT方法在复杂数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调(PEFT)方法都是单步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够有效，需要多步调整能力。

Method: 学习跨模态速度场，使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应，噪声增强缓解数据稀缺，早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上显著提升性能，特别是在挑战性数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现更精确鲁棒的对齐，优于传统单步PEFT方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种训练无关的提示嵌入编辑方法SDeC，通过解构T2I模型内置的场景上下文关联来解决身份偏移问题，无需预先知道所有目标场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，特别是当模型在训练过程中自然形成了主体与场景上下文的相关性时，传统方法需要预先知道所有目标场景的假设不现实。

Method: 提出场景去上下文化(SDeC)方法，通过识别和抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-ID相关性，量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重新加权相应特征值。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，其中先验知识通常不可用或随时间变化。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯溅射训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯密度化过程中的密度分配偏斜、高斯投影中的计算负载不平衡以及颜色溅射中的内存访问碎片化。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上实现了1.44倍的训练加速，且质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练效率问题，在保持重建质量的同时显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型仅限于对象级或区域级定位，缺乏通过自然语言进行像素级精确关键点理解的能力。

Result: 在LlamaPointInPart数据集上的实验显示优于基线模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新应用方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成在视觉质量上取得进展，但保持连贯的对象运动和交互仍然困难，主要瓶颈包括运动提示编码后有效token过少，以及外观和运动优化冲突导致时间一致性差。

Method: 提出实例线索（将稀疏用户编辑提示转换为密集2.5D运动场）和密集RoPE（在token空间保持运动提示显著性），结合RGB+辅助图联合预测。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架通过简单组件有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，无需复杂的逐帧轨迹脚本。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过改进多模态查询和检索过程，显著提升了KB-VQA任务的性能，证明了该方法在整合视觉理解和知识检索方面的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕，同时捕捉击球级动作和战术级动态执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单的即插即用方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，从而降低处理成本并提高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性，长视频常常超出语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧中保持不变的空间区域）来减少令牌冗余。该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS显著减少令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，使推理速度更快且输入序列更长。在推理时应用EVS，可将大型语言模型的首令牌时间减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: EVS持续改善效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器生成的单个连续潜在token来表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，探索微调自监督表示作为紧凑有效潜在空间的潜力。

Method: 基于预训练SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失保持原始SSL空间几何特性。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成中取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限训练预算达到竞争性零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，为高效生成建模提供新途径。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

*Jihyun Yu,Yoojin Oh,Wonho Bae,Mingyu Kim,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一种仅推理的测试时适应框架，使用Feynman-Kac引导来指导基于扩散的输入适应，通过伪标签驱动的奖励来提升分类性能，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度的扩散TTA方法在探索和跨失真类型泛化方面的局限性，提出无需模型更新或源数据的测试时适应方法。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，通过累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度，使用伪标签驱动的奖励指导扩散过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于不进行任何模型更新或使用源数据的基线方法。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA框架通过引导机制有效提升了测试时适应的性能，无需模型更新即可在分布偏移下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

*Xinyao Liao,Xianfang Zeng,Ziye Song,Zhoujie Fu,Gang Yu,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从无配对视频剪辑中学习视频编辑能力，显著提升了基于指令的视频编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本和复杂性过高。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在约100万真实视频剪辑上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万精选编辑对上进行微调以扩展编辑任务并提升编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有方法，编辑指令遵循能力提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该策略成功实现了高效的基于指令的视频编辑，通过低成本预训练和少量高质量数据微调即可获得优秀的编辑能力。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: DBP-MAE通过将去相关反向传播集成到MAE预训练中，在保持稳定性的同时加速收敛，减少21.1%训练时间、21.4%碳排放，并提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现优异，但计算成本高昂，难以在工业环境中实用。

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性集成去相关反向传播(DBP)，通过逐层减少输入相关性来加速收敛。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE减少21.1%训练时间、21.4%碳排放，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点。工业数据上也观察到类似增益。

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中减少训练时间和能耗，同时提升下游任务性能，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

TL;DR: EuroMineNet是首个基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像的采矿足迹制图与监测多时相基准数据集，涵盖欧盟133个采矿点2015-2024年的年度观测数据，支持采矿足迹制图和跨时相变化检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建多时相基准数据集，提供专家验证的注释，支持GeoAI模型分析环境动态，并引入新的Change-Aware Temporal IoU评估指标。

Result: 对20个最先进深度学习模型的基准测试显示，GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及GeoAI在社会和环境福祉方面的应用。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了WeCKD方法，通过链式知识蒸馏解决传统KD方法的知识退化、监督效率低和数据依赖问题，在有限数据场景下实现高效知识传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强教师模型或大数据集，在真实世界有限数据场景下效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习，还精炼知识后传递，每个模型仅使用部分数据集训练。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在另外两个数据集上验证了跨医学成像模态的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据下准确率提升高达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递链，显著降低了数据依赖，在有限监督下实现了高效学习，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Result: 在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基准上，视频时序定位和推理问答任务均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合式和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习图像先验的3D高斯泼溅压缩框架，通过恢复网络建模压缩伪影，利用粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，显著提升率失真性能并减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅压缩技术虽然显著减少了存储开销，但缺乏学习先验限制了率失真权衡的进一步提升。需要解决压缩引起的质量退化问题。

Method: 在初始压缩高斯基础上，构建恢复网络在图像空间建模压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，通过恢复图像监督优化压缩高斯表示。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，在率失真性能上优于现有最先进的3DGS压缩方法，渲染质量更高且存储需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有高斯压缩方法，通过结合学习图像先验，实现了更紧凑的高斯表示和增强的渲染性能。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Motivation: 传统鲸鱼监测方法昂贵且难以扩展，而现有基于高分辨率卫星图像的自动检测方法面临标注数据缺乏、图像质量变化和环境条件差异等挑战。

Method: 采用统计异常检测方法标记空间异常点（"有趣点"），配合网页标注界面让专家快速验证这些点，不依赖标注训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来基于卫星的海洋哺乳动物监测提供了可扩展的第一步，且已开源相关代码。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制大多局限于单层或双层特征，忽略了多尺度表示间的丰富层间依赖关系，限制了检测尺度变化大的物体的能力

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表示），集成到SSD300框架中

Result: 在PASCAL VOC上达到78.6% mAP（基线75.5%），在COCO上达到52.1% mAP（基线43.1%），优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛而不增加显著计算开销

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对于推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注通常具有不同的粒度级别，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求的影响，而现有方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性，创建混合粒度标签；提出free-grain学习框架，结合伪属性（来自视觉语言模型）和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 所提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提高了分层分类性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法推动了在现实约束下的分层分类研究进展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明可信的AI系统至关重要，现有方法通常需要训练数据或真实标签，而DEXTER旨在提供无需数据的自然语言解释。

Method: 通过优化文本提示合成类条件图像来强烈激活目标分类器，然后利用这些合成样本生成详细的自然语言报告，描述类特定的决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类级偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示其输出准确且可解释。

Conclusion: DEXTER提供了一个灵活的无数据框架，能够有效揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，在激活最大化、切片发现与去偏、偏见解释等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

TL;DR: LightQANet是一个用于低光图像增强的新框架，通过量化自适应特征学习解决现有方法在低光条件下特征提取不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法由于在低光条件下像素级信息严重退化，无法提取可靠的特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 提出LightQANet框架，包含静态建模的Light Quantization Module(LQM)提取和量化光照相关因子，以及动态适应的Light-Aware Prompt Module(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态指导特征学习。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下实现了最先进的性能，提供优越的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习，能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致和鲁棒图像质量增强。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星探测任务依赖VR技术，但火星高度图存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个NASA HiRISE火星高度图增强数据集上训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个测试样本上，相比逆距离加权、克里金和纳维-斯托克斯算法，该方法在RMSE上提升4-15%，在LPIPS感知相似度上提升29-81%。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面，填补高度图缺失值，为VR应用提供更准确的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV集群中面临频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找替代通信方案。蜜蜂摇摆舞的视觉通信方式提供了灵感。

Method: 使用四种运动基元（上下、左右、左-上-右、左-下-右）作为控制符号，通过事件相机捕获MAV运动模式，设计基于事件帧的分割模型和轻量级SNN进行动作识别和解码。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好的通信性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV集群提供了一种节能的替代通信方案，特别适用于无线电受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个用于开放词汇目标检测的新框架，通过引入视觉链式思维推理来改进伪标签生成过程，特别针对拥挤和遮挡场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法主要依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景下鲁棒性有限。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景下，新类别的伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%。在开放词汇COCO上实现了+7.7 AP50的提升，在LVIS上新类别实现了+2.9 mask AP的提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，CoT-PL显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景下的性能，特别是在处理拥挤和遮挡场景时表现出色。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物学过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱来表征表型多样性，反映了恶性转化通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原则。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），比现有结直肠癌特定方法高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的鲁棒性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM模型通过整合连续形态变异谱，在结直肠癌预后预测中表现出色，为理解肿瘤进化和临床决策提供了新的可解释AI工具。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，无需依赖大量手工绘制的肿瘤掩模，显著降低了AI训练成本，并在多种肿瘤类型上实现了优于放射科医生的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI肿瘤分割模型需要大量手工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中每份CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型，使其能够根据医学报告中的肿瘤描述进行肿瘤分割，利用101,654份医学报告进行训练，大幅减少了对手工掩模的依赖。

Result: 仅使用医学报告训练的AI模型性能与使用723个手工掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模训练后，敏感性提升13%，特异性提升8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测性能超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了大规模手工肿瘤掩模创建不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测提供了一条可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新颖的轨迹表示学习框架，通过统一环境感知和显式路径选择建模来学习有效的轨迹表示，在多个下游任务中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对轨迹形成的影响，导致表示能力不足。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器，前者从周围POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义，后者将道路段转换建模为决策序列来捕捉路径选择行为。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过整合环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的效果，为轨迹分析任务提供了更强大的基础。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型在智能手机等移动设备上部署时面临的内存和计算限制问题，同时保持模型生成质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法，渐进式降低模型参数精度(从32位到4位)，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高质量生成。

Result: 在多种扩散模型(SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart、FLUX.1-schnell)上实现了改进的质量，比标准QAT降低4-7%的FiD分数，并成功在三星S25U手机上部署运行。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了大模型在移动设备部署时的量化挑战，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效部署。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模、体素级标注的肿瘤数据集，AI肿瘤分割性能受限。作者发现合成数据可以显著减少对真实数据的需求，因此创建了大规模标注数据集来提升AI性能。

Method: 创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，15,130个肿瘤实例，涵盖胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管和子宫六个器官，由23名放射科专家进行体素级手动标注。

Result: 在内部JHH数据集实验中，使用合成数据仅需500个真实扫描即可达到与1,500个真实扫描相同的性能。AbdomenAtlas 2.0在分布内测试中DSC提升7%，分布外测试中提升16%。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以显著提升数据缩放效率，大规模标注数据集为AI肿瘤分割提供了坚实基础，AbdomenAtlas 2.0在多个器官上实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Motivation: 真实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态或双模态。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立模态，特别是在无人类监督的情况下。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合方法，基于原始视频构建全自动数据流水线。采用专门设计的PHG-MAE模型来利用多模态数据，并将其高效蒸馏为小参数模型。

Conclusion: 证明了通过多模态整合和无监督学习，可以开发出高效的小参数模型，在真实世界应用中具有竞争力，同时开源了数据流水线框架。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化、物理合理的手-物体交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，受物理先验（如力闭合）约束，无法捕捉日常交互的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，并提出TOUCH三阶段框架，基于多级扩散模型实现细粒度语义控制，利用显式接触建模和物理约束优化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样化且物理合理的手部交互，涵盖推、戳、旋转等多种自由形式交互。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互的范围，为日常活动中的手-物体交互提供了更真实的生成能力。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型系列，专门针对自车威胁进行优化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，包含BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注基准数据集以识别自车参与情况。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS通过专门的自车中心化评估框架有效解决了碰撞预测中的误报问题，并发布了模型权重和重新标注的数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高保真度和精确控制，改进了MMDiT模块并引入参考注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在生成质量和推理效率方面取得了显著进展，但在VAR范式下实现精确灵活的控制机制仍未被充分探索，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 提出了ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的非必要注意力，降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用，利用VAR骨干能力处理控制信息，配备零初始化线性投影确保控制信号有效融入而不破坏基础模型生成能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法，通过两阶段处理解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类任务中处理自由形式响应和大量选项的评估挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法应对细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且难以扩展到基于检索的问题。

Method: 使用两阶段方法：先向MLLM提出开放式问题获得自由响应，然后使用仅文本约束解码预测最可能的选项；在检索设置中采用提前停止方法显著提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索评估指标上均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理大量选项和自由形式响应的评估挑战，提升了分类和检索性能。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻对象对的视觉输入，生成活动和交互的文本描述，在测试时与正常训练视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了复杂异常检测能力，还提供了内在的可解释性，并能与传统VAD方法结合增强其可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Motivation: 由于密集视频对象字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略可能导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用最先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集创建LVISCap和LV-VISCap，训练MaskCaptioner模型实现联合检测、分割、跟踪和字幕生成。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap上进行预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个现有基准测试中取得了最先进的密集视频对象字幕结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集和端到端训练策略，MaskCaptioner有效解决了密集视频对象字幕任务，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件和3D场景记忆实现精确相机控制和场景一致性，在长视频生成中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频生成，难以在长视频生成中保持场景一致性和精确相机控制，特别是在跨越时间边界时动态元素会错误保留。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆存储静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 实验表明该框架在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt通过结合3D场景记忆和双时空条件，成功解决了长视频生成中的场景一致性和相机控制问题，同时保持计算效率和运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Motivation: 解决全身多模态人体运动生成的两个主要挑战：创建有效的运动生成机制，以及将文本、语音、音乐等多种模态整合到一个统一的框架中。

Method: 开发连续掩码自回归运动变换器，采用因果注意力考虑人体运动的序列性质；引入门控线性注意力和RMSNorm模块关注关键动作并抑制异常运动或多模态异质分布带来的不稳定性；使用DiT结构扩散变换器的条件到目标；通过AdaLN和交叉注意力融合文本、语音和音乐信号。

Conclusion: 提出的连续掩码自回归运动变换器框架在多模态人体运动生成方面表现出色，能够有效处理多种输入模态并生成高质量的运动序列。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在处理复杂运动时存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、平滑且缺乏上下文一致性，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入RealDPO对齐范式，使用真实世界视频作为正样本，通过DPO损失函数对比真实视频与错误模型输出，实现迭代自校正；同时构建RealAction-5K高质量视频数据集。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效提升了视频生成模型的运动合成质量，为复杂运动生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个完整的工具包，包括框架、数据集和基准，为解锁LMM中复杂、类人的视觉辅助推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频中恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入短时和长时对应关系，将现有的3D重建方法扩展到动态场景，实现动态几何和相机姿态的联合估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确的结果，因为运动物体破坏了多视角几何约束。

Method: C4D在预测点图的基础上，捕获短时光流和长时点跟踪两种对应关系，训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，分离运动物体与静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: C4D通过引入时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，为动态场景理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Conclusion: 提出的token-wise attention集成方法有效解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，实现了更高效的时空依赖建模

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集和引入对比身份损失，解决了身份一致生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份相似性的同时实现多样化的可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致生成模型依赖重建式训练，导致copy-paste问题——直接复制参考人脸而非在姿势、表情、光照等自然变化中保持身份，这削弱了可控性和生成表达能力。

Method: 1) 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，为每个身份提供多样化参考；2) 提出量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度-变化权衡的基准；3) 引入对比身份损失的新训练范式，利用配对数据平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了姿势和表情的可控性，保持了强感知质量。用户研究验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了copy-paste问题，在身份一致生成中实现了保真度与多样性的更好平衡，为表达性可控生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器从交互姿态生成动态运动序列，姿态生成器从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态上下文信息，人类能凭此直观推断上下文并预测可能的过去和未来动态。受此启发，作者希望利用交互姿态先验来实现通用交互动画。

Method: 使用运动捕捉交互数据集中的近距离双人姿态及其周围时间上下文作为训练数据。采用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列，姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实证实验证明了姿态先验的通用性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator支持图像驱动的交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多种任务，促进了交互知识从高质量运动捕捉数据到开放世界场景的迁移。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会损害3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，再解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面都达到了最先进的性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程即可从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取，而使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的伪影

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型，训练时展开模型并利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令和保留未变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，与使用大量监督配对数据训练的各种图像编辑扩散模型在少步设置下表现相当，使用相同VLM作为奖励模型时也优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，提供了一种有效的无监督图像编辑训练范式，在保持性能的同时避免了合成训练对带来的伪影传播问题

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个核心挑战：明确其与模块化模型的根本差异限制，以及如何使原生VLMs研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 提出构建原生VLMs的三个指导原则：在共享语义空间中对齐像素和词表示、无缝整合视觉和语言模块优势、内嵌支持统一视觉语言编码和推理的跨模态特性。基于这些原则开发了NEO模型系列。

Result: NEO仅使用3.9亿图像-文本对就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知，在密集单块模型中缓解视觉语言冲突，在多样化现实场景中能够匹敌顶级模块化模型。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展且强大的原生VLMs奠定了基础，提供了丰富的可重用组件，促进成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过耦合扩散采样技术实现多视角一致的图像编辑，无需显式3D优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时缺乏视角间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长和稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用隐式3D正则化方法，通过耦合扩散采样同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，使用耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，展示了其适用于各种模型架构的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用GRPO框架结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。在MultiSpider数据集上微调LLaMA-3-3B模型。

Result: 执行准确率提升至87.4%(比零样本提高26个百分点)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(提高32.86个百分点)。添加对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步达到59.14%(提高6.85个百分点，越南语最高提高10个百分点)。仅用3000个强化学习训练样本，3B模型在执��准确率上超越8B零样本模型7.43个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号实现定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Motivation: 当前可解释AI技术在心理健康筛查中存在实验室到临床应用的鸿沟，SHAP和LIME等技术虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但缺乏临床相关性和可操作性，无法被临床医生使用或患者理解。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，以大语言模型为核心翻译引擎，整合多样化XAI工具的技术输出，结合临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、基于证据的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流整合、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍，推动领域从生成孤立数据点向提供集成化、可操作且可信赖的AI解决方案发展。

Conclusion: 生成式操作框架为心理健康筛查中的可解释AI提供了从技术透明性到临床实用性的转化路径，是实现AI在临床实践中真正应用的关键战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

<details>

Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型特定信号（如token级熵），需要访问模型logits，阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信号的水印方法。

Method: 利用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性强的上下文增强信号以提高可检测性。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和粘着性韩语上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的定义存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕获每个组合的独特特征，构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 文化感知的个体仇恨子空间框架能有效提升仇恨言论检测性能，特别是在处理文化差异和标签模糊性方面。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高且难以扩展。用户在日常使用中产生的偏好标签能更好反映其真实需求，但缺乏质量控制。

Method: 通过两个不同模型生成响应，构建用户行为模型，使用期望最大化(EM)算法估计用户的潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式收集的偏好数据结合质量过滤机制，为LLM对齐提供了可扩展且高质量的替代方案。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优token选择，限制了LLM在真实应用中的部署。

Method: 引入informed routing范式，使用轻量级特征预测器(LFF)在路由决策前估计单元输出，实现灵活的execute-or-approximate策略。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上实现最先进的效率-性能权衡，即使没有最终LoRA微调也能匹配或超越需要全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: informed routing通过前瞻性地评估token重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了贪婪路由的信息丢失问题，为LLM高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

Conclusion: HIES通过结合重要性和熵信息，有效克服了HIS的局限性，为Transformer模型剪枝提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流、1420个问题和评估工具，旨在评估LLM在复杂交互式数据分析任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务通常目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清意图。现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或提供对交互性的支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了系统评估工具。

Result: 评估显示，新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续、长形式交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务中进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒UQ方法能够有效估计LLM的置信度，为可信AI系统提供了实用的不确定性量化解决方案。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的AI代理框架，将原始网络流量数据转换为结构化语义表示，实现交互式分析和威胁检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络产生多样化的高流量数据，需要跨层解释行为、协议和上下文，而非孤立检测

Method: 集成特征提取、基于Transformer的异常检测、数据包和流量摘要、威胁情报增强以及检索增强问答的AI代理框架

Result: 在多个物联网数据集和六个开源模型上的实验表明，混合检索方法显著提升了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore指标

Conclusion: 该框架在低CPU、GPU和内存开销下，实现了对物联网网络流量的全面高效解释

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（部分整体关系），该方法优于现有的BERT基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时耗力，需要自动化方法来处理大量非结构化文本数据，特别是在电子商务领域需要有效组织产品信息。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）开发完全自动化的方法，从原始评论文本中提取产品本体，形式为部分整体关系（meronymies）。

Result: 该方法提取的本体在使用LLM作为评判标准时，超越了现有的基于BERT的基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为在（产品或其他）本体提取中更广泛使用LLMs奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对RAG系统知识库的少样本语义对齐投毒攻击，能够在事实核查场景中翻转LLM的判断并生成欺骗性解释，无需访问目标模型或检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为在可信证据占主导的情况下，传统攻击效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击方法，使用少样本、语义对齐的方式向知识库注入对抗性内容，影响检索结果和LLM输出。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT平均攻击成功率86%，中毒率仅0.93×10^-6，比现有最佳攻击提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界RAG事实核查系统的严重脆弱性，即使在强反证据存在时仍保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格和事件特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，通过在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计用于编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比现有最先进的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 在医疗基础模型预训练中，时间序列化对于提升模型性能具有重要意义。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇中，解决了传统固定词汇子集方法在推测解码中的局限性，提高了接受长度并保持验证的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中，草稿模型的输出头参数成为延迟瓶颈。固定词汇子集方法虽然减少计算，但存在脆弱性：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调整，静态短列表抑制了罕见或领域特定token，降低了每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 引入轻量级、粗粒度的元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇中；选定的前k个簇的并集形成草稿模型的短列表，而验证保留完整词汇和精确性。通过并行执行草稿编码和元短列表计算，元分类器比草稿模型隐藏状态生成更早完成计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度的一致提升，同时上下文相关选择使得能够使用更小的短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速草稿过程并能泛化到多样化任务的动态短列表机制，解决了固定词汇子集方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Motivation: 标准参数高效微调方法在处理复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时存在困难，需要解决同时执行多个任务的有效集成问题。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，实现任务有效集成，同时保持计算效率，避免大量重训练或顺序处理。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源受限的实际应用中具有潜在优势，展示了组合多任务处理的实用可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言LLM中的意外代码切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用PCA在平行翻译数据上识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，该方法只需少量平行数据进行校准。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，多个语言对的下一token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份集中在最终层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能以可忽略的计算开销缓解代码切换问题，同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLMs使用基于统计的子词分词器，但语法相同的代码可能因格式差异而被不同分词，这可能导致模型行为不一致。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体，分析九个代码LLMs的行为变化。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，层间分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕获语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不匹配是代码LLMs可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，解决中间步骤不忠实或难以解释的问题。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行验证。

Result: 发现成功的LLM推理在全局上是非均匀的：正确解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征。

Conclusion: 这一发现挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新和保留的知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，对每个传入的编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化信息环境中的LLM设计提供了简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试，用于衡量不同用户角色下大型语言模型的事实一致性，发现模型对不同人口统计特征的用户会给出事实不一致的回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试当不同人口统计特征的用户询问相同问题时，LLM是否会给出事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个主题请求5个事实，重复100次查询，每次添加不同用户角色的提示上下文，通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度来评估事实一致性。

Result: 在100个角色的实验中，一致性得分范围从0.9065到0.7896，平均为0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，多个轻量级模型排名最低。不同主题的一致性差异明显，就业市场最不一致，G7世界领导人最一致。

Conclusion: 模型提供商和主题都会影响事实一致性，需要开发角色不变的提示策略来确保回答的一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，而在私有企业数据仓库中效果较差。手动标注SQL日志以构建基准测试成本高昂且耗时。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM生成多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑这些草稿。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估表明，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准测试所需的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性和基准可靠性。

Conclusion: BenchPress为研究人员和从业者提供了评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制，结合人类验证和LLM生成建议增强了模型评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses

### [122] [R2T: Rule-Encoded Loss Functions for Low-Resource Sequence Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13854)
*Mamadou K. Keita,Christopher Homan,Sebastien Diarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则集成到神经网络训练目标中，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练Zarma词性标注达到98.2%准确率，优于有监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言标注数据稀缺问题，探索基于原则而非纯数据驱动的学习范式（PrL），让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行学习。

Method: 提出Rule-to-Tag框架，将多层语言规则系统集成到神经网络训练目标中，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: 在Zarma词性标注任务上，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率，优于在300个标注句子上微调的AfriBERTa；在NER任务中，R2T预训练后仅用50个标注句子微调的模型优于在300个句子上训练的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架在低资源场景下表现出色，证明了原则学习范式的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖，为资源匮乏语言处理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一种利用模型一致性来增强大语言模型集成鲁棒性的即插即用技术，通过token级和模型级一致性处理集成中的错误信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同大语言模型具有互补能力，但集成方法对错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，这些错误信号源于异构分词方案和模型能力差异。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：token级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；模型级一致性通过提升高自信且与其他模型差异小的模型输出来增强全局一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过token级和模型级一致性机制，有效提升了LLM集成的鲁棒性和性能，可无缝集成到各种集成方法中。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

TL;DR: MasonNLP系统使用基于检索增强生成(RAG)的通用领域大语言模型，在MEDIQA-WV 2025伤口护理VQA任务中获得第三名，证明了轻量级RAG方法在医疗多模态NLP任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中的伤口护理问题，支持临床决策和患者护理，需要生成自由文本回答和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，整合领域内文本和视觉示例，通过简单索引和融合添加相关示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排序。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第三，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLMs结合，作为最小推理时间层，为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShishuLM是一种高效的语言模型架构，通过减少参数数量和KV缓存需求，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算冗余，特别是在小型语言模型中，这为优化提供了机会。

Method: 利用AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，通过将整个transformer块近似为多层感知机来减少架构冗余。

Result: ShishuLM在训练和推理阶段分别实现了高达25%的内存减少和40%的延迟改善。

Conclusion: 该研究为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

*Chenyu Zhang,Sharifa Alghowinem,Cynthia Breazeal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模辅导对话中的情感感知，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在AI辅导中通常呈现轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度，但学习过程并非一帆风顺，困惑和好奇常伴随问题解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导辅导的情感动态仍未充分理解。本文旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进将生成式AI整合到教育中的负责任路径。

Method: 分析了两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计值。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是问题解决的常见伴侣；挫折虽然较少但会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情感常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻更多地将学生引导向上而非向下，这为辅导者在这些关键时刻进行干预提供了机会，强调了在AI辅导中关注情感动态的重要性。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型虽然是有前景的自回归模型替代方案，但其推理策略仍局限于自回归范式的前缀提示方法，需要专门针对DLMs设计的条件生成方法。

Method: 模板填充（TI）方法：先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码片段；动态片段分配（DSA）：根据生成置信度自适应调整片段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法取得了17.01%的显著提升，并在多token生成设置中实现了有效的加速同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 模板填充方法为扩散语言模型提供了更有效的推理策略，在保持生成质量的同时实现了性能提升和加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Under-resourced languages, such as Quechuas, face data and resource scarcity,
hindering their development in speech technology. To address this issue, Common
Voice presents a crucial opportunity to foster an open and community-driven
speech dataset creation. This paper examines the integration of Quechua
languages into Common Voice. We detail the current 17 Quechua languages,
presenting Puno Quechua (ISO 639-3: qxp) as a focused case study that includes
language onboarding and corpus collection of both reading and spontaneous
speech data. Our results demonstrate that Common Voice now hosts 191.1 hours of
Quechua speech (86\% validated), with Puno Quechua contributing 12 hours (77\%
validated), highlighting the Common Voice's potential. We further propose a

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different
expressions), and 2043 unique composite expressions (from 11144 different

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，可在仅解码器语言模型中实现token级别的层跳过，通过可微分的sigmoid线性门来压缩分支输出，在推理时根据门值跳过低重要性token，节省计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，开发一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过机制。

Method: 在每个Attention/MLP分支上配备sigmoid线性门，压缩分支输出后重新进入残差流；推理时根据门值对token排序，使用每层预算跳过低重要性token。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省15%计算成本同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型中，全计算时获得准确率提升，50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，可与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术结合使用，同时学习的门控机制揭示了transformer信息流模式。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定性下的顺序决策能力。Qwen3-4B模型表现最佳，达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，优于传统算法和其他LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，目前这方面研究较少。

Method: 创建多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过文本反馈（"你获得了一个代币"）与环境交互，没有数值线索或显式概率，需要从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B模型达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大规模的LLMs和传统方法（Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB等）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值上下文中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Catch Your Breath(CYB)训练方法，让语言模型能动态调整每个输入token的计算步数，通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token提供额外计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入复杂度自主调整计算资源分配，在需要更多思考时请求暂停，提高计算效率。

Method: 提出三种CYB损失函数：CYB-AP(随时预测)、CYB-VA(变分方法)、CYB-DP(计算预算惩罚)，通过微调实验确定最佳变体。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能根据token复杂度和上下文自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: CYB方法有效提升了语言模型的计算效率，使模型能够智能地分配计算资源，在复杂token处请求更多处理时间。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成的质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一个简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟大多局限于选择题或简答形式，忽略了LLM的生成特性。这种封闭设计无法真实反映社会现象，需要开放式方法来减少研究者偏见并探索意外观点。

Method: 提出基于自由文本的开放式模拟方法，借鉴调查方法学和NLP最新进展，强调捕捉话题、观点和推理过程的完整性。

Result: 开放式设计能改善测量和设计，支持未预期观点的探索，减少指令偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，利用而非限制LLM的生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Conclusion: 单纯的模型规模和架构改进不能确保更好的分类准确性，协调集成多个模型比单纯扩大规模更有效，可能达到或超越人类专家在大规模文本分类中的表现。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

TL;DR: 提出了ProofGrader，一种用于评估大语言模型生成的数学证明的细粒度评分系统，在ProofBench数据集上达到0.926的MAE，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学推理方面主要关注易验证的最终答案，但生成和验证自然语言数学证明仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器。

Method: 提出系统化方法开发验证评估器，使用ProofBench数据集（145个问题，435个LLM生成解决方案），探索评估器设计空间，结合强推理骨干模型、参考解决方案和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926的MAE，在最佳n选择任务中，当n=16时平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader在细粒度数学证明评估方面表现出色，有潜力推动下游证明生成的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择上过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的指令数据选择和标注指导方法。

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内在/外在难度评分，优先选择高级认知指令，提供可解释和可量化的标准用于高效SFT。

Result: 仅用5%数据训练的模型超越全数据集训练效果，在垂直领域仅需2%数据即可超越更大数据集训练模型，展现出优异的泛化能力和领域适应潜力。

Conclusion: THTB为指令数据选择和标注指导提供了有效解决方案，显著降低训练成本的同时提升模型性能，在领域适应方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

TL;DR: 本文通过结构化红队挑战开发了包含50种越狱策略的全面分层分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了分类法指导的自动检测方法，并创建了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且依赖有限的分类法，无法充分捕捉攻击策略的多样性或过于强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战，开发了包含7个家族（冒充、说服、权限提升、认知过载、混淆、目标冲突、数据投毒）的50种越狱策略分层分类法，并收集分析挑战数据。

Result: 创建了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了分类法指导的自动检测效果，并构建了意大利语多轮对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对越狱技术有效性的理解，提供了关于特定越狱策略如何利用模型漏洞和导致错位的见解，并为改进自动检测和传统安全措施提供了新资源。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种作者归属方法：固定风格嵌入和指令调优的LLM判断器（GPT-4o），在包含6个领域的人类AI平行语料库上进行测试，发现两种方法在不同文本类型中各有优势，表明作者归属需要混合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的文本。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o作为LLM判断器，在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集上进行测试，该数据集包含6个领域的600个平衡实例，每个实例包含人类提示、黄金延续和LLM生成的延续。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT延续上表现更好（82% vs 68%），LLM判断器在LLaMA延续上略优（85% vs 81%），但统计不显著。LLM判断器在小说和学术散文中显著优于嵌入，而嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同文本类型中具有互补优势，LLM判断器具有语义敏感性，而嵌入在结构特征上更强。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Motivation: 研究窄域微调如何影响LLM激活，以及这些偏见如何反映微调领域的信息，为AI安全和可解释性研究提供见解。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，分析随机文本前几个token的激活差异，并将这些差异添加到模型激活中进行引导生成。创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 在多种架构和规模的模型上验证了偏见的存在，这些偏见反映了过拟合现象。将预训练数据混入微调语料可大幅消除这些偏见。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在其激活中包含训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要意义，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型的越狱攻击框架，通过优化连续嵌入空间中的对抗后缀，在保持流畅性的同时诱导受限内容输出，比现有方法更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异，但容易受到越狱攻击绕过安全机制。需要系统性地探测这些弱点，理解模型的漏洞。

Method: RAID将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)拒绝感知正则化器引导激活远离拒绝方向，(iii)连贯性项保持语义合理性。优化后通过批判引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID比现有白盒和黑盒基线方法获得更高的攻击成功率，且查询次数更少、计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型在道德和政治立场上的潜在偏见，通过道德基础理论直接比较LLM响应与人类研究数据，评估LLM是否表现出意识形态倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域作为建议提供者，了解其在政治和道德领域的响应偏见变得尤为重要。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM的固有响应、明确政治意识形态表示以及基于人口统计的角色扮演响应，系统比较LLM输出与人类研究数据。

Result: 研究发现LLM在响应中确实表现出特定的意识形态倾向，无论是固有响应还是角色扮演场景下，都存在政治和人口统计依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM在道德和政治响应中存在系统性偏见，这对其在关键应用中的可靠性提出了重要问题，需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏明确的知识检索和抽象层级的迁移模块，受认知科学中模式理论的启发，认为人类通过激活已有心智框架来理解新信息。

Method: 从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤及其关系的抽象模式，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型缺乏隐式形成和使用基于模式的学习表示的能力，但通过显式的基于模式的支架能显著提升性能，在GPQA化学和物理问题上性能提升最高达36.19%。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新路径，同时减少了对演示数量的依赖并增强了可解释性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法大多依赖带标注的验证数据，但在实践中收集高质量标注成本高昂且耗时，需要开发无需标注的提示优化方法。

Method: PDO框架结合了Double Thompson Sampling（优先选择信息量大的提示比较）和Top-Performer Guided Mutation（通过变异高性能提示扩展候选池），可在无标注设置下运行，也可整合部分标注来减轻法官噪声。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO始终优于基线方法，消融研究进一步验证了D-TS和提示变异的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一个无需标注数据的有效提示优化解决方案，通过利用LLM法官的偏好反馈，在样本效率上表现出色，为实际应用中的提示优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，但缺乏对模型内部算术计算结构的理解。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析模型内部表示。

Result: 中间计算出现在残差流中（特别是在MLP块之后），模型在线性编码每个运算符的优先级，并引入了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Conclusion: LLaMA 3.2-3B模型在内部表示中编码了运算符优先级，这为理解语言模型的算术计算机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识失真和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are

TL;DR: 提出了RAGCap-Bench基准，用于细粒度评估代理式RAG工作流中的中间任务能力，发现具有更强中间能力表现的模型能获得更好的端到端结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理式RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时仍存在困难，且其中间推理能力研究不足，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 通过分析先进系统的输出识别常见任务和核心能力，构建典型LLM错误分类法，设计针对性评估问题来创建RAGCap-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明，具有更强RAGCap性能的"慢思考"模型能获得更好的端到端结果，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强中间能力对提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估和改进这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将AI辩论应用于主观问题，发现语言模型倾向于迎合法官立场而非坚持自身先验信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时更具说服力，但矛盾的是，与先验信念不一致的论据在成对比较中被评为更高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了主观维度：撒谎还需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究旨在测试语言模型是否会采用迎合策略来最大化说服力，还是忠于其先验信念。

Method: 在辩论前明确测量语言模型的先验信念，然后让辩手选择偏好立场，并面对故意与其先验信念冲突的法官角色。比较了顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估了模型在捍卫与先验信念一致和相反立场时的说服力和论据质量。

Result: 模型倾向于捍卫与法官角色一致的立场而非其先验信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时更具说服力；但与先验信念不一致的论据在成对比较中被评为更高质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果可以帮助人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的人机交互重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双管齐下的数据合成管道，通过逐步增加任务复杂度直到前沿基线网络代理失败来生成问答对，从而训练更有效的网络代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理在处理复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为语言模型通常未针对长视野推理和探索进行优化。现有方法缺乏对难度和质量的精细控制，且难以评估数据本身的有效性。

Method: 使用基线网络代理在数据合成中扮演多重角色：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤。采用基于强网络代理蒸馏的受控训练设置来评估合成方法。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集较小，但在多个基于网络的基准测试中，我们的数据集能够训练出比现有数据集更有效的网络代理，工具使用动作的多样性是现有方法的两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量的训练数据，使模型在避免重复工具调用行为的同时实现更强的性能，证明了数据合成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前研究中认为可读性（如儿童导向语料）对小语言模型生成连贯文本能力至关重要的解释，质疑将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法。

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较小语言模型在简化语言和复杂成人语言上的训练表现，分析统计简单性（n-gram多样性）与学习能力的关系。

Result: 模型在复杂成人文本上的训练表现与简化语言相当，甚至发展连贯性的速度更快；统计简单性比可读性更能预测学习能力。

Conclusion: 应避免将语言模型训练过度拟人化，需要更精确地理解真正支持小模型能力涌现的属性，统计简单性比可读性更重要。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学元素的准确属性数据对材料设计和制造至关重要，但许多属性难以直接测量。传统数值分析方法无法建模复杂关系，而现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成化学元素的通用嵌入(Global)和属性突出向量(Local)，并设计了基于自注意力的测试时训练方法来缓解预测误差。

Result: 该方法能够有效表示化学元素，支持自然科学研究，特别是在处理文本分布差异和数据稀疏性方面表现出优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路，Element2Vec方法在元素属性预测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在TTS中的使用效果不佳，简单的多数投票有时反而优于标准PRM选择方法，需要找到更有效利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 开发理论框架来优化结合LLM和PRM信号，提出加权聚合策略，并通过预计算方法校准权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，该校准方法显著提升了TTS效率，仅使用21.3%的计算量就超越了普通加权多数投票的性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算量更能获得性能提升，为PRM在TTS中的有效使用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在成本高、推理能力弱、效率低、隐私泄露等问题，需要一种更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用代理工作流，生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的离线模板，可跨多个共享相同模式的表格重用。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: FACTS为现实世界查询导向表格摘要提供了一个实用的解决方案，具有快速、准确和隐私合规的优势。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Motivation: 生物医学查询需要深入理解专业知识并整合多源信息，但大语言模型生成的生物医学内容缺乏科学严谨性，经常虚构蛋白质功能和结构细节，无法访问权威数据库。

Method: 提出BioMedSearch框架，集成文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤来生成高质量问答结果。

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集（3000个问题）上测试，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch通过多源信息检索框架有效解决了大语言模型在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，并增加"黑暗特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM性能的因果影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型认知能力衰退。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量）进行控制实验，在4个LLM上进行持续预训练比较。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2），长文本理解能力下降（RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3），并增加黑暗特质。剂量-反应关系显示认知衰退随垃圾数据比例增加而加剧。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，需要将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并为部署的LLM建立常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，需要在临床部署前制定公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

Result: 在MedQA上提升9.4%，MMLU法律上提升7.9%，MathQA上提升5.1%，简洁指令效果更好

Conclusion: 指令检索为小语言模型提供了有效的推理增强方法，性能提升程度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

Result: 上下文提示的AI文本被专家强烈否定，但经过作者特定微调的AI文本在风格保真度和写作质量上均优于专家写作，且很少被AI检测器识别。

Conclusion: 作者特定微调使AI能生成读者更偏好的非逐字作品，成本降低99.7%，为版权法的"对潜在市场影响"公平使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

### [161] [Less is More: Improving LLM Reasoning with Minimal Test-Time Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13940)
*Zhen Yang,Mingyang Zhang,Feng Chen,Ganggui Ding,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTI框架，通过仅在不确定位置应用选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示指导，以最小开销提升推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有一小部分高熵标记显著影响输出正确性，而现有方法往往以效率为代价进行测试时扩展。

Method: MTI包括：选择性CFG干预（仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导）和轻量级负提示指导（重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码）。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，如Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI是一种无需训练的方法，能以最小开销有效提升大语言模型的推理性能，证明了局部化干预的有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了检索增强生成(RAG)系统中错误类型的新分类法，包括错误示例和实用建议，并创建了带错误类型标注的数据集，开发了自动评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因，理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出新的错误类型分类法，收集带标注的错误RAG响应数据集，开发与分类法对齐的自动评估方法。

Result: 创建了包含错误类型分类、示例数据集和自动评估工具的综合框架，代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了实用工具和分类框架，有助于提升RAG系统的部署稳健性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: German Commons是迄今为止最大的开放许可德语文本集合，包含1545.6亿个token，涵盖法律、科学、文化等7个领域，解决了德语开放训练数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数数据许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，开放许可文本仍然极其稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，建立全面的处理流程，包括质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。所有子集至少采用CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可证。

Result: 构建了包含1545.6亿个token的高质量德语文本语料库，涵盖7个领域，为德语语言模型训练提供了合法的开放数据资源。

Conclusion: German Commons填补了德语开放预训练数据的关键空白，支持真正开放的德语语言模型开发，并发布了可复现和可扩展的语料构建代码。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

### [164] [CRaFT: An Explanation-Based Framework for Evaluating Cultural Reasoning in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14014)
*Shehenaz Hossain,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在跨文化语境中的推理能力，通过四个可解释指标（文化流利度、偏差、一致性和语言适应性）来分析模型解释而非仅看答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确回答不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLM在跨文化语境中的推理能力，而不仅仅是答案准确性。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR）在50个来自世界价值观调查的文化基础问题上的表现，这些问题被翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，分析了超过2100个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流利度，孟加拉语增强流利度，西班牙语基本稳定。GPT在语言间适应性更强但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLM的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现的。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出GlobalGroup任务，评估大语言模型在跨语言抽象推理任务中的表现，发现英语模态通常表现更好，开源和闭源模型之间存在性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估依赖策略或知识的推理任务，而抽象推理在日常生活中有重要作用，但跨语言抽象推理中的语言偏见研究较少。

Method: 提出基于纽约时报Connections游戏的GlobalGroup任务，构建包含英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语的游戏基准，并设计游戏难度测量方法。

Result: 实验发现英语模态在抽象推理任务中表现更好，开源和闭源模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 需要更多研究来理解和解决大语言模型在跨语言抽象推理中的语言偏见问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言通常被认为是任意的，但在许多具体案例中观察到语音和语义之间的系统性关系。本研究旨在通过大规模定量调查探索这些系统性关系的程度，包括先前已识别和未识别的现象。

Method: 采用分布方法，在6种不同语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中分析语素语音相似性和语义相似性空间的对齐情况，使用一套统计测量方法。

Result: 发现了文献中先前未识别的一系列可解释的语音语义对齐模式，以及跨语言模式。对5种先前假设的语音语义对齐进行了分析，发现对某些对齐有支持，对其他对齐结果不一。

Conclusion: 研究表明在大规模定量分析中可以发现语音语义象似性的系统性模式，包括新的对齐模式和跨语言一致性，为语言中语音和语义关系的系统性提供了证据。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

TL;DR: ERGO方法通过监测LLM内部熵值变化来动态调整对话上下文，解决多轮对话中性能下降问题，显著提升模型表现和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中当信息逐步呈现时会出现显著性能下降，这限制了其在实际应用中的可用性

Method: 引入ERGO方法，通过香农熵量化下一个token分布的内部不确定性，当检测到熵值急剧上升时触发自适应提示整合

Result: 在逐步揭示指令的多轮任务中，ERGO相比标准基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值性能提升24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提高对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，结合通用语义编码器和领域自适应编码器，通过轻量级分支分类器和单一校准阈值实现开集意图检测，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测超出范围(OOS)的用户话语是任务导向对话系统和开集意图识别的关键挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块。

Method: 使用双编码器框架：通用句子编码器(USE)用于广泛语义泛化，领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)用于领域特定上下文区分；融合表示通过轻量级分支分类器处理，使用单一校准阈值分离域内和OOS意图；结合合成和开放域异常增强来改进边界学习。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线方法，已知意图的宏F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示与简单校准可以产生鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测，适用于神经对话系统。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令遵循能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望利用强化学习框架来更好地利用SFT数据集，改进基础模型的指令遵循能力

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数

Result: RLSR在指令遵循基准测试中表现优于SFT：Qwen-7B模型上RLSR的AlpacaEval胜率为26.34%，SFT为21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率

Conclusion: RLSR可以有效替代或与SFT结合使用，显著提升模型在指令遵循和下游任务上的性能

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件而受损，这些配置文件缺乏与目标个体的对齐验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并优化角色配置文件来减少这些差异。

Result: 在四种不同行为预测场景中评估，DPRF能持续显著提高行为对齐度，优于基线角色配置，且在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置提供了稳健方法，增强了用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI等下游应用的有效性。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段化离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出，在保持精度的同时实现高达1.70倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然提升了小语言模型的推理能力，但带来了延迟增加的问题。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）难以平衡效率和精度，面临阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成两大挑战

Method: 提出LiteStage框架：1）阶段化离线搜索分配最优层预算；2）基于置信度的在线生成早期退出机制抑制不必要解码

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍加速，精度损失小于4.0%，优于现有无需训练的层跳过方法

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的延迟问题，通过智能层跳过和早期退出机制，在保持推理精度的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对同一提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，需要提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签，以及表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器向共识对齐。

Result: 在11个数据集上评估，平均提高观察一致性11.62%，平均F1分数提高8.94%，跨格式性能方差减少3.29%。在域外评估中也能有效泛化。

Conclusion: F²C是一种有效的无监督方法，可增强LLM在提示扰动下的鲁棒性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

*Jihao Zhao,Zhiyuan Ji,Simin Niu,Hanyu Wang,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转为主动理解，通过模拟人类认知过程提取文档记忆，提升小语言模型的知识内化和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式仅理解相关文本块，限制了知识内化深度和推理能力，需要模拟人类阅读的认知过程来改进。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；引入逆向推理策略训练小语言模型；开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，并使SLMs能够实现以人为本的智能文本处理。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取和人类认知模拟，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，为小语言模型实现智能文本处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

*Rahul Nadkarni,Yanai Elazar,Hila Gonen,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实验方法来研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系，通过干预数据批次来测试数据与行为之间的假设关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练数据如何影响语言模型的行为表现，特别是事实知识获取方面的能力。

Method: 通过干预数据批次（"重写历史"）的方法，包括从基准中选择评估项、匹配相关文档、修改文档，然后重新训练模型并测量效果。

Result: 结果表明共现统计和现有方法无法完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验框架，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DEG-RAG框架，通过实体解析和三元组反思来净化LLM生成的知识图谱，解决图基RAG系统中知识图谱噪声问题，显著提升问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基RAG系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但会产生包含冗余实体和不可靠关系的噪声图谱，这降低了检索和生成性能并增加计算成本。当前研究未全面解决LLM生成知识图谱的去噪问题。

Method: DEG-RAG框架包含：(1) 实体解析：消除冗余实体；(2) 三元组反思：移除错误关系。同时系统评估了实体解析的不同策略，包括分块策略、嵌入选择、相似度度量和实体合并技术。

Result: 该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，而且在多种流行的图基RAG变体上持续提升问答性能。这是首次对LLM生成知识图谱中实体解析的全面探索。

Conclusion: DEG-RAG通过简单的去噪方法有效解决了LLM生成知识图谱的噪声问题，生成更紧凑、更高质量的知识图谱，显著优于未处理的对应系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现不佳，但通过优化训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，可以显著提升性能。开发了一个约300M参数的紧凑多语言模型，其检索性能达到甚至超过当前7B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现落后于大型模型的问题，探索能否通过特定优化使小型模型在检索任务中表现更好。

Method: 研究训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型效果的影响，重点分析硬负样本的作用以及任务多样性vs语言多样性的重要性。

Result: 增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，硬负样本对提升检索准确率至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。开发的300M模型在检索性能上媲美甚至超越7B模型。

Conclusion: 小型多语言模型可以通过精心设计的训练策略（特别是硬负样本和任务多样性）在检索任务中达到与大型模型相当的性能，这为开发高效紧凑的多语言检索模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: Qwen3Guard是一个多语言安全护栏模型系列，包含生成式和流式两个变体，支持细粒度三分类判断和实时安全监控，在多种语言基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式LLM推理不兼容。

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含生成式变体（将安全分类转为指令跟随任务）和流式变体（引入token级分类头进行实时监控），提供三种参数规模并支持119种语言。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的智能检索系统，通过三个专门代理（问题分析器、选择器和添加器）的迭代交互，在多跳问答任务中实现高精度和高召回率的证据检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，传统检索方法在复杂问题中难以同时保证精度和召回率，因此需要更智能的检索系统。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题选择最相关上下文（关注精度），添加器补充缺失证据（关注召回率），通过选择器和添加器的迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的支持段落。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue和MultiHopRAG四个多跳问答基准测试中，该方法持续优于强基线，在过滤干扰内容的同时实现更高的检索准确率。

Conclusion: 该智能检索系统能够显著减少下游问答模型对无关信息的依赖，同时超越全上下文答案的准确率，为多跳问答任务提供了有效的检索解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架：表优先检索后列选择，列优先检索后表选择，并结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取等技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等基准测试中显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，将完整模式与完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，无需查询优化即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 论文关键概念路径的分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，所提出的方法能有效提升学术论文分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Result: 发现LLM在不同语言间进行一致且可解释的数学推理存在持续缺陷，在低资源语言环境下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 多语言数学推理仍是LLM的挑战领域，需要更全面的评估和改进方法。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，并开发了多轮强化学习方法来减少模型的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在与用户交互时可能产生欺骗性输出，无论是故意还是无意的，这带来了严重的安全风险。模型行为的不确定性、对幻觉和错误信息的防护不足，使其误用成为现实风险。

Method: 提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种现有欺骗检测指标和提出的新指标。引入了多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断更相关。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，当被提示欺骗时，欺骗性可增加31%。使用RLHF训练的安全模型仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法使欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，需要超越单轮分析。提出的多轮强化学习方法能有效减少LLMs的欺骗行为，对确保AI安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为大规模AD筛查工具和医生辅助检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在多版本角色扮演中的表现，包含30个英雄和90个特定版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在忠实、一致地扮演版本特定角色方面的能力，特别是针对超级英雄在不同宇宙中的多版本表现。

Method: 构建包含Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境）两个任务的基准测试，采用Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能改善较弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低较强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少同时擅长两者。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

*Ziad Elshaer,Essam A. Rashed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的多模型框架，无需微调即可提升医疗问答性能，通过置信度检测和自适应路由机制实现模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA达到95.0%，MedMCQA达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的方法，对资源受限环境中的医疗AI民主化具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs对结构化字符级扰动的抵抗力，探索在在线考试系统等场景中防止LLM滥用的方法。

Method: 提出NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，破坏分词并降低信噪比，通过模型、问题和噪声相关配置进行综合评估。

Result: 尽管存在强混淆效果，许多LLM仍保持显著性能，揭示了LLMs在字符级噪声处理中的鲁棒性机制。

Conclusion: LLMs的低级鲁棒性研究揭示了其滥用的风险，对LLM在各种应用中部署的可靠性提出了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Motivation: 为美国6800万非英语母语人群提供准确、及时、文化相关的天气信息，实现"天气准备国家"目标，改善风险沟通。

Method: 与LILT合作，利用其专利训练过程使大型语言模型适应天气术语和消息传递，结合GIS地图识别语言需求，并整合伦理AI实践。

Result: 开发了可扩展的自动翻译系统，显著减少人工翻译时间，减轻操作负担，创建了包含警告、7天预报和教育活动的多语言网站。

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PluriHop问题概念，针对需要聚合所有文档的问答任务，开发了PluriHopWIND数据集和PluriHopRAG方法，在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要聚合所有文档的重复性报告数据（如医疗记录、合规文件）时表现不佳，存在检索停止点不明确和对遗漏文档高度敏感的问题。

Method: 提出PluriHopRAG架构：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤器在昂贵LLM推理前丢弃无关文档，实现"逐个检查所有文档，廉价过滤"的方法。

Result: 传统RAG方法在PluriHopWIND数据集上F1得分不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG相对提升了18-52%的F1得分，证明了详尽检索和早期过滤的价值。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集揭示了当前问答系统在重复性、干扰文档丰富的语料上的局限性，PluriHopRAG的性能突出了详尽检索和早期过滤作为top-k方法替代方案的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单条社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但忽视了用户通过历史帖子和互动评论随时间展现意图的重要性。

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，采用基于哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表(C-SSRS)的四标签标注框架，并结合大语言模型进行实验分析。

Result: 统计分析和LLM实验结果表明，纳入评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个token预测方面表现出色，但在生成反映个人真实沟通风格(如回复邮件或社交消息)的响应方面仍有困难，且真实的社交网络或邮件历史由于隐私问题难以收集。

Method: 构建基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC，让用户与之进行为期五天的互动，收集多语言对话数据，评估基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了一个包含英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话的多语言基准数据集，捕捉了自然的日常沟通模式，并能够分析用户的内部模型。

Conclusion: 为YNTP任务建立了首个基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响回答可靠性。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) 引用感知推理，要求所有内容基于检索文档；2) 迭代检索验证，通过验证代理评估证据充分性；3) MedTrust-Align模块，结合验证样本和反幻觉样本进行优化。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med数据集上，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效增强了生物医学问答的事实一致性，显著减少了幻觉，为医疗AI系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用标签自由的自监督强化学习框架，引入约束分解策略和高效的约束级二元分类，直接从指令中推导奖励信号并生成伪标签。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决多约束指令跟随问题，具有良好的泛化能力，无需依赖外部监督。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的Web代理训练数据，通过主动在线探索收集证据，然后自演化聚合程序生成可验证的QA对，创建了包含10K样本的WebAggregatorQA数据集，并基于此开发了WebAggregator模型系列，在信息聚合能力上超越了GPT-4.1等现有模型。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的开源深度研究代理主要关注增强信息检索能力，但忽视了信息聚合这一关键需求，这限制了它们支持深度研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：1）主动在线探索从真实网络收集证据；2）自演化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对；3）基于SmolAgents框架收集监督微调轨迹。

Result: 构建了WebAggregatorQA数据集（10K样本，50K网站，11个领域）；WebAggregator-8B模型性能与GPT-4.1相当，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet；在专门的信息聚合评估基准上，现有模型表现不佳（Claude-3.7-sonnet仅28%，GPT-4.1仅25.8%）。

Conclusion: Web代理需要加强信息聚合能力，即使能够检索到所有参考资料，在信息聚合任务上仍然表现不佳，凸显了提升Web代理基础模型信息聚合能力的必要性。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Motivation: 解决编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，使用自然语言输出替代JSON格式

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT框架显著改善工具调用性能，对强化学习和监督微调阶段的模型训练有重要影响，且能扩展不支持原生工具调用的模型能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间，结合检索和推理增强，提升跨语言表示在低资源条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚点对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头，通过一致性正则化增强跨语言理解、检索和推理鲁棒性。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，在少样本和噪声放大设置下均显示出持续增益和鲁棒性，消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR的贡献。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示质量，同时增强了检索和推理能力，为低资源语言处理提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法高效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级标记，丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来改进seq2seq模型在增量设置中的效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指解析器中丢弃大部分标记是在增量共指消解中的可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs两个关键问题的框架和数据集：(1)模型与用户社会文化背景的契合度；(2)是否在保持安全性和技术鲁棒性的同时不暴露用户于潜在危害。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥有意义作用，但并不总能很好地服务目标用户，且追求未经检验的主张可能导致低估安全性等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面、有根据且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但在移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降。论文提出WritingPreferenceBench数据集，显示序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，而生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链达到81.8%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好（如创造力、风格、情感共鸣），需要开发能更好理解主观偏好的方法。

Method: 构建WritingPreferenceBench数据集（1800个人工标注偏好对），比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率52.7%，零-shot模型53.9%，生成式奖励模型81.8%。不同写作类别间模型性能差异大（18.2%-81.8%），模型规模对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：现有数据缺乏复杂内部模式，以及当前方法仅使用简单提示-响应对而没有提供精确的思考过程或难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq合成后训练数据集，将数字序列打包为算法问题来发现通项公式。通过反思失败测试案例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，并采用基于可解性和自生成案例成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Conclusion: CodeSeq方法有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，通过自主案例生成和自我检查机制，使模型能够从成功和失败中更有效地学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，使用强化学习结合AI反馈机制，通过ASR和LLM分别评估语义准确性和韵律情感对齐，以提升情感语音合成的表现力和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本转语音方法在情感表达方面存在不足，通常依赖昂贵的情感标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用强化学习从AI反馈机制，结合自动语音识别评估语义准确性，以及大语言模型评估韵律情感标签对齐，从结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度优化表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上的实验表明，RLAIF-SPA优于Chat-TTS，词错误率降低26.1%，SIM-O指标提高9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架通过直接优化情感表达和语义准确性，显著提升了情感语音合成的质量和自然度。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，通过多标签分类实现聚类，无需预先知道聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖商业LLM，成本高且透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量，这在现实场景中往往不可行。

Method: 让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于同一聚类的文本会共享更多标签的假设，通过嵌入编码计算相似度。

Result: 在四个基准测试集上，该方法达到了与现有基线相当或更好的效果，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在基于大语言模型的检索重排序任务中的表现，发现SFT在权重更新方面显著优于CL，从而在整体性能上取得优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的检索重排序方法存在目标函数选择的分歧：传统BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM更适合监督微调。需要探究哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序及其内在机制。

Method: 将CL和SFT目标分解为权重和方向两个组件，建立统一分析框架。在通用多模态检索(UMR)平台上进行对比实验，并通过大规模训练验证发现。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重更新方案，而评分方向没有明显优劣。SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，在MRB基准测试中创造了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 监督微调(SFT)在基于大语言模型的检索重排序中优于对比学习(CL)，主要归因于其更强的权重更新机制。这一发现为未来相关研究和应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM的奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励对表达变化敏感且不适用于长文本任务，生成式奖励虽然更鲁棒但在动态语料库中设计可验证且稳定的奖励仍然困难且计算成本高。

Method: 提出“nugget-as-rubric”范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；设计基于查询重写的自动准则构建流程；开发4B参数的Search-Gen-V生成验证器，采用蒸馏思想和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验结果显示Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载下实现了强大的验证准确性，成为搜索增强LLM的可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构造器。

Conclusion: nugget-as-rubric范式为搜索增强LLM提供了一种统一且可验证的奖励构造方法，Search-Gen-V验证器在准确性和效率方面表现出色，解决了现有奖励建模的局限性。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的大规模基准测试，收集4200多个经过验证的提示，评估17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计基于编码器的缓解策略。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在使用方言词时性能下降32.26%至48.17%，提出的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%），同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著挑战，但通过专门的缓解策略可以显著改善方言性能而不损害标准英语性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种方法教机器翻译模型理解语义韵律，特别是中文"被"字句的负面语义韵律，通过微调多个MT模型在英中翻译任务中取得了改进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是通过语言单位与共现搭配形成的搭配意义，与语义意义不同。当前机器翻译模型无法处理语义韵律问题，导致翻译不准确。

Method: 创建包含中文"被"字句负面语义韵律的英中句子对数据集，然后对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调，用于英中翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的MT模型在翻译不利内容时能更好地使用"被"字句，而对中性和有利内容则避免使用。在NLLB-600M中，这种语义韵律知识还能从英中翻译迁移到其他语言对如西中翻译。

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和微调，可以有效提升机器翻译模型对语义韵律的处理能力，且这种知识在多语言模型中具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和访问不平等等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解参与。

Method: 开发了基于用户故事生成和多智能体讨论的人类中心框架，在用户研究中让参与者阅读故事并进行讨论。

Result: 阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事叙述帮助参与者推测更广泛的AI危害和收益，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过自动量规构建和过程监督，有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和推理质量。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成的硬件设计效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个问题，每个问题配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog代码在功能正确性和综合效率方面的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在功能正确性方面达到78.3%（pass@1），但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%（eff@1），远低于专家手工实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究发展，因为仅关注功能正确性不足以评估硬件设计的实际质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在创意写作中的系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的问题。

Method: 构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向提示、创作推理过程和最终文本。通过实验分析创意写作的两组件模型。

Result: 发现过程监督非常有效但需要通用数据稳定，创意能力具有文化特异性且无跨语言迁移，词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑脚手架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Answer Regeneration的框架，通过额外模型推理来提升推理模型评估的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型评估方法对答案提取算法高度敏感，导致评估结果不稳定。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，将原始输入输出前加上"Answer:"提示，从再生输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型评估提供了更可靠的结果，且与提取规则无关。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据、在线的测试时适应框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署时由于分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：在预填充阶段和定期间隔中，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；然后正常生成文本，保持修改后的路由器直到下一次适应。通过轻量级加法向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。例如在HumanEval上获得5.5%提升，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需数据、即插即用的测试时适应方案，能有效改进MoE模型的路由决策，且与现有测试时扩展技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练表现更好且遗忘更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多语言模型采用"中期训练"阶段（在预训练结束时混合高质量指令格式数据），但这种实践缺乏科学理解，需要系统研究其有效性和机制。

Method: 通过从头开始预训练语言模型并在不同领域监督微调数据集上进行受控实验，分析中期训练的效果。对中期训练开始时间和数据混合权重进行消融研究，以代码中期训练为案例。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能持续优于持续预训练，在领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘方面表现更好。时机比混合权重更重要，较早引入专业数据能带来更大收益。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘实现更好性能，特别是在语法差距较大的领域。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR的编译器栈，专门为AMD NPU等空间架构设计，通过AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，实现高效的计算编排和数据移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的性能，需要提供显式机制来编排计算和数据以充分利用这些架构。

Method: 引入MLIR-AIR编译器栈，定义AIR方言提供结构化表示，支持异步和分层操作，通过编译器管理调度实现空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；多头注意力仅需约150行代码即可实现融合实现。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为空间程序，有效利用NPU的计算结构和内存层次，通过异步执行、分块和通信重叠实现高效映射。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失和分层模型融合的新方法，显著提升了RAG系统中LLM输出的一致性，相比基线提升了约47.5%的响应相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在语义等价输入下常产生不一致输出，而现有的一致性训练数据稀缺且微调技术在提升输出一致性方面存在局限。

Method: 结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的一致性感知权重的分层模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，相比基线实现了约47.5%的响应相似度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的缩放定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用，需要新的框架来理解训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用

Method: 提出一个简单可解释的框架，联合建模下游性能与训练计算量和提供上下文的关系，在Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B的扩展上下文变体上进行实证验证

Result: 框架准确建模分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算量上具有良好泛化性，并能可靠外推上下文增加时的性能

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了有价值的指导，揭示了训练计算量与上下文利用之间的相互作用

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的有效性，使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据，对抑郁、焦虑和PTSD进行诊断。模型在各类诊断中达到80%以上准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球主要致残原因，但抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD常因主观评估、临床资源有限、污名化和认知不足而被误诊。初级保健中超过60%的病例被误判，急需可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据，评估多种模型类别：GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用LoRA微调的RoBERTa模型。发现较短、聚焦的语境片段能提高召回率。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到超过80%的准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（最高89%准确率和98%召回率）。LoRA微调证明高效且有效，低秩配置（如秩8和16）在各项评估指标中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具能提供显著改进，为低门槛、AI驱动的早期诊断铺平道路。这项工作为将机器学习整合到现实世界临床工作流程奠定了基础，特别是在资源匮乏或污名化严重、及时心理健康护理获取最受限的环境中。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提升模型推理性能，还赋予其显著的自奖励能力，从而增强推理时扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过简单的最后一词自奖励机制，以最小额外成本实现了高效的推理和自验证联合优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM智能体训练通常依赖最终答案的结果奖励，这种奖励稀疏性在多轮交互中会导致优势崩溃和信用分配困难的问题。

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取真实答案信息的增量过程，定义轮级奖励为策略产生正确答案概率的边际增长，直接从模型自身信念更新中推导内在奖励。

Conclusion: IGPO通过信息增益提供密集的内在监督，有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升了强化学习训练效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化真实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程角度上都极其昂贵。

Method: 集成数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，使用引导展开过程进行连贯探索，并通过轨迹包装器产生高质量多样化轨迹。还提出了UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，优先处理高影响力任务并合成信息丰富的轨迹变体。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式有潜力持续高效地增强数字代理能力。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、架构无关的策略，通过自适应地决定何时刷新（基于注意力感知的漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（基于深度感知的调度），减少扩散大语言模型中KV缓存的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和层中为所有令牌重新计算QKV，尽管KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层中，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK令牌主要作为长度偏置，可以在活动预测窗口之外进行块级缓存；(2) KV动态随深度增加，从更深层开始选择性刷新足够；(3) 最受关注令牌的KV漂移最小，为其他令牌提供保守的缓存变化下界。提出Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定刷新时机和位置。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上的实验显示：GSM8K（256令牌）加速8.7倍，长序列加速45.1倍，HumanEval加速4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上实现6.8倍吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，显著减少冗余计算，加速扩散LLM的解码，同时保持生成质量，实现实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: 需要采用治理优先的范式来解决LLM代理工程中的根本性范式不匹配问题。

Abstract: The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an ``Age
of the Agent,'' enabling autonomous systems to tackle complex goals. However,
the transition from prototype to production is hindered by a pervasive ``crisis
of craft,'' resulting in agents that are brittle, unpredictable, and ultimately
untrustworthy in mission-critical applications. This paper argues this crisis
stems from a fundamental paradigm mismatch -- attempting to command inherently
probabilistic processors with the deterministic mental models of traditional
software engineering. To solve this crisis, we introduce a governance-first
paradigm for principled agent engineering, embodied in a formal architecture we
call ArbiterOS.

TL;DR: MT-Sec是首个系统评估多轮编码场景中正确性和安全性的基准测试，通过将单轮任务转换为语义对齐的多轮交互序列来构建。评估发现从单轮到多轮设置中"正确且安全"的输出下降20-27%，即使是最先进模型也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI编程助手基准测试主要评估单轮任务的正确性和安全性，无法反映真实世界开发的迭代性质。需要系统评估多轮编码场景中的正确性和安全性。

Method: 使用合成数据管道将现有单轮任务转换为语义对齐的多轮交互序列，重用原始测试套件同时模拟真实世界编码过程的复杂性。评估了32个开源和闭源模型以及三种智能体框架。

Result: 从单轮到多轮设置中"正确且安全"的输出下降20-27%；在多轮代码差异生成任务中表现更差，功能不正确和不安全输出率增加；智能体框架在单轮代码生成中表现更好，但在多轮评估中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 需要能够联合评估多轮真实世界编码工作流程中正确性和安全性的基准测试，当前模型在多轮交互场景中表现显著下降。

Abstract: AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed
software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing
benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they
are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative
nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to
systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding
scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms
existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction
sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity
of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models,
and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in
"correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even
among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate
models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically
relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased
rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that
while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they
are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings
highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and
security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A11yn是首个将代码生成LLM对齐以可靠生成符合可访问性标准的网页UI的方法，通过优化基于WCAG违规的奖励函数，将不可访问率降低了60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在生成网页界面时经常复制训练数据中的可访问性缺陷，导致界面无法满足多样化用户需求。

Method: A11yn优化了一个新颖的奖励函数，该函数根据可访问性测试引擎识别的违规严重程度对WCAG违规进行惩罚，并使用UIReq-6.8K数据集进行训练。

Result: A11yn显著优于基线方法，将不可访问率比基础模型降低了60%，同时保持了生成UI的语义保真度和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明可访问性可以在LLM中系统优化，证明了为可访问性对齐代码生成的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating functional and aesthetic web interfaces directly from
instructions. However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from
their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse
needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method
that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant
web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the
severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To
support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse
instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300,
a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated
from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results
show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the
Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic
fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that
accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the
feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.

TL;DR: 重新评估基于谱签名防御方法在代码模型后门攻击检测中的适用性，发现传统设置效果不佳，提出新的代理指标来更准确评估防御性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在软件开发中的广泛应用，后门攻击成为重要威胁。谱签名防御方法在代码模型中的有效性尚未得到充分验证，需要系统评估其适用性

Method: 系统评估谱签名防御在不同攻击场景和防御配置下的有效性，分析关键因素设置的影响，探索新的代理指标

Result: 发现代码后门检测中广泛使用的谱签名设置通常不是最优的，找到了一个无需防御后重新训练模型就能更准确估计谱签名实际性能的新代理指标

Conclusion: 谱签名防御在代码模型后门检测中需要优化配置，提出的新代理指标能够有效评估防御性能，为代码模型安全提供改进方向

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks.
Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to
manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data.
Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the
use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by
analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works
have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks,
recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for
code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral
Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We
systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and
defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found
that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection
is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the
key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate
the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the
defense.

TL;DR: BugStone是一个基于LLVM和大型语言模型的程序分析系统，能够利用已修复的bug实例识别代码中重复出现的错误模式，从而发现更多潜在的类似bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型程序中存在大量重复出现的bug模式，这些bug虽然部分已被修复，但其他相似代码段中可能仍存在相同问题。手动查找和修复这些重复bug非常耗时，且bug报告可能扩大攻击面。

Method: 利用LLVM和大型语言模型分析程序，通过已修复的bug实例识别一致的错误模式（如特定API误用），然后在整个程序中搜索相似代码段来发现潜在漏洞。

Result: 从135个独特RPB开始，BugStone在Linux内核中识别了超过22K个新潜在问题。手动分析400个发现确认246个有效。在包含1.9K安全bug的数据集上达到92.2%精确度和79.1%成对准确度。

Conclusion: RPB在软件程序中普遍存在且严重影响安全性。BugStone通过利用已修复bug实例的模式识别，能够高效发现大量未被发现的类似bug，显著提高软件安全性。

Abstract: Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial
time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project
maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the
issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,
which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and
fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more
concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they
provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other
parts of the program.
  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear
repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different
programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our
investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise
the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program
analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key
observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged
to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By
examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify
similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,
BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.
Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also
created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier
conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring
patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice,
BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.

TL;DR: NL2Scenic是一个用于评估自然语言到Scenic代码生成的数据集和框架，包含146个NL/Scenic对和30个测试用例，评估了13个模型并提出了EDIT-COMP作为可靠评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Scenic DSL中自然语言到代码生成的稀缺数据、有限可重现性和不一致度量问题。

Method: 构建NL2Scenic数据集，包含Example Retriever和14种提示变体，评估13个模型（4个专有和9个开源），使用文本和执行指标，并与专家研究比较。

Result: EDIT-SIM与人类判断相关性最好，GPT-4o表现最佳，Qwen2.5Coder-14B达到GPT-4o专家评分的88%，检索增强提示提升小模型性能。

Conclusion: NL2Scenic和EDIT-COMP为Scenic代码生成提供了标准化评估基础，表明中等规模开源模型是自动驾驶场景编程的实用且经济高效的选择。

Abstract: Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic,
a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible
scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs)
suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We
introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a
difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14
prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four
proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine
open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using
text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics
(compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11).
EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of
EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking
fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88
percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting,
Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and
scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder
outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a
standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and
indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options
for autonomous-driving scenario programming.

TL;DR: Caruca是一个自动为不透明命令挖掘规范的系统，通过使用大语言模型将文档翻译为结构化调用语法，探索命令执行空间，提取关键属性如并行性和文件系统条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统需要手动创建命令规范，这个过程繁琐且容易出错，限制了系统的实用性。

Method: 使用大语言模型将命令文档翻译为结构化调用语法，探索语法有效的命令调用和执行环境，通过系统调用和文件系统拦截提取命令属性。

Result: 在60个GNU Coreutils、POSIX和第三方命令上测试，Caruca为除一个案例外的所有情况生成了正确规范，完全消除了手动工作。

Conclusion: Caruca能够自动生成可立即使用的命令规范，为依赖规范的系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: A wealth of state-of-the-art systems demonstrate impressive improvements in
performance, security, and reliability on programs composed of opaque
components, such as Unix shell commands. To reason about commands, these
systems require partial specifications. However, creating such specifications
is a manual, laborious, and error-prone process, limiting the practicality of
these systems. This paper presents Caruca, a system for automatic specification
mining for opaque commands. To overcome the challenge of language diversity
across commands, Caruca first instruments a large language model to translate a
command's user-facing documentation into a structured invocation syntax. Using
this representation, Caruca explores the space of syntactically valid command
invocations and execution environments. Caruca concretely executes each
command-environment pair, interposing at the system-call and filesystem level
to extract key command properties such as parallelizability and filesystem pre-
and post-conditions. These properties can be exported in multiple specification
formats and are immediately usable by existing systems. Applying Caruca across
60 GNU Coreutils, POSIX, and third-party commands across several
specification-dependent systems shows that Caruca generates correct
specifications for all but one case, completely eliminating manual effort from
the process and currently powering the full specifications for a
state-of-the-art static analysis tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合知识引导进化框架，通过离线构建编译知识库和在线使用知识增强的遗传算法，自动调优编译器优化序列，相比-Oz基准平均额外减少11.0%的LLVM IR指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编译器优化标志（如-O3、-Oz）采用一刀切方法，无法充分发挥程序的性能潜力。编译器优化序列自动调优是一个NP难问题，需要更智能的方法。

Method: 混合知识引导进化框架：离线阶段构建包含四个组件的编译知识库（Pass行为向量、Pass组、协同Pass图、原型Pass序列）；在线阶段使用知识增强的遗传算法进行语义感知重组和定向修复突变。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上，相比高度优化的opt -Oz基准，平均额外减少11.0%的LLVM IR指令，展现了在发现个性化高性能优化序列方面的最先进能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合离线知识提取和在线进化搜索，有效解决了编译器优化序列自动调优问题，显著提升了程序性能优化效果。

Abstract: Compiler pass auto-tuning is critical for enhancing software performance, yet
finding the optimal pass sequence for a specific program is an NP-hard problem.
Traditional, general-purpose optimization flags like -O3 and -Oz adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to unlock a program's full
performance potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid,
Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework. This framework intelligently guides
online, personalized optimization using knowledge extracted from a large-scale
offline analysis phase. During the offline stage, we construct a comprehensive
compilation knowledge base composed of four key components: (1) Pass Behavioral
Vectors to quantitatively capture the effectiveness of each optimization; (2)
Pass Groups derived from clustering these vectors based on behavior similarity;
(3) a Synergy Pass Graph to model beneficial sequential interactions; and (4) a
library of Prototype Pass Sequences evolved for distinct program types. In the
online stage, a bespoke genetic algorithm leverages this rich knowledge base
through specially designed, knowledge-infused genetic operators. These
operators transform the search by performing semantically-aware recombination
and targeted, restorative mutations. On a suite of seven public datasets, our
framework achieves an average of 11.0% additional LLVM IR instruction reduction
over the highly-optimized opt -Oz baseline, demonstrating its state-of-the-art
capability in discovering personalized, high-performance optimization
sequences.

TL;DR: 本文首次对在线编程中的TLE错误进行大规模实证研究，开发了首个专门针对TLE错误的自动修复工具Nettle及其评估框架Nettle-Eval。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线编程平台上的TLE错误难以解决，错误信息缺乏诊断价值，平台支持有限，现有调试工具帮助不大，导致许多用户在重复TLE失败后放弃提交。

Method: 手动分析1000个Codeforces的TLE提交，分类根本原因，追踪用户修复尝试。开发Nettle工具，将LLM与编译器生成的针对性自动反馈和测试用例相结合。

Result: 分析显示TLE错误不仅源于低效算法，还包括无限循环、不当数据结构使用和低效I/O。Nettle在1000个真实案例中达到98.5%的修复率，远超最强LLM基线。

Conclusion: TLE错误不仅仅是性能问题，Nettle工具能有效自动修复TLE错误，所有修复都通过了Nettle-Eval和平台官方检查器的验证。

Abstract: Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions
of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry
interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)
error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although
designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error
messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and
existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon
their submissions after repeated TLE failures.
  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in
online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE
errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix
them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient
algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and
inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely
performance issues.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair
tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework
for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback
generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code
edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same
1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the
strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the
platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR方法由于难以生成精确的规范，面临生成过多合理补丁候选和过拟合部分测试用例的挑战。

Method: PathFix通过四个步骤工作：1)追踪错误路径；2)分析期望路径；3)生成和评估补丁；4)验证补丁正确性。还集成LLM来提升修复性能和缓解可扩展性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明PathFix优于现有解决方案，特别是在处理复杂程序结构（如循环和递归）方面表现突出。

Conclusion: PathFix通过路径敏感约束和LLM集成，有效解决了APR中的关键挑战，在复杂程序修复方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable
defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness.
However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing
APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch
candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages
path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate
patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy
program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the
fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First,
it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second,
it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the
control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads
to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by
solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the
correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and
mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate
a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that
PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex
program structures such as loops and recursion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试生成方法依赖静态数据集，存在固定难度上限，无法发现训练范围之外的新颖或更复杂的bug，限制了LLM生成代码的可靠性提升。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，让测试生成器与对抗性代码生成器相互竞争，测试生成器通过RL优化同时最大化输出准确率和攻击成功率，学习逐步增强的策略。

Result: 实验表明ATGen显著优于现有最先进方法，能作为更有效的Best-of-N推理过滤器和更高质量的代码生成模型训练奖励源。

Conclusion: ATGen建立了一种新的动态范式，从根本上提高了LLM生成代码的可靠性，突破了静态训练的固定难度限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs
often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical
bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or
supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a
``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover
novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we
introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial
reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code
generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy.
This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging
current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to
learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling
of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical
utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N
inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation
models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the
reliability of LLM-generated code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 对20个最先进的LLM代理在自动化Web漏洞复现方面进行了首次全面评估，发现虽然LLM代理在简单库漏洞上表现合理，但在需要多组件环境的复杂服务漏洞上持续失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在软件工程和网络安全任务中展现出显著能力，但自动化Web漏洞复现这一关键应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统评估LLM代理在真实Web漏洞复现场景中的能力。

Method: 系统评估了来自软件工程、网络安全和通用领域的20个代理，涵盖16个维度，包括技术能力、环境适应性和用户体验因素。在3个代表性Web漏洞上测试后，选择3个表现最佳的代理在包含80个真实CVE的基准数据集上进行深入评估。

Result: LLM代理在简单库漏洞上达到合理成功率，但在复杂服务漏洞上持续失败。复杂环境配置和认证障碍导致代理能执行利用代码但无法触发实际漏洞。对输入指导高度敏感，认证信息不完整时性能下降超过33%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理能力与可靠自动化漏洞复现需求之间存在显著差距，需要在环境适应和自主问题解决能力方面取得进展。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in software engineering and cybersecurity tasks, including code generation,
vulnerability discovery, and automated testing. One critical but underexplored
application is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms
vulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest
promising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web
vulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web
vulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software
engineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including
technical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors,
on 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three
top-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation
on our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types
and 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve
reasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently
fail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component
environments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers
create a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual
vulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with
performance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.
Our findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent
capabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,
emphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous
problem-solving capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出一种基于名称预测的内聚性度量方法，通过量化源代码中的内聚性破坏来检测恶意代码注入，在极端不平衡测试集上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链攻击通过合法项目中注入恶意代码严重威胁软件安全，这类攻击罕见但破坏性大，自动检测需要理解代码意图和上下文，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 使用基于名称预测的内聚性(NPC)度量，分析恶意代码引入时函数内聚性变化，并与自然波动对比，研究54,707个函数和369个C++开源仓库。

Result: 代码注入会降低内聚性，使命名模式转向更短、描述性更差的名称。在1:1,000不平衡比下Precision@100达36.41%，1:10,000时达12.47%。

Conclusion: 自动化内聚性测量，特别是基于名称预测的内聚性度量，有助于识别供应链攻击，提高源代码完整性。

Abstract: Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious
code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may
have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated
tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of
both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an
unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying
cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion
(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is
introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707
functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection
reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive
names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of
real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme
test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC
can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100
of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that
automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based
cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving
source code integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为ISA迁移的主要挑战是二进制翻译，但现代开源生态系统使得重新编译成为可能，这带来了新的多层面挑战。

Method: 通过分析Google从x86到Arm的大规模迁移（涉及近40,000个代码提交），建立了ISA迁移任务分类法，展示了自动化方法和AI的应用。

Result: 确定了ISA迁移中的各种任务类型，展示了Google如何自动化这些步骤，并证明了AI在自动解决这些任务中的重要作用。

Conclusion: 现代ISA迁移面临与二进制翻译不同的新挑战，AI在自动化迁移过程中发挥关键作用，但仍有一些挑战性任务需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Migrating codebases from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another is
a major engineering challenge. A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in
addition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has
seen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on
static and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom
has been that this is the primary challenge.
  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations
can often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to
recompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and
multifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.
  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning
almost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA
migration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and
demonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these
tasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research
challenges that warrant further attention.

Conclusion: 所提出的混合算法在RIS辅助定位中表现出色，能够有效处理离散RIS元件并仅需最小反馈信息。

Abstract: This paper studies user localization aided by a Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS). A feedback link from the Base Station (BS) to the user is
adopted to enable dynamic power control of the user pilot transmissions in the
uplink. A novel multi-agent algorithm for the joint control of the RIS phase
configuration and the user transmit power is presented, which is based on a
hybrid approach integrating NeuroEvolution (NE) and supervised learning. The
proposed scheme requires only single-bit feedback messages for the uplink power
control, supports RIS elements with discrete responses, and is numerically
shown to outperform fingerprinting, deep reinforcement learning baselines and
backpropagation-based position estimators.

Abstract: This research proposes an extensive technique for monitoring and controlling
the industrial parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on
wireless communication. We proposed a system based on NRF transceivers to
establish a strong Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), enabling transfer of
real-time data from multiple sensors to a central setup that is driven by
ARDUINO microcontrollers. Different key parameters, crucial for industrial
setup such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and fire detection, are
monitored and displayed on an LCD screen, enabling factory administration to
oversee the industrial operations remotely over the internet. Our proposed
system bypasses the need for physical presence for monitoring by addressing the
shortcomings of conventional wired communication systems. Other than
monitoring, there is an additional feature to remotely control these parameters
by controlling the speed of DC motors through online commands. Given the rising
incidence of industrial fires over the worldwide between 2020 and 2024 due to
an array of hazards, this system with dual functionality boosts the overall
operational efficiency and safety. This overall integration of IoT and Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN) reduces the potential risks linked with physical
monitoring, providing rapid responses in emergency scenarios, including the
activation of firefighting equipment. The results show that innovations in
wireless communication perform an integral part in industrial process
automation and safety, paving the way to more intelligent and responsive
operating environments. Overall, this study highlights the potential for change
of IoT-enabled systems to revolutionize monitoring and control in a variety of
industrial applications, resulting in increased productivity and safety.

Conclusion: 采用原则性、通用协议对于实现分布式AI潜力至关重要，特别是在6G及以后复杂实时应用中。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the field of LLM agents requires a unified,
telecom-inspired communication protocol to ensure safety, interoperability, and
scalability, especially within the context of Next Generation (NextG) networks.
Current ad-hoc communication methods are creating a fragmented ecosystem,
reminiscent of the early "protocol wars" in networking, which stifles
innovation and poses significant risks. Drawing inspiration from the layered,
standardized protocols that underpin modern telecommunications, we propose the
LLM-Agent Communication Protocol (LACP). LACP establishes a three-layer
architecture designed to ensure semantic clarity in communication,
transactional integrity for complex tasks, and robust, built-in security. In
this position paper, we argue that adopting a principled, universal protocol is
not merely beneficial but essential for realizing the potential of distributed
AI. Such a standard is critical for ensuring that multi-agent systems can
operate safely and reliably in the complex, real-time applications envisioned
for 6G and beyond.

TL;DR: DiffLoc框架使用条件生成扩散模型直接从大规模MIMO信道状态信息实现高精度室外用户定位，在东京城市宏小区环境中达到亚厘米级精度，比现有方法提升一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指纹定位方法难以扩展到大型动态室外环境，需要密集且不切实际的数据调查。需要克服这些限制，直接从原始上行链路SRS指纹学习到连续地理坐标的映射。

Method: 应用条件生成扩散模型处理高维大规模MIMO CSI，采用一致性训练方法将推理步骤从200步减少到仅2步。

Result: DiffLoc-CT模型在融合精度上达到0.5厘米，单基站精度达到1-2厘米，比监督回归方法（误差超过10米）和基于网格的融合方法（3米误差）有数量级提升。

Conclusion: 该框架即使对于高速用户（15-25米/秒）和未见过的用户轨迹也能保持优异精度，证明了其在实时6G应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for high-accuracy outdoor user
equipment (UE) positioning that applies a conditional generative diffusion
model directly to high-dimensional massive MIMO channel state information
(CSI). Traditional fingerprinting methods struggle to scale to large, dynamic
outdoor environments and require dense, impractical data surveys. To overcome
these limitations, our approach learns a direct mapping from raw uplink
Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) fingerprints to continuous geographic
coordinates. We demonstrate that our DiffLoc framework achieves unprecedented
sub-centimeter precision, with our best model (DiffLoc-CT) delivering 0.5 cm
fusion accuracy and 1-2 cm single base station (BS) accuracy in a realistic,
ray-traced Tokyo urban macro-cell environment. This represents an
order-of-magnitude improvement over existing methods, including supervised
regression approaches (over 10 m error) and grid-based fusion (3 m error). Our
consistency training approach reduces inference time from 200 steps to just 2
steps while maintaining exceptional accuracy even for high-speed users (15-25
m/s) and unseen user trajectories, demonstrating the practical feasibility of
our framework for real-time 6G applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中基站解耦和新服务对RAN配置提出挑战，需要在满足带宽和延迟约束的同时降低能耗，因为RAN运营占运营商OPEX的主要部分。

Method: 使用混合整数线性规划模型，包含三个目标函数：最小化前传延迟、最小化能耗、以及平衡延迟和能耗的双目标优化。还提出了启发式算法来处理MILP计算时间长的问题。

Result: 揭示了延迟和能耗之间的权衡关系，强调了动态RAN重配置的必要性。评估涵盖了不同拓扑、gNB需求变化、功能分割组合和TSN建模。

Conclusion: 为优化现有和未来RAN部署提供了基础，展示了在现实场景中平衡延迟和能耗的重要性。

Abstract: In 5G networks, base station (BS) disaggregation and new services present
challenges in radio access network (RAN) configuration, particularly in meeting
their bandwidth and latency constraints. The BS disaggregation is enabled by
functional splitting (FS), which distributes the RAN functions in processing
nodes and alleviates latency and bandwidth requirements in the fronthaul (FH).
Besides network performance, energy consumption is a critical concern for
mobile network operators (MNO), since RAN operation constitutes a major portion
of their operational expenses (OPEX). RAN configuration optimization is
essential to balance service performance with cost-effective energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) model formulated with three objective functions: (i) minimizing
fronthaul (FH) latency, (ii) minimizing energy consumption, and (iii) a
bi-objective optimization that jointly balances both latency and energy
consumption. The model determines the optimal FS option, RAN function
placement, and routing for eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Although prior studies
have addressed RAN configuration either from an energy minimization or latency
reduction perspective, few have considered both aspects in realistic scenarios.
Our evaluation spans different topologies, accounts for variations in
aggregated gNB demand, explores diverse FS combinations, and incorporates Time
Sensitive Networking (TSN) modeling for latency analysis, as it is also crucial
in RAN performance. Given that MILP's execution time can be significant, we
propose a heuristic algorithm that adheres to RAN constraints. Our results
reveal a trade-off between latency and energy consumption, highlighting the
need for dynamic RAN reconfiguration. These insights provide a foundation to
optimize existing and future RAN deployments.

Conclusion: 证明了LLMs在大规模协议建模中的有效性，为自动协议状态机提取提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile telecommunication networks are foundational to global infrastructure
and increasingly support critical sectors such as manufacturing,
transportation, and healthcare. The security and reliability of these networks
are essential, yet depend heavily on accurate modeling of underlying protocols
through state machines. While most prior work constructs such models manually
from 3GPP specifications, this process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and
difficult to maintain due to the complexity and frequent updates of the
specifications. Recent efforts using natural language processing have shown
promise, but remain limited in handling the scale and intricacy of cellular
protocols. In this work, we propose SpecGPT, a novel framework that leverages
large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract protocol state machines
from 3GPP documents. SpecGPT segments technical specifications into meaningful
paragraphs, applies domain-informed prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning,
and employs ensemble methods to enhance output reliability. We evaluate SpecGPT
on three representative 5G protocols (NAS, NGAP, and PFCP) using manually
annotated ground truth, and show that it outperforms existing approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs for protocol modeling at scale.

<details>

Motivation: 现有信息科学中的指标存在固有偏见，需要开发新的方法来量化研究的颠覆性和概念新颖性。

Method: 使用top2vec生成文档和主题的n维嵌入，通过持久同调识别嵌入分布中的空洞，然后用mixup条形码确定哪些空洞被未观察到的出版物填充。

Result: 研究了负嵌入空间代表缺失背景（较旧研究）与创新空间（较新研究）的程度，以及占据这些空间的文档如何整合边缘研究主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化研究创新提供了新的度量指标，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Recent work in the information sciences, especially informetrics and
scientometrics, has made substantial contributions to the development of new
metrics that eschew the intrinsic biases of citation metrics. This work has
tended to employ either network scientific (topological) approaches to
quantifying the disruptiveness of peer-reviewed research, or topic modeling
approaches to quantifying conceptual novelty. We propose a combination of these
approaches, investigating the prospect of topological data analysis (TDA),
specifically persistent homology and mixup barcodes, as a means of
understanding the negative space among document embeddings generated by topic
models. Using top2vec, we embed documents and topics in n-dimensional space, we
use persistent homology to identify holes in the embedding distribution, and
then use mixup barcodes to determine which holes are being filled by a set of
unobserved publications. In this case, the unobserved publications represent
research that was published before or after the data used to train top2vec. We
investigate the extent that negative embedding space represents missing context
(older research) versus innovation space (newer research), and the extend that
the documents that occupy this space represents integrations of the research
topics on the periphery. Potential applications for this metric are discussed.

Motivation: 许多有自杀意念的社交媒体用户不会明确表达痛苦，而是通过日常发帖或同伴互动间接流露信号，早期检测这些隐性信号至关重要但具有挑战性。

Method: 采用复合网络中心性度量识别用户的顶级邻居，时间对齐用户和邻居的互动，在微调的DeBERTa-v3模型中整合多层信号。

Result: 在Reddit的1000名用户研究中，该方法比仅基于个人信息的基线提高了15%的早期隐性自杀意念检测准确率。

Conclusion: 同伴互动提供了有价值的预测信号，对设计能够捕捉在线环境中间接和隐蔽风险表达的早期检测系统具有更广泛的意义。

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型有效性验证方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分，特别是在指导决策过程时模型有效性至关重要。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型与高保真模型的决策一致性来确定模型有效性，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，验证了DOTechnique能够有效发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术通过决策者上下文支持发现模型有效性，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Result: 与基线模型相比，在所有词汇上实现了约34%的相对词错误率降低，在领域特定术语上实现了35%的相对词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 集成演示文稿幻灯片等视觉信息可以显著提升ASR系统在科学演示场景下的性能，特别是在领域特定术语识别方面。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在因果推理任务中容易产生因果幻觉，即使在没有足够证据支持的情况下也会错误地推断因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中发展出因果幻觉，这种认知偏见被认为是许多社会问题的根源。

Method: 构建了1000个医学背景下的零列联场景数据集，在这些场景中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对在需要准确因果推理的领域使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero是一个用于部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDPs)的动作中心图表示框架，通过图神经网络学习专家演示的价值函数和策略，实现跨问题规模的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在通过统一的基于图的信念表示，实现在领域内跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和解码器架构从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后将学习到的启发式方法应用于更大问题的蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示框架成功实现了POMDP规划中的跨规模泛化，为可扩展的POMDP求解提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种替代性监管方法：要求大型AI实验室发布小型开源模拟模型，这些模型是从其最大专有模型中蒸馏训练而来的缩小版本，既能确保AI安全又能促进创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保安全又不阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型开源模拟模型，这些模型作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作。

Result: 小型模拟模型上开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效推广到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进展。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法成本最小，利用可重用资源，同时为公共利益做出重大贡献，通过加深对模型的理解来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者的双赢。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于多目标马尔可夫决策过程的共识声明生成框架，通过社会选择理论提供公平性保证，包括基于比例公平的随机生成策略和基于平等福利的搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏可证明公平性的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时提供公平性保证。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、词元级马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个智能体的偏好。提出两种基于社会选择理论的方法：一是保证处于事前核心的随机生成策略，二是基于平等福利目标的搜索算法。

Result: 实验表明，基于平等福利目标的搜索方法生成的共识声明在智能体对齐的最坏情况下优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了具有可证明公平性保证的正式结构，能够有效改善最坏情况下的智能体对齐效果。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

TL;DR: 提出STEMS框架，一种安全约束的多智能体强化学习方法，用于协调建筑能源管理，显著降低能耗成本、碳排放和安全违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统中空间-时间依赖关系利用不足、缺乏严格安全保障和系统复杂性三大挑战。

Method: 结合空间-时间图表示学习(GCN-Transformer融合架构)和安全约束多智能体强化学习(集成控制屏障函数)。

Result: 在真实数据集上实现21%成本降低、18%排放降低，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，舒适度保持最佳(仅0.13不适比例)。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在多建筑能源管理中表现出卓越性能、强鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体间通信协议碎片化，导致语义鸿沟，无法进行严格的系统属性分析，存在架构错位和可利用的协调问题风险。

Method: 构建了两个基础模型：主机智能体模型（处理用户交互、任务分解和协调）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务状态转换），并用时序逻辑定义31个属性。

Result: 创建了第一个严格基础的、领域无关的框架，用于系统分析、设计和部署正确、可靠、鲁棒的智能体AI系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI智能体系统的行为推理提供了统一的语义基础，能够进行形式化验证、检测协调边界情况和预防死锁与安全漏洞。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产地退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境应力与材料退化间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 基于PerceiverIO的轻量多模态架构，采用简化编码器(64D潜在空间)防止小数据集过拟合，使用自适应Barlow Twins损失鼓励模态互补性。

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法(传感器61.5%，图像46.2%)显著提升。

Conclusion: 架构简化与对比正则化结合可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中训练RL代理，将RL模型与行为树联合训练，在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中创建多任务NPC。

Result: 证明了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，展示了各种技能的联合训练效果。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交集是一个值得进一步探索的关键节点，这种结合方法为游戏AI的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接和上下文对话来实时触发临床订单检索，无需LLM重写，减少了延迟和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话包含显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定性和不透明性，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 使用PubMedBERT初始化的双编码器，通过对比学习目标对齐异质意图表达，训练时使用约束LLM指导将签名订单与不同表述形式关联。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开源嵌入模型，查询无关模式对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将上下文对话链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。需要一种自动化的、组合式的奖励设计方法来简化RL目标规范。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器；为每个自动机状态关联语言嵌入以实现跨任务泛化；利用奖励机器的结构化形式进行有效任务分解。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，包括展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM框架成功地将基础模型的高层推理能力与奖励机器的结构化形式相结合，为强化学习的自动化奖励设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常在多轮交互中展开，需要评估LLM代理在多轮交互中的安全漏洞。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）以及混合评估框架的基准测试系统。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash两种模型进行测试。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升至99.33%（Gemini）。最常见的毒性行为是侮辱（84.9-87.8%）和谩骂（81.2-85.1%）。封闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，强调了开发强大安全防护措施的必要性，以保持在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

*Jiayu Wang,Yifei Ming,Riya Dulepet,Qinglin Chen,Austin Xu,Zixuan Ke,Frederic Sala,Aws Albarghouthi,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LiveResearchBench基准和DeepEval评估套件，用于系统评估深度研究代理系统在实时网络搜索和综合信息生成方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估深度研究系统的能力，往往聚焦于狭窄领域或提出模糊问题，难以进行公平比较。需要遵循用户中心、动态性、明确性和多面性搜索密集型四个原则来构建更有效的评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含100个专家策划任务的LiveResearchBench基准，涵盖日常生活、企业和学术领域，每个任务都需要广泛的动态实时网络搜索和综合。同时开发了DeepEval评估套件，包含内容和报告级别的质量评估，整合了四种互补的评估协议。

Result: 对17个前沿深度研究系统进行了全面评估，包括单代理网络搜索、单代理深度研究和多代理系统。分析揭示了当前系统的优势、常见失败模式以及推进可靠深度研究所需的关键系统组件。

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为系统评估深度研究能力提供了严格基础，识别了当前系统的局限性和改进方向，为开发更可靠的深度研究系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

### [268] [Towards Agentic Self-Learning LLMs in Search Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14253)
*Wangtao Sun,Xiang Cheng,Jialin Fan,Yao Xu,Xing Yu,Shizhu He,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic Self-Learning (ASL)框架，通过多角色协同进化的强化学习实现无需人工标注数据的智能体自我学习，发现生成式奖励模型和大量任务数据是提升智能体能力的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，通过自我学习来扩展基于LLM的智能体能力。

Method: 提出ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型，在共享工具环境和LLM骨干网络中形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环强化学习系统。

Result: ASL实现了持续的性能提升，超越了会停滞或退化的RLVR基线方法，在零标注数据条件下仍能持续改进，表现出优异的样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键杠杆，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展、自我改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试范围有限，缺乏根据模型推理能力进化调整难度的灵活性，需要更全面有效的评估方法。

Method: 从现有基准和奥赛级竞赛中收集复杂推理问题，利用模型推理过程中的关键陈述自适应修改问题分析难度，并使用仿真软件生成可动态调整难度的问题。

Result: 收集了1300多个测试问题，基于o3和GPT-5等模型的推理能力迭代调整了MorphoBench的难度。

Conclusion: MorphoBench提高了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为改进大模型的推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

### [270] [A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301)
*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护LLM安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和抗有害空空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在微调过程中即使使用良性数据或低秩适配，预训练的安全行为也容易退化，导致微调模型产生有害响应。

Method: 使用协方差预条件奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，从安全无关组件初始化低秩适配器并冻结安全相关组件；构建空空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的安全输出。

Result: 在多个预训练模型和下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于在GSM8K上微调的Llama-2-7B-Chat，GuardSpace将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，同时准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能有效保护LLM在微调过程中的安全对齐，在保持安全性的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Terrarium框架，用于研究基于LLM的多智能体系统中的安全、隐私和安全问题，通过重新设计黑板架构创建模块化测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化复杂任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意攻击和数据窃取，需要系统化研究这些安全问题。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现三个协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，能够快速原型化、评估和迭代防御措施，展示了框架在多种攻击场景下的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的研究进展，为安全、隐私和安全问题提供系统化研究工具。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，为多智能体系统提供实时、无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正，通过历史条件异常评分来防止错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱：单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；集成到不同多智能体框架中，在各种架构上均获得一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，为多智能体系统提供了有效的错误检测和纠正机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了AI4Service新范式，通过Alpha-Service框架实现主动式AI助手，能够从第一视角视频流中检测服务机会并提供个性化服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务多为被动响应，需要用户明确指令。真正智能的助手应能预见用户需求并在适当时机主动采取行动。

Method: 基于冯·诺依曼计算机架构，在AI眼镜上构建五组件系统：输入单元（感知）、中央处理单元（任务调度）、算术逻辑单元（工具使用）、内存单元（长期个性化）和输出单元（人机交互）。

Result: 通过多智能体系统实现，案例研究包括实时21点顾问、博物馆导游和购物搭配助手，展示了无缝环境感知、用户意图推断和及时有用的协助能力。

Conclusion: Alpha-Service框架成功实现了主动式AI服务，能够在不需明确提示的情况下提供及时有用的帮助，为AI从被动工具向主动伴侣的转变提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IP-Merging方法，无需调优即可让多模态大语言模型直接从数学推理LLM中吸收数学推理能力，通过识别关键推理层和参数空间对齐来解决模型融合中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学推理能力上落后于纯文本LLM，但现有方法主要关注数据标注和训练范式，缺乏直接利用现成数学LLM能力的方法。

Method: IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间中保持对齐；3）在子空间中合并参数。这是一个无需调优的直接参数调整方法。

Result: 大量实验表明，IP-Merging方法能有效增强MLLMs的数学推理能力，且不会损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging提供了一种无需调优的方法，成功让多模态大语言模型直接从数学LLM中吸收数学推理能力，解决了参数空间对齐问题。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态-动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划能力，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构，将多步决策重构为单步子目标序列，引入前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，解决长时程任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于基于提示、监督学习和强化学习的先前方法；在ScreenSpot-v2上展示零样本泛化能力；在AndroidWorld基准上显示良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent的分层设计和联合优化方法有效解决了移动设备控制中的泛化问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色，展示了在复杂移动控制场景中的强大适应性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中的局限性，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: IMAGINE框架通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型进行训练。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，训练后的模型达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的结构化推理和规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了性能并降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将PDDL公理中负出现的派生谓词消除的转换方法，证明这种限制实际上不会影响表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中负出现的谓词必须是由动作直接设置的，而不能是公理派生的。但文献中作者经常偏离这一限制，只要求公理集是可分层的。本文旨在证明这两种变体实际上表达能力相同。

Method: 提出了一种转换方法，能够消除公理体中负出现的派生谓词，将受限制的PDDL公理转换为等价形式。

Result: 证明了两种变体（标准限制和可分层的）可以表达完全相同的查询，即最小不动点逻辑所能表达的所有查询。

Conclusion: PDDL标准对负出现的派生谓词的限制实际上不会影响其表达能力，因为可以通过转换方法消除这些负出现。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Motivation: 联邦学习在去中心化数据训练模型方面具有强大潜力，但设计和部署稳健系统的复杂性阻碍了其发展，需要自动化解决方案来克服数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战。

Method: Helmsman采用三阶段协作方法：1)交互式人机协同规划制定研究计划；2)监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成；3)在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环流程。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法生成的解决方案与已建立的手工基准相竞争，且往往更优。同时引入了AgentFL-Bench基准，包含16个多样化任务来评估FL中智能体系统的系统级生成能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步，Helmsman系统能够有效解决联邦学习系统设计的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

TL;DR: 本文对神经符号AI中的推理捷径问题进行了系统概述，分析了其成因、后果，并总结了现有的应对方法，旨在帮助研究人员更好地理解和解决这一挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI模型在缺乏概念监督时容易出现推理捷径问题，即模型通过错误地表示概念来达到高标签准确率，这会损害模型的可解释性、分布外性能以及可靠性。由于相关文献分散，研究人员难以全面理解和应对这一问题。

Result: 通过将高级材料重新表述为易于理解的形式，本文为推理捷径问题提供了统一视角，降低了研究人员解决这一问题的入门门槛。

Conclusion: 本文有助于促进可靠神经符号AI和可信赖AI模型的发展，通过系统梳理推理捷径问题及其解决方案，为研究人员提供了实用的指导和参考。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了预训练LLM代理能否通过自我生成任务、积累知识和环境交互，成为具有自主规划能力的开放实体。实验表明代理能执行复杂指令、跨运行存储信息并自主提出任务，但仍存在提示设计敏感、任务重复和缺乏自我表征等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM代理能否超越智能问题解决工具，成为能够自主规划、设计任务并为模糊目标进行推理的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境进行广泛交互，然后对结果进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能够可靠地遵循复杂多步骤指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，并自主提出和解决任务，但对提示设计敏感，容易产生重复任务，且无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、进行有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Conclusion: ColorBench能够全面评估移动代理在复杂长时程任务上的能力，支持多有效解评估和原子级分析，为提升代理性能提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别LLM的局限性，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了系统1认知的规模化运作，快速、联想且具有说服力，但缺乏反思或证伪能力。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图vs领土-区分现实表征与现实本身；(ii)直觉vs理性-基于双过程理论区分快速情感判断与缓慢反思思维；(iii)冲突vs确认-检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须受到人类理性的治理。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康差距。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏见风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表等成熟框架，应用于35篇同行评审研究。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据处理记录良好，但大多数研究忽略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析和潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架，为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进而非损害健康公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁情报领域进行清晰的推理，需要一种能够连接自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱的自动化推理框架。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，以及图执行器遍历TITAN本体来检索事实答案和支持证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示TITAN能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的有效连接，为威胁情报分析提供了自动化推理能力。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI伦理方法过于人类中心化，现有伦理模型无法让智能体在不确定环境中发展情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为。

Method: 采用神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，使代理能够评估在不确定环境中的行为伦理后果。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利。

Conclusion: NAEL框架能够克服现有伦理模型的局限，使智能体在不预设人类道德直觉的情况下发展出自适应的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 通过系统改进，成功将理论基础的实用算法配置方法提升到实用水平，为算法配置提供了兼具理论保证和实际性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关的冗余信息，导致合并模型性能下降。现有方法随机丢弃参数缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，进行上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余成分，通过谱秩分配策略进行公平剪枝

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，可应用于各种基于任务向量的合并方法，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构上均有效

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余信息，显著提升模型合并性能，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和移动模式的理解，且无法有效整合季节、天气、节假日等世界知识和用户认知信息。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 在去标识化的用户时空轨迹数据上继续预训练获取推荐知识；2) 通过监督微调和强化学习实现认知对齐，使模型判断与人类偏好一致。

Conclusion: CoAST框架成功解决了LLMs在POI推荐中缺乏地理理解和认知对齐的问题，通过自然语言接口整合多种信息源，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）中的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM模型来评分函数调用的内部步骤，并与细粒度束搜索结合。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 提出SimKO方法解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过非对称设计提升pass@K性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降

Method: 分析训练动态发现概率集中效应，提出SimKO方法：对正确响应提升top-K候选概率，对错误响应惩罚top-1候选

Result: 在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO一致提升了广泛的K值下的pass@K性能

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解过度集中问题有效鼓励探索，为改进RLVR的探索能力提供了简单方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性请求必要信息来减少NL2SQL任务中的元信息处理，显著降低token使用量和处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token数量多、处理成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息，而不是一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表问答任务上的评估显示，token使用量减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过减少元信息处理显著降低了NL2SQL任务的成本，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RoboGPT-R1，一个两阶段微调框架，通过监督训练获取基础知识，再通过强化学习提升视觉空间理解和推理能力，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升具身智能体的推理能力对于完成复杂人类指令至关重要，现有基于监督微调的大模型在长视野操作任务中仍面临常识和推理能力受限的问题。

Method: 两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足，设计了同时考虑长视野性能和动作约束的基于规则的奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练得到的推理模型在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段微调框架有效提升了具身规划能力，通过结合监督学习和强化学习解决了视觉空间理解和多步推理任务中的物理理解和动作序列一致性问题。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

### [294] [Boosting Instruction Following at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14842)
*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2个指令时提升7个百分点，10个指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅仅添加更多指令并不能保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10个指令的数据样本，同时开发定量冲突评分工具。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，并发现性能下降与指令间冲突程度相关，冲突评分工具能解释性能趋势。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率，冲突评分工具为开发者提供了评估额外指令影响的反馈机制。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换；通过单次连续参数加权所有可达路径并求和得到覆盖生成函数；提供可测试的推断并通过多数投票实例进行验证。

Result: 该理论提供了可操作的语言和工具来衡量智能体及其搜索空间，为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述。

Conclusion: 提出的形式理论为LLM辅助的迭代搜索提供了工作语言和操作工具，能够系统地描述和测量基于领域先验指导的搜索过程。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

### [297] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过低保真度潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真度上下文的方法，解决LLM代理的上下文窗口限制和状态失同步问题，提高代理可靠性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态失同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测和资源使用低效，特别是在与代码库和文档等大型结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，要求代理先在低保真度潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真度上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行中介，作为声明式、状态同步的协议。

Result: 通过Sage（Gatekeeper Protocol的参考实现）证明，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI代理提供了基础方法，适用于任何结构化知识领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标注数据或模型更新的强化学习代理，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，迭代改进企业日志的模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要整合大量第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档常常缺失、不匹配或格式混乱，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 使用强化学习代理：1)识别模糊字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种基于证据的透明解决方案，为更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。需要寻找更高效、预算友好的测试时扩展策略。

Method: 采用判别式验证器与自一致性相结合的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行验证，相比纯生成式验证更加高效。

Result: 在固定计算预算下，混合方法显著优于最先进的生成式验证，在AIME2025数据集上准确率提升达15.3%。

Conclusion: 对于实际应用，基于判别式验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是自一致性的"免费"升级，而且是比昂贵生成技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有抑郁症自动检测研究存在范围有限、缺乏系统性特征比较和评估协议不一致的问题，需要系统探索多模态特征表示和建模策略。

Method: 系统评估手工特征与预训练嵌入、不同神经编码器的有效性，比较单模态、双模态和三模态配置，分析融合策略，特别关注EEG的作用，采用一致的受试者独立分割进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础，证明了多模态融合的有效性和预训练特征的优势。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来量化推理系统的过自信问题，并在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中验证该指标与错误校准和幻觉的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制思想与反馈控制理论相结合，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大四个维度；在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，更高的H-Risk预测过自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响复杂。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈的混合奖励机制，在少量数据上实现高质量的过程级推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些挑战源于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注、人类标注成本高、LLM自评估易产生幻觉，以及蒙特卡洛估计中的信用分配问题。

Method: 1. 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2. 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供基于执行的正确性信号；3. 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4. 将奖励信号格式化为理由增强的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万自动标注样本（最佳PRM的10%数据量），在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至优于使用人类标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一条可扩展且可验证的路径，通过树引导和保真度感知的框架有效解决了现有PRM的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Conclusion: 在语言、机器设计和物理推理的交叉领域仍存在挑战，但强化学习为提升LLM的机器创造能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有研究将人工制作和AI生成的虚假内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型，而真实场景中内容类型未知，限制了专门化系统的有效性。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，增强类别感知的MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专门化基线。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够统一处理不同类型虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.
