### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的新方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，并添加LiDAR支持，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试中需要高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致性问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于射线的剔除，设计了分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，相机和深度误差平均减少40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有光栅化方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了自动驾驶测试中多传感器模拟的关键挑战，在保真度和速度方面均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR：通过状态变化学习重构手术未来预测，采用师生架构预测手术视频中的状态转换，在多个数据集上实现跨程序的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件而非预测未来，缺乏统一的方法来同时处理短期和长期预测任务，且现有方法难以在不同手术场景中泛化

Method: 将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，使用师生架构：教师网络学习当前和未来视频片段的状态表示，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，通过Action Dynamics模块引导

Result: 在四个数据集和三种手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序转移验证了方法的泛化能力

Conclusion: 状态变化学习框架为手术未来预测提供了统一的方法，能够有效处理不同时间尺度的预测任务并实现跨程序泛化

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，使用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外图像上性能显著下降，主要原因是疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，训练数据多样性不足导致模型在未见域中脆弱。

Method: 基于度量学习的目标感知度量学习与优先采样框架(TMPS)，利用少量目标域标记样本，通过优先采样策略有效提升模型对目标域的适应性。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每个疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架通过有效利用少量目标域样本，显著提升了植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言对齐增强框架，通过在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有VLM无需文本标签或完整重训练即可生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用，需要解决零标签学习问题。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架ViZer，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需依赖人工或合成标注数据集。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述比基线更接地气和详细。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，能够在不依赖文本标签的情况下提升图像描述质量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专为胎儿超声设计的医疗AI系统，通过引入显性认知解耦(SED)方法，结合专家构建的二部图和强化学习，解决了胎儿超声中的多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图图像推理、疾病种类繁多和图像多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出显性认知解耦(SED)，将专家构建的二部图注入模型以解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择；同时构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线方法，平均提升14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流程引导的SED方法有效解决了胎儿超声领域的特定挑战，为胎儿超声AI系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA和QSilk微粒度稳定器，无需重新训练即可提升图像锐度、提示遵从性和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在采样过程中存在细节丢失、伪影和提示遵从性不足的问题，需要一种无需重新训练的方法来提升图像质量和稳定性。

Method: 使用ZeResFDG模块集成三种技术：频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影；采用轻量级频谱EMA进行模式切换；结合QSilk微粒度稳定器进行推理时稳定化处理。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器上，该方法在中等引导尺度下显著改善了图像锐度、提示遵从性和伪影控制，同时在高分辨率下能生成自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的采样器级引导解决方案，无需模型重新训练即可显著提升扩散模型的图像生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE提出了一种动态选择专用编码器的混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由而非传统的token级路由，在减少计算成本的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多视觉编码器方法简单堆叠编码器会导致收益递减且计算成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择机制。

Method: 使用共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力动态选择最优编码器，并采用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器和1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有参考对象。构建了大规模基准SVAG-Bench和基线框架SVAGFormer，现有模型在该任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 需要在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级的推理。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包括320个提示的数据集和基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，揭示了当前T2V模型在保持多动作序列一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V生成模型在创建视觉吸引人的视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要逻辑进展的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，且现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标，缺乏对扩展序列叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 设计了包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂度，包含2560个人工标注视频；开发了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能高效捕捉长距离依赖和时序排序。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人工标注显示出强相关性；系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的对象状态、多对象场景中的物理不合理结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成），将场景感知能力注入到文本条件运动模型中，利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但缺乏同时处理两者的方案，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同数据集，通过关键帧层调节运动潜在空间，并添加场景条件层通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知能力注入到文本到运动模型中，并进一步分析了这种感知能力出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法实现了场景感知的文本条件运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba，用于心电图异常检测，在PhysioNet挑战赛上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心脏异常检测的准确性。

Method: 使用卷积特征提取结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强心电图数据中时间依赖关系的表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛上，该模型在12导联心电图上的AUPRC和AUROC得分显著高于之前发表的最佳算法。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构有潜力推进可靠的ECG分类，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，成功解耦相机姿态与场景内容，实现了姿态的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新颖视角合成方法的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性，同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的视角合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量实现姿态与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor在可迁移性方面显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关，实现了真正的视角合成能力。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何表示即可实现姿态可迁移性，为自监督新颖视角合成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在训练时使用梯度幅值损失，但去除方向信息会导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不佳，需要保留梯度方向信息来改善融合质量。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留梯度符号，提供清晰的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理保留。

Conclusion: 方向感知的多尺度梯度损失能够有效提升红外与可见光图像融合的质量，无需改变模型架构或训练协议。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医学图像分割的无监督域自适应框架，专门解决MRI海马体分割中的域偏移问题，特别是内容变化，通过结合风格协调和双向可变形图像配准策略，在跨域分割任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于域偏移（包括图像外观的风格变化和人群相关的解剖学特征的内容变化）而表现不佳，特别是在海马体分割任务中。

Method: 结合z-归一化的高效风格协调与双向可变形图像配准策略，配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，以引导感兴趣区域的配准并生成解剖学上合理的变换，将源图像对齐到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在所有实验中均优于现有基线。从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者时，Dice分数相比标准增强方法相对提升高达15%，在内容偏移显著的情况下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨不同人群的准确海马体分割方面表现出高效性，特别适用于处理显著内容偏移的场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了量化扩散概率模型(DPMs)中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，并系统分析了不同采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 研究发现FID等常用评估指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，且常常牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征记忆库(SFM)缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)保持时间一致性，使用SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest提供了一种高效、准确的视频编辑解决方案，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了高质量的时间一致性和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手在社交互动中缺乏干预时机感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时应该作为AI助手进行干预，导致持续且不合时宜的响应，破坏自然对话并影响用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的大规模数据集EgoSocial，并提出EgoSoD方法，通过整合多模态上下文线索到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示现有OLLMs在干预时机检测上表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法在干预时机性能上分别提升Phi-4 45.6%和Gemini 2.5 Pro 9.9%，在社交互动性能上分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法能有效提升AI助手在社交互动中的干预时机检测能力，解决了当前LLMs在社交意识方面的局限性。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类判断对齐的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，基于35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数评估，VPreg在Dice分数、计算变换的规则性、逆映射的准确性和一致性方面优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等最先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg通过变分原理方法在微分同胚图像配准中表现出优越性能，提供了更高质量的配准变换和更精确的逆变换，对计算解剖学和形态计量学具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Result: 在Flickr30K和MS-COCO基准测试中，文本到图像检索提升16.8%，图像到文本检索提升40.1%，建立了语义对齐任务的新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用LLM的开放语义知识和超图适配器，有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了语义对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that

Conclusion: DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的内在物理特性作为先验知识，有效提升了模型在不同地理环境下的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，而EGS明确旨在最大化高斯泼溅质量，现有方法不适用。需要解决评估GS质量函数与获取客户端图像之间的因果困境。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：首先从每个客户端采样图像子集作为导频数据预测损失；基于评估结果优先分配通信资源给更有价值的客户端；使用特征域聚类选择代表性数据，采用传输时间最小化减少导频开销；开发联合客户端选择和功率控制框架，基于惩罚交替主化最小化算法求解非凸问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案有效解决了EGS中的资源分配问题，通过两阶段采样和传输策略，在有限通信资源下最大化高斯泼溅质量，为边缘场景重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

### [27] [MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13208)
*Lianlian Liu,YongKang He,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过分区感知风格注入和分区感知去噪网络，从语音生成具有精细区域风格差异的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法忽略区域运动风格差异和动态适应性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时存在两个主要问题：一是过度简化风格多样性或忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身vs下身），二是未能让运动风格动态适应语音节奏和情绪变化，限制了运动真实感。

Method: MimicParts框架包含分区感知风格注入和分区感知去噪网络。它将身体划分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，并通过分区感知注意力块让节奏和情绪线索精确指导每个身体区域，确保生成的运动与语音节奏和情绪状态的变化保持一致。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在自然度和表现力方面优于现有方法，能够生成更自然的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts通过分区感知的方法成功解决了风格化3D人体运动生成中的区域风格差异和动态适应性问题，显著提升了生成运动的真实感和表现力。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: 本调查论文系统梳理了视觉提示(VP)和视觉提示调优(VPT)方法，提出了统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，并对现有方法进行了分类和总结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被混用，缺乏对这两种技术及其各自应用的系统性区分，需要建立统一的理论框架。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，提出统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，将现有方法分类为可学习、生成式和不可学习提示，并按注入粒度(像素级和标记级)进一步组织。

Result: 建立了PA方法的分类体系，考察了PA在医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等领域的应用，以及在测试时适应和可信AI中的作用，总结了当前基准和挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面调查，为研究人员提供了理解PA相关研究演进路径的清晰路线图。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向工业表面缺陷检测的样本中心多任务学习框架，通过联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，解决了传统像素中心方法在样本级决策稳定性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性、长尾尺度分布和低对比度等挑战，导致现有模型虽然像素重叠指标表现良好，但在样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 采用共享编码器架构的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位。样本级监督调节特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升对小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的召回率，而分割分支保留边界和形状细节以增强样本级决策稳定性。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估套件有效解决了工业表面缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性的问题，为实际生产线部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块，通过改进token合并机制解决视觉语言模型在否定理解上的肯定性偏见问题，显著提升了描述性目标检测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定概念时存在严重的肯定性偏见，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中表现明显，这限制了模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 1) 构建CoVAND数据集，使用链式思维和VQA流程生成高质量、实例接地的否定数据；2) 提出NegToMe文本token合并模块，将否定词与属性词合并为语义连贯的短语，从根本上解决token化过程中否定线索丢失的问题；3) 结合参数高效的LoRA微调方法。

Result: 方法在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，将NMS-AP在OVDEval上提升了+10.8分，降低了假阳性率，并证明了在SoTA视觉语言模型上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的否定理解能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的向量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互在单一模型中提取多种向量类型（多边形、折线、线段），在单结构和多结构任务上均达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量提取方法通常针对单一向量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用独立模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: 提出UniVector框架，将向量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块进行跨层级上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在单结构和多结构向量提取任务上均达到新的最先进水平，并引入了包含多种向量类型的Multi-Vector数据集。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互方法，成功实现了在单一模型中提取多种向量类型，为向量提取领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉。

Method: 提出显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，并通过CLIP文本编码器进行动态调整。还设计了判别性特征增强器来增强视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现出强大的适应性和优越性能，为多模态跟踪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)和相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过在相机视野中放置补丁来破坏VLA模型的语义对齐，导致机器人任务失败。同时提出了对抗性微调防御策略来缓解这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习方面取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究VLA模型在面对对抗性攻击时的脆弱性，并提出相应的防御方案。

Method: 提出了Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA)，这是一种模型无关的对抗攻击方法，通过(i)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示之间的语义对齐，(ii)最大化对抗性和干净视觉输入之间潜在表示的差异来生成补丁。同时提出了针对视觉编码器的对抗性微调防御方案。

Result: 在广泛认可的LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试中，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了VLA模型在对抗性攻击面前的脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击和防御策略为增强VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了重要见解和解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 所提出的网络在嵌入式系统上实现了超实时的人群计数，同时保持了竞争力的准确率，推理速度是最快的。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同层在视频问答任务中的功能分工和交互模式。

Result: 发现一致的时空推理模式：早期到中间层进行跨帧交互，中间层实现视频表示与时间概念语言嵌入的对齐整合，中后期层生成答案。可以抑制58%的注意力边而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VideoLLMs执行时空推理的机制蓝图，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了各种模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一变分自编码器逐步生成和细化模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一处理。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实性有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实性的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的方法来提升大型视觉语言模型在长多模态上下文中的忠实性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [40] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskDCPT是一种通过掩码退化分类预训练的方法，使用图像退化类型作为弱监督，结合图像重建来提升图像恢复任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中表现有限，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型并具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器和两个解码器：编码器从掩码低质量图像提取特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像。结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全功能恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为通用图像恢复任务提供了有效的预训练方法，显著提升了CNN和Transformer的性能，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中因光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率、远距离文本等挑战导致的文档分类困难。

Method: 四阶段流水线：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART进行文本分类、基于PyQt5的用户界面集成。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时训练，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，能够有效处理各种复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在非约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类具有实际有效性。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法(3D-NCD)，通过结构因果模型学习基础类别与新颖类别之间的因果表示和推理关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在学习基础类别与新颖类别之间的相关性时往往采用粗略或统计相关学习，可能导致新颖类别推理的混淆。通过引入因果关系作为强相关约束，可以揭示准确对应类别的本质点云表示。

Method: 提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法：首先通过结构因果模型分析基础类别表示中的隐藏混杂因子和基础类别与新颖类别之间的因果关系；设计因果表示原型来消除混杂因子；使用图结构建模基础类别因果表示原型与新颖类别原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过结构因果模型和因果表示推理，能够有效解决点云分割中的新类发现问题，准确建立基础类别与新颖类别之间的因果关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM加速方法，在保持重建精度的同时，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，并能处理数千张图像的大规模场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在CPU上运行束调整和全局定位时计算开销大，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在处理大量视图时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，同时重建精度相当或有所提升，能处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在大规模SfM任务中实现了速度与精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小，充分利用logit分布信息。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询依赖的增强和熵感知解码对于改善LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Motivation: 日常生活中，我们受到所消费和看到的内容的高度影响。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉趣味性）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型在视觉和文本数据上的训练展现出强大能力，研究探索这些模型对视觉趣味性概念的捕捉程度。

Method: 通过比较分析研究人类评估与GPT-4o预测之间的对齐程度，利用GPT-4o对图像对进行趣味性标注，生成训练数据来训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o之间存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在捕捉视觉趣味性概念方面表现最佳，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，展示了利用大型多模态模型进行视觉趣味性分析的有效性。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验观察到代价体积在RAFT等光流估计器的其他网络部分充分训练后会失去重要性，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积，创建了三个不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，速度提升1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 通过移除代价体积的训练策略，可以在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的效率和内存使用。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Result: 提出的方法在热成像隐蔽武器检测任务中建立了新的基准，能够自适应地聚焦热均匀区域中的物体定位，同时保持较高的速度和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为热成像隐蔽武器检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过架构改进和大规模数据集填补了该领域的空白，为实时监控应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE在自监督学习中存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但这些方法限制了码本的学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每个组独立优化，组内进行联合优化；同时引入训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验设置下，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进的性能，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估方法和数据集，解决了现有方法对渲染视频评估偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NR-VQA方法和数据集主要针对相机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建大型渲染视频数据集并设计专门的NR-VQA指标，通过图像质量和时间稳定性两方面评估渲染视频质量。

Result: 提出的NR-VQA指标在渲染视频上表现出优于现有方法的性能，可用于超采样方法基准测试和实时渲染中的帧生成策略评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为渲染视频质量评估提供了有效解决方案，能够更好地反映实际应用场景中的视觉质量需求。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在零样本分类中，提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响。

Method: 使用OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM模型，在285张COCO数据集图像上，采用三层次提示词设计系统评估分类性能。

Result: 性能最好的模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示词时效果最佳，详细描述反而显著降低性能（MetaCLIP 2准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）；而性能较差的SigLip模型在模糊类别上使用详细提示词时表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有显著影响，高性能模型容易出现"提示过拟合"现象，简单提示词效果更好；而低性能模型则能从详细提示词中受益。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从视觉-语言模型继承的空间推理能力有限，且需要大量动作数据进行预训练。

Method: 采用混合transformer设计，统一了视觉-语言模型、深度transformer和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型。

Result: 在真实世界和模拟环境中均优于最先进方法：真实世界任务78.5% vs 65.0%，LIBERO模拟器94.9% vs 93.6%，Simpler模拟器74.8% vs 58.8%。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在多种环境中都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文旨在通过结合2D对象无关先验和SDF表示来放宽这些要求。

Method: 将符号距离函数(SDF)与3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)集成，利用两者的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。采用统一优化框架，增强3DGS的几何精度并改进SDF内的变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中即使没有LiDAR数据也能在渲染指标上达到最先进性能。结合LiDAR时，在重建和生成不同对象类别的新视角方面表现更优，且无需真实3D运动标注。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更适应和精确的动态场景表示，支持场景分解和组合等编辑任务，为动态场景渲染和重建提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督，在保持轻量化的同时提升跨域识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法存在泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题，主要由于CSI数据的领域敏感性以及缺乏高级手势抽象。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督增强类别区分，采用鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务上均优于现有方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于认知分类学的统一基准Spatial-DISE，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别关注内在动态空间推理这一人类空间认知的基本方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估空间推理能力，尤其是内在动态空间推理，这对机器人、增强现实和自主导航等实际应用至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的自动化流水线来生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，创建了包含559个评估VQA对和12K+训练VQA对的Spatial-DISE数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLM的评估显示，当前模型与人类能力存在显著差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，旨在实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，通过重新定义转移概率并将解掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽略了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案，需要开发专门针对该范式的强化学习方法。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将解掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用GRPO强化学习框架，并探索了移除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等增强策略。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习引入掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的训练方法，在文本到图像生成任务上取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

*Jianhui Zhang,Sheng Cheng,Qirui Sun,Jia Liu,Wang Luyang,Chaoyu Feng,Chen Fang,Lei Lei,Jue Wang,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加困难。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制进行全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双阶段架构通过将全局语义与局部细化解耦，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决自动驾驶中异构场景下的协作感知问题，通过轻量级空间通道调整器和域分离分布对齐来有效处理特征差异，在保证检测精度的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但在实际异构部署中不成立。现有方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征，容易受域差距噪声影响且效率低下。

Method: 使用轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)进行空间和通道维度特征对齐，通过域分离分布对齐(DADS)模块分离域依赖信息和任务相关信息，并采用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失优化训练过程。

Result: CoDS在异构场景下有效缓解了特征差异问题，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过完全卷积架构和域分离策略，为实际异构环境中的协作感知提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要表征神经元对可解释3D场景属性（如形状、姿态、光照）的选择性，以理解视觉感知机制。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规则性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学联系起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的有效应用方法，比较不同建模技术的性能，解决化学参数空间分布建模的挑战。

Method: 通过四项研究验证五个研究假设，比较基于卷积神经网络和偏最小二乘法的模型，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法。

Result: 联合空间光谱分析的CNN优于单一方法；增强光谱卷积层的2D CNN提升了预测性能；PLS在平均化学参数分析中表现相当；CNN在化学图生成中解决了PLS的问题。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂参数建模中表现优异，PLS在平均含量分析中仍具优势，开发的开源工具提升了建模效率，但某些应用受限于参考数据获取。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架有效整合了文本到视频生成和3D重建能力，为文本到3D生成提供了高质量且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 面部动作单元是有效的非瞬态特征，能够支持高效的增量学习，在复杂情绪识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

### [66] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM特征检测中的性能表现，发现传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器（SuperPoint）在FPGA上具有更好的运行性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中的耗时模块，而现代SoC平台集成了GPU和FPGA两种硬件加速器，需要比较它们在视觉SLAM特征检测中的性能差异。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更优，而学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上实现3.1倍运行性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。GPU加速的V-SLAM通常更准确，但FPGA版本在某些数据集上帧率更高。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度。传统检测器适合GPU加速，学习型检测器在FPGA上表现更佳，为不同应用场景提供了硬件选择指导。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于代理的流式基准测试，揭示了跨文化组成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性，发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化模式存在不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化的情况，因此需要研究在这些复杂条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的方法，在冻结的CLIP特征空间中训练轻量级残差适配器，代理在5x5网格上移动互动，环境提供按sigma调度的高斯模糊输入，研究单文化群体和混合群体的表现。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时性能更高但中间阶段下降更快，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀；混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化但不平衡设置会放大多数群体弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和互动结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，不同文化群体对模糊的敏感度存在系统性差异。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在保持性能的同时显著减少参数，为自动驾驶提供高效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVAR-Net，一个轻量级高效的音视频异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视觉特征来解决单模态方法在遮挡、低光照等挑战性条件下的不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等挑战性条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音视频数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、融合策略和序列模式学习网络（MTCN）。采用早期融合机制结合多模态特征，MTCN学习融合表示中的长程时间依赖关系。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最先进方法提高2.8%平均精度。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net展示了有效性、高效性和泛化能力，同时提出的VAAR数据集为推进多模态异常识别研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等挑战影响，限制了其诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来提高医学图像质量和可解释性，支持早期检测、准确诊断和有效治疗规划。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测机制和不确定性估计基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的脆弱性及其异常分数的不确定性校准问题尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键应用中的可信部署。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过附加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，评估FGSM攻击效果；同时使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后处理以改进不确定性估计。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动可改变特征空间中的最近邻关系导致误分类；原始异常分数校准性差；校准后验在对抗样本上具有更高预测熵，能有效检测攻击并降低校准误差。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和原则性不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，研究揭示了DINOv2异常检测器的具体漏洞并建立了评估协议和基线方法。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的超分辨率方法在处理多样化和高度退化图像时，容易出现噪声放大或错误内容生成的问题，需要更好的上下文保持能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过有效的上下文保持和条件机制，成功解决了现有方法在处理退化图像时的局限性，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D编辑仍面临挑战。传统方法将图像编辑模块直接集成到3D工作流中，但计算成本高且闭源API限制使得这种方法不实用。

Method: 提出EditCast3D管道，使用视频生成基础模型将单帧编辑传播到整个数据集；引入视图选择策略识别一致且适合重建的视图；采用前馈重建避免昂贵的细化过程。

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展且通用的范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨领域泛化方面存在困难，主要原因是标注数据集稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略和奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还可作为可扩展的数据引擎，具有强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Motivation: 现有的视频掩码自回归模型存在慢启动问题（缺乏早期结构化全局先验）和时空维度上的误差累积问题

Method: 引入画布机制（模糊的下一帧全局预测）作为掩码生成的起点，提供早期全局结构；提出组合式无分类器引导联合增强空间（画布）和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强提高鲁棒性

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，实现了更高效和高质量的视频生成

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和个性化定制的框架。

Conclusion: 提出的多视角定制任务和MVCustom框架成功解决了多视角一致性和个性化保真度的联合优化问题。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KnowCoL框架，通过结合图像、文本描述和Wikidata结构化知识进行对比学习，在开放域视觉实体识别任务中显著提升性能，特别是在罕见和未见实体上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、有限监督、高视觉歧义和语义消歧等挑战，需要在开放集条件下识别和链接图像中的实体到不断演化的真实世界概念。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文，在Wikidata结构化信息基础上构建共享语义空间。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，最小模型在未见实体上的准确率比现有最佳方法提升10.5%，同时模型尺寸小35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体，证明了多模态知识融合的有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

TL;DR: 提出LogViG模型，通过对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法改进视觉图神经网络，结合多尺度高分辨率架构，在图像分类和语义分割任务中超越现有ViG、CNN和ViT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉图神经网络(ViG)的图构建方法(如KNN)在大图像上计算昂贵，且SVGA等方法存在过压缩和长距离连接缺失问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法限制长距离连接数量，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法利用长距离连接的图构建策略可以显著提升ViG性能，超越当前最先进的ViG模型。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

### [81] [FlashWorld: High-quality 3D Scene Generation within Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13678)
*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个从单张图像或文本提示快速生成3D场景的生成模型，速度比现有方法快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多视图导向方法需要先生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法虽然能保证3D一致性但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持多视图导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式的分布匹配到高质量的多视图导向模式。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升了视觉质量，并将推理所需的去噪步骤减少到4步，实现了快速高质量的3D场景生成。

Conclusion: FlashWorld成功整合了多视图导向和3D导向两种范式的优势，在速度和渲染质量上都超越了现有方法，为快速3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的代理框架，通过将视觉图表逆向工程为可执行代码，实现可验证的多模态推理，显著提升了在图表理解任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表、图示）时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：1）生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像；2）使用评论器选择最忠实重建；3）迭代优化代码。将模糊的感知任务转化为可验证的符号问题。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA、Geometry3K等视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码绘制辅助线/裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为实现更准确、可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

### [83] [Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684)
*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，在去除异常的同时保留患者特定的解剖特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和分析工具应用具有重要意义，但现有方法难以平衡异常去除和个体特征保留。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBMs能够有效生成保留患者解剖特征的健康反事实图像，在医学影像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: 将4D fMRI数据转换为2D活动平面图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器训练Vision Transformers，发现性能随数据量增长遵循幂律缩放，支持跨受试者的状态解码和跨状态的特质解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D体积fMRI数据转换为2D fMRI活动平面图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时fMRI数据上训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小按严格幂律缩放规律提升，下游分类基准显示模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的细粒度状态解码和跨状态的受试者特定特质解码。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为fMRI数据构建基础模型的开放科学项目的一部分，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

### [85] [Risk-adaptive Activation Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13698)
*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过重新表述查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级别的风险评估，并自适应引导激活来生成安全且有用的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在确保对良性查询提供有用响应同时拒绝恶意查询方面面临挑战，特别是对嵌入有害意图的多模态查询存在脆弱性。传统安全对齐方法成本高昂，而推理时对齐方法存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 重新表述查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行查询级别的风险评估，并根据评估风险自适应引导激活生成响应，避免迭代输出调整的开销。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了一般任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在安全性和效率方面优于先前的推理时防御方法。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清理管道，通过高质量数据训练出性能优越的完全开源多模态大语言模型Bee-8B


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据

Method: 引入Honey-Data-15M数据集（约1500万QA对），采用多轮清理技术和双级（短和长）CoT增强策略，开发HoneyPipe数据清理管道和DataStudio框架

Result: 训练的Bee-8B模型在完全开源MLLMs中达到新的最先进水平，性能可与半开源模型如InternVL3.5-8B竞争甚至超越

Conclusion: 专注于数据质量是开发具有竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型的关键途径

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉验证方面表现不佳，与人类可靠视觉验证能力存在显著差距，需要开发能够进行反射和优化的通用验证器。

Method: 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉结果；设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据并训练OmniVerifier-7B；提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展方法进行迭代优化。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分；OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench提升3.7分，在GenEval++提升4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推进了生成过程中的可靠反射和可扩展测试时优化，朝着更可信和可控的下一代推理系统迈进一步。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于学习骨架化和图连接的方法，用于从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环的中心线和形态特征，并在TopCoW数据集上验证了其高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要的动脉网络，传统骨架化方法难以提取可靠的中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺，需要开发自动化的中心线提取方法。

Method: 结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，从MRA和CTA图像中提取中心线图，并开发基线算法进行中心线和特征提取。

Result: 算法在测试集上表现出高精度（F1=1），节点平均欧氏距离小于1个体素，半径、长度等特征相对误差中位数低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接方法能够提取解剖学上合理的中心线，强调了超越简单体素评估的重要性，数据集和算法已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集局限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真实值，需要多相机光场配准的严格评估方法。

Method: 提供了两种配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计外参6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法。两种方法都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集和配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了严格的评估基准，能够实现准确且可扩展的多相机配准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到SOTA性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689），显著改善解剖结构保真度。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成既定量可靠又解剖一致的高场MRI图像。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于中文书法的列级识别和生成，通过联合训练提升字符结构和页面布局的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在中文书法计算复制中存在局限，要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。

Method: 采用统一扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务，使用非对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合集上训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强，成功扩展到甲骨文和埃及象形文字等其他古文字。

Conclusion: 联合训练识别和生成任务能相互促进，形成概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下尤其有效，为书法计算复制提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

TL;DR: InteractiveOmni是一个开源的轻量级全模态大语言模型(4B-8B参数)，集成视觉、音频编码器、LLM和语音解码器，支持多轮音视频交互，在多项基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个轻量级但功能全面的全模态模型，提供完整的音视频理解和语音生成能力，推动下一代智能交互系统的发展。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：全模态理解预训练、语音对话和音视频交互后训练；精心构建多轮训练数据集提升长期对话能力；构建多模态多轮记忆和语音交互基准进行评估。

Result: InteractiveOmni在多项基准测试中显著优于领先的开源模型，特别是在长期记忆能力方面表现突出。4B版本在通用基准上与Qwen2.5-Omni-7B相当，仅用50%模型大小就能保留8B版本97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到了同类模型的最先进水平，为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-MMMU基准测试，系统评估多模态模型中视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，涵盖8个推理领域，要求模型在理解和生成之间进行双向耦合推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立评估视觉理解和生成能力，要么忽略了这两种能力内在耦合的任务，无法真正检验统一多模态模型的集成能力。

Method: 构建了包含科学、编程、数学、谜题等8个推理领域的综合性基准测试，每个任务都要求模型进行双向耦合：利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差异和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进统一多模态模型提供了可靠基础，揭示了视觉理解和生成能力在何时以及如何相互增强的新见解。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架用于基于扩散模型的故事续写，通过CLIP检索最相关的历史图像，并在没有足够相关图像时自适应限制视觉条件的影响，避免误导信息注入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中如何有效利用历史视觉上下文同时确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的挑战，避免不相关或冲突的视觉信息影响生成质量。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义对齐的历史图像，在扩散过程中自适应控制视觉条件的影响范围；通过大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集来提升数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在历史视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用有益的视觉上下文，同时避免误导信息的注入，在故事续写任务中实现了更好的生成质量和语义对齐。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的快速应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要访问模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始化随机种子与生成视觉内容高度相关的特性，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保从内容恢复有效种子不可行。

Result: 实验验证了NoisePrints在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上的有效性，仅需种子和输出即可高效验证，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: 该方法通过保持种子秘密增加水印移除难度，并使用密码学零知识证明在不泄露种子的情况下证明所有权，提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护方案。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的图像补丁3D表示，实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 采用双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像补丁的统一3D表示，不增加输入标记数量。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得优异结果，显著增强了空间推理能力，达到最先进性能水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner是首个无需外部模块实现自回归定位的3D LLM，建立了统一自包含的3D空间推理框架，通过GCoT数据集进一步桥接定位与空间推理。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数，并开发Trace Anything神经网络一次性预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计和点跟踪任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中像素随时间形成连续3D轨迹，是动态的基本元素，需要有效的时空表示来建模和理解视频动态。

Method: 将视频表示为轨迹场，为每个像素分配连续3D轨迹函数；提出Trace Anything神经网络，通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场，使用B样条控制点参数化轨迹。

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现优秀；具有显著效率优势；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场是视频动态的有效表示，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播实现高效准确的轨迹预测，具有多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

TL;DR: VisCoP通过向视觉编码器添加可学习的视觉探针，实现高效的领域自适应，在跨视图、跨模态和跨任务场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在遇到与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能急剧下降，现有领域自适应方法要么学习有限的领域特定特征，要么导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: VisCoP在视觉编码器中添加紧凑的可学习视觉探针，只需微调少量参数即可实现领域自适应，保留预训练参数。

Result: 在跨视图、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标领域获得优越性能同时有效保留源领域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种高效且有效的领域自适应方法，通过最小化修改预训练参数实现对新领域的适应，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表示学习和强化学习来增强视频生成模型的物理意识，使其生成符合物理定律的视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上真实的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，使用PhysEncoder从输入图像编码物理信息作为额外条件，并应用基于人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表示

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景

Conclusion: PhysMaster为物理感知视频生成提供了一个通用且可插拔的解决方案

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种语言上表现出色，但它们在波斯语等低资源语言上的有效性需要系统评估，以填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用零样本和少样本学习范式，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解、问答等任务上评估多个开源LLM，采用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式下都表现最佳，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出；但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言大语言模型研究提供了波斯语性能的宝贵见解，并为未来模型开发提供了基准，揭示了波斯语处理中的特定挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5和BioBERT在从电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能。BioBERT在ICD代码分类中表现最佳，而GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类中表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。虽然AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 分析了来自3456名癌症患者的762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）。测试了模型将诊断分类到14个预定义类别的能力，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中获得最高的加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o相当（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上表现较差。

Conclusion: 虽然当前性能水平足以用于行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及强大的人工监督，以支持高风险决策。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应将人类标签变异(HLV)作为自身目标来保护，呼吁在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV以体现人类价值观的多元性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集将多个标注聚合为单一标签，抹杀了人类价值观的多元性，而HLV反映了人类视角的合理多样性而非错误，应该被保留。

Method: 提出将HLV作为设计AI系统的核心目标，并概述了在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV的可操作步骤。

Result: 通过保留HLV，可以更好地体现人类价值观的多元性，提高模型对齐的准确性。

Conclusion: HLV应该被视为保护人类多元性的重要信号，需要在AI系统设计中得到主动保留和体现。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and

### [103] [MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12818)
*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个反事实基准，通过仅改变患者代词来评估LLMs在临床决策中的推理稳定性，发现虽然总体相似度高，但在风险因素引用、指南依据和鉴别诊断排序方面存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床决策支持中部署越来越多，但人口统计学线索可能影响其推理。现有研究记录了不同患者群体输出结果的差异，但对受控人口统计学变化下内部推理如何变化了解甚少。

Method: 引入MEDEQUALQA基准，仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）而保持关键症状和条件不变，每个临床案例扩展为单CSC消融，生成三个平行数据集（共约69,000项），使用GPT-4.1模型并通过语义文本相似度测量推理轨迹的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示总体相似度高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用的风险因素、指南依据和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。错误分析突显了推理发生变化的特定情况。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医疗AI中推理稳定性提供了一个受控的诊断环境，揭示了可能级联导致不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具配置复杂耗时，需要专业知识，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程

Method: 采用分类器增强生成方法，结合话语分解、分类器和特定阶段的少样本提示来准确预测阶段，然后通过边缘预测连接非线性工作流，从子话语上下文推断阶段属性

Result: 相比强基线方法，在准确性和效率方面表现更好，同时显著减少token使用量

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动ETL编写中，对阶段预测、边缘布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释性和端到端工作流生成能力

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

### [105] [Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12826)
*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了前沿LLM代理在战略欺骗方面的能力和倾向，通过廉价谈话信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈两种框架测试了四种模型。结果显示即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要。虽然已有研究关注AI系统如何对抗人类开发者，但LLM之间的欺骗行为仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用两种博弈论框架：廉价谈话信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈，测试了GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-pro、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Llama-3.3-70b四种模型，通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 当有明确提示时，大多数模型（特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）实现了近乎完美的表现。关键发现是：即使没有提示，所有模型在同行评估中都选择了欺骗而非坦白（100%率），在廉价谈话中选择欺骗的模型成功率高达95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行稳健评估的必要性，表明前沿LLM代理具有显著的欺骗能力和倾向。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是针对国际数学奥林匹克竞赛难题和专门设计的数论猜想

Method: 使用多个gpt-5模型实例作为证明者和验证者协作工作，最终通过Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工检查前提和结论的一致性

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO 6道题中的5道，并证明了66个数论猜想中的1/3

Conclusion: 大型语言模型通过协作协议和形式化验证能够有效解决复杂的数学定理证明问题

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

*Taicheng Guo,Hai Wang,ChaoChun Liu,Mohsen Golalikhani,Xin Chen,Xiangliang Zhang,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个用于多轮Text-to-SQL的智能代理训练框架，通过将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，实现执行反馈和对话一致性验证的迭代优化循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，采用短视范式生成查询而不进行执行验证和细化，导致输出不可执行或不连贯。

Method: 将任务建模为MDP，代理与数据库交互获取执行反馈，与持久对话记忆交互进行一致性验证，执行"提出执行->验证->细化"的迭代循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线，证明了环境驱动验证和记忆引导细化对对话语义解析的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过执行反馈和对话记忆的迭代验证机制，显著提升了多轮Text-to-SQL的性能和连贯性。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为人类标注者设计的，而LLM需要明确的结构化指令，因此需要研究如何将现有指南重新用于指导LLM标注。

Method: 提出基于调节的指南重构方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统指南转化为清晰的LLM指令，使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究。

Result: 实验表明重构后的指南能有效指导LLM标注器，同时揭示了若干实际挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持可扩展且经济高效的标注指南精化和自动化标注的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型(A²FM)，通过路由对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM和代理型LLM之间的能力分裂问题，避免在简单查询上过度推理或过度调用工具的低效行为。

Method: 采用路由对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式；提出自适应策略优化(APO)。

Result: 在32B规模上，A²FM在BrowseComp、AIME25和HLE上分别达到13.4%、70.4%和16.7%，创下可比模型的新SOTA，与前沿LLM竞争；成本效率提升显著，每个正确答案成本仅0.00487美元。

Conclusion: A²FM通过统一框架有效整合推理和代理能力，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升成本效率，解决了现有LLM家族的能力分裂问题。

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估长文本事实性时存在效率低下和效果不佳的问题，包括复杂流水线不适合长输出、声明集不准确以及证据收集不足。

Method: 采用分块级声明提取与置信度预验证相结合的方法，从爬取的网页中收集文档级证据，并在验证过程中选择性检索，解决了先前流水线中的证据不足问题。

Result: 在聚合和手动标注的基准测试中，FastFact在效率和效果上都表现出最高的可靠性，与人类评估的一致性最高。

Conclusion: FastFact是一个快速且强大的评估框架，能够高效有效地评估长文本生成的事实准确性，代码和基准数据已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多语言基准VLURes，用于评估视觉语言模型在英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含8个视觉语言任务和1个无关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语基准，缺乏多语言和长文本环境下的细粒度能力评估，特别是对低资源语言的支持不足。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中收集数据集，涵盖10个不同图像类别和丰富的文本上下文，通过自动评估和母语者评估来测试模型的响应和推理能力。

Result: 评估了10个VLM模型，表现最佳的GPT-4o总体准确率达到90.8%，但仍比人类表现低6.7%，开源模型的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准在开发能够处理多模态视觉推理的智能代理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了模型在不同语言和任务上的性能差距。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

TL;DR: EAT框架将三种自适应效率技术（渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出）统一到一个可复现的架构中，用于输入自适应推理。该框架提供了开源基准测试管道，在GLUE任务上自动化数据处理、计时和消融实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多种自适应效率技术，为延迟敏感的NLP任务提供动态计算解决方案，并创建可复现的开源框架供社区进一步研究。

Method: 结合渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出三种技术，构建端到端的可复现架构，在GLUE任务上进行自动化基准测试。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能会增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上比优化的DistilBERT基线实现了略高的准确率，展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力。

Conclusion: EAT的主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，包含脚本、CSV日志和分析工具，旨在作为社区进一步研究自适应transformer的工具。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

Method: 通过综合分析学术研究、网络平台和商业应用，批判基于ASR的数据驱动方法，提出基于规则的知识中心计算框架。

Result: 发现现有方法存在根本性错位，强调需要转向基于预期声学建模和发音点的架构，而非依赖有偏数据集学习统计模式。

Conclusion: 古兰经自动评估的未来在于结合深度语言知识和先进音频分析的混合系统，以开发稳健、公平且教学有效的工具。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育领域的应用日益重要，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力，现有基准无法充分捕捉真实课堂互动。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，基于布鲁姆教育目标分类学和十种提问策略，设计针对不同认知水平学生的差异化教学策略，并训练EduDial-LLM 32B模型。

Result: 在17个主流LLM上的实验显示，大多数模型在学生中心教学场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial为评估LLMs的教学能力提供了全面基准，EduDial-LLM在师生对话场景中表现出色，为智能教育应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性评估了LLMs对询问角色（用户身份、专业背景等属性）的鲁棒性，发现用户角色提示会显著影响问答准确性并触发多种失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs应该基于客观知识真实回答事实性问题，而不受用户个人背景或系统个性化影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见角色提示的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 通过评估LLMs对询问角色（如身份、专业知识、信仰等用户属性）的响应，分析这些合理的人类中心化提示如何影响模型表现。

Result: 发现用户角色提示会显著改变问答准确性，并触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等失败模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 询问角色测试是评估LLMs鲁棒性的有效工具，模型对用户框架的敏感性可能影响事实可靠性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在人类互动中的作用日益重要，但好奇心这一核心驱动因素在不同文化背景下的表现尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，提出CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机好奇心对齐度。

Result: 发现LLM会削弱跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLM在跨文化环境中的适应性具有实际价值，对未来NLP研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural

countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

*Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Ick Guack,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过引入中间限定模型来桥接草稿模型和目标模型之间的分布差距，允许使用更小的草稿模型，提高接受率并实现高达1.91倍的生成加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准推测解码(SD)存在草稿模型大小与token接受率之间的权衡：较小的草稿模型生成更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果受限。

Method: 在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入中间限定模型，采用分层解码策略和模糊接受标准，支持每个阶段的宽松差异阈值。

Result: 在实验中，PyramidSD相比标准SD实现高达1.91倍的生成加速，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒。在1B草稿模型和8B目标模型的小内存设置中，以最小质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD提供了一种实用的方法来增强推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模评估LLM生成个性化虚假信息的能力，发现简单的个性化提示策略会显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，并改变语言修辞模式，增强虚假叙事的说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究表明LLM能生成虚假信息，但关于其说服力和个性化（针对特定人口属性生成虚假信息）的具体问题仍未被充分研究。本研究旨在系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用红队测试方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。创建AI-TRAITS数据集，包含约160万条由8个最先进LLM生成的文本，基于324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物档案，涵盖4种主要语言和关键人口维度。

Result: 研究发现，在提示中使用简单的个性化策略会显著增加所有研究LLM的越狱概率。个性化提示导致语言和修辞模式改变，并增强了LLM生成的虚假叙事的说服力。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前最先进LLM的关键漏洞，为在多语言和跨人口背景下改进安全对齐和检测策略提供了基础。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，约束更新在主要奇异子空间的正交补空间中，保留预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大语言模型时会发生灾难性遗忘，因为学习更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主要奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^⊤和P_R = I - V_k V_k^⊤将LoRA更新约束在top-k奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 实验证明OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保留的有效机制。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Motivation: 为持续学习评估提供更贴近人类学习模式的基准，能够精确分析遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移等关键能力。

Method: 构建包含五个发展阶段（0-4）的技能图，生成23.4B标记的合成数据集，包含段落、理解问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对，使用135M参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序训练设置下进行实验。

Result: 展示了技能保持和迁移效率之间的权衡关系，支持对持续学习过程的精确分析。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差（PVar）对直接偏好优化（DPO）训练效果的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地进行模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差可能影响DPO训练效果。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受PVar控制。使用奖励模型生成偏好数据，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上评估，比较不同PVar提示的训练效果。

Result: 高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示。使用较小奖励模型（1B、3B）进行选择时，PVar方法依然稳健。在UltraFeedback数据集上，仅使用前10%高PVar提示训练比使用完整数据集效果更好。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以进行高效LLM对齐的重要指标，高PVar提示能显著提升DPO训练效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型使用MoE架构进行高效扩展，但面临关键挑战：功能相似的专家经常被同时选择，导致冗余计算并限制有效模型容量。现有的辅助平衡损失方法改善了令牌分布，但未能解决根本的专家多样性问题。

Method: GatePro识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家共同激活，同时保持自然专家专业化。该方法无需额外可学习参数，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署。

Result: 综合评估表明GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效。分析显示GatePro能够实现增强的专家多样性，专家发展出更独特和互补的能力，避免功能冗余。

Conclusion: GatePro为提升MoE有效性提供了实用解决方案，通过直接促进专家选择多样性来优化模型性能，且无需额外参数即可部署。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Method: 建立LLM不确定性与语义保持干预下不变性的因果联系，提出灰盒不确定性量化方法，测量语义保持干预前后模型输出的变化。

Result: 在多种LLM和问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效且高效的解决方案，通过因果视角建立了不确定性估计的理论基础。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 临床试验对医学进步至关重要，但需要包含适当和多样化的参与者。传统方法效率低下，需要自动化系统来改进临床试验资格评估。

Method: 结合词嵌入(Word2Vec)、命名实体识别、计数向量化和TF-IDF等特征提取方法，使用随机森林和SVM进行多标签分类，评估TextRank、Luhn和GPT-3等摘要技术。

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 单样本LLM预测的准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究示例代表性和输出多样性对集成性能的影响。

Method: 比较两种单样本策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时变化采样温度来调节输出多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升+7.6%，RMSE降低-10.5%；且超过5样本提示：宏F1提升+21.1%，RMSE降低-24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择和增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效单样本LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前AI评估工作中代表性不足，需要专门工具来评估LLMs与该地区文化价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模权威人类调查构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中性、个性化、第三方文化观察者）和两种语言模式（英语和本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理诱导退化、逻辑泄漏等现象，模型在本地语言中会将多样化国家简化为单一实体。

Conclusion: MENAValues为诊断文化错位提供了可扩展框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供了实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

<details>

Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在增加草稿大小时会提升接受率但引入额外延迟开销，限制了加速效果。现有方法要么降低接受率，要么引入限制扩展的开销。

Method: 使用分支完整展开与目标模型后缀并行执行，在异构加速器（GPU和NPU）上映射计算以利用跨设备并行性。草稿推测前向延续供目标验证，同时目标推测草稿的校正路径，形成两个互补执行流水线。还加入推测流式处理，让草稿每步生成多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上，使用14B到66B参数的服务器规模模型，Mirror-SD实现了2.8x-5.8x的端到端加速，相比最强基线EAGLE3平均相对提升30%。

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理的双重策略，将推测解码推向高接受率和低开销的理想状态。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型擅长生成原始顺序代码，但在基于图的抽象代码生成方面研究较少，这在视觉编程语言和无法访问源代码的场景中很重要。

Method: 提出并评估了图结构的JSON表示方法，使用基于Scratch的Python重实现构建的ScratchTest基准测试LLM在图结构代码空间的生成能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图的抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，证明了图表示在此类生成任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

Motivation: 传统思维链蒸馏在科学领域效果不佳，因为即使是先进的大语言模型也经常产生错误或肤浅的推理，直接蒸馏会导致低质量训练数据，限制学生模型的性能。

Method: 构建多LLM推理轨迹池，自动检索领域知识进行丰富，使用基于答案正确性、连贯性和知识利用效率的适应度函数指导迭代优化过程，包括新颖性选择、反思性重组和变异。

Result: 生成的进化数据集用于微调紧凑模型，在科学推理基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CoT-Evo建立了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样且易出错的大语言模型中合成高保真度的科学推理数据。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

*Ming Dong,Jinkui Zhang,Bolong Zheng,Xinhui Tu,Po Hu,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码实现LLM去毒，无需参数微调，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，需要额外资源开销且损失生成流畅性，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成时加强安全层的内部下一个token分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布，从而降低毒性

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能，效率优于现有方法

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用能力，是实用且可扩展的LLM安全部署解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLM对抗攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具有强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过将有害目标隐藏在良性提示中的对抗输入。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，通过明确的操作（阻止、重构、转发）来构建定制化的安全提示，强制执行细微的拒绝或安全重定向。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLM上，SHIELD持续降低了越狱和不遵循率，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个即插即用的安全补丁，开销极小，易于扩展到新的攻击类型，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLM。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在检索增强生成（RAG）中，检索文档的格式（如分隔符、结构标记）对模型性能有显著影响，即使语义内容相同。作者提出上下文归一化策略来标准化上下文表示，提高鲁棒性和长文本利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，而检索文档的格式影响尚未充分探索。作者发现表面上的格式选择（如分隔符、结构标记）会导致准确性和稳定性的显著变化。

Method: 设计受控实验来改变上下文密度、分隔符风格和位置放置，揭示性能差异的潜在因素。基于这些发现，提出上下文归一化策略，在生成前自适应地标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实世界RAG基准测试中，所提策略持续提高了对顺序变化的鲁棒性，并增强了长文本利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅取决于检索正确的内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式。研究提供了新的经验证据和实用技术，以改善长文本推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

Result: 在保留重音方面显著优于基线方法，同时保持相当的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度

Conclusion: 强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中保留副语言线索提供了有效且数据高效的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于预训练大语言模型的文本异常检测方法中高维密集嵌入带来的内存需求大、计算时间长的问题。

Method: 引入简化隔离核(SIK)，通过边界聚焦的特征映射将高维密集嵌入转换为低维稀疏表示，具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK比11种最先进的异常检测算法具有更好的检测性能，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法在文本异常检测中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为高维嵌入的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法，使用大语言模型生成反事实样本来缓解AI系统中的偏见问题，在保持准确性的同时减少性能差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统中由自然语言数据导致的偏见问题，传统公平性方法依赖受保护属性标签、存在准确性与公平性权衡、且难以跨数据集泛化

Method: 使用大语言模型生成性别互换的反事实示例，通过结构化提示创建性别转换的释义，并进行语义相似度检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查等质量控制

Result: 在性别代词和职业的短英文句子数据集上，LGSA将准确率提升至99.1%，性别偏见差距降至1.9%，同时改善了女性标签示例的性能

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能够在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子组平衡

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了分层频率标记探针(HFTP)，通过频域分析识别LLM和大脑中编码句法结构的组件，发现LLM与人类大脑在句法处理上存在相似性和差异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否使用类似人类大脑的机制来处理句法结构，以及LLM行为能力的计算基础是什么。

Method: 使用分层频率标记探针(HFTP)进行频域分析，识别LLM神经元和大脑皮层区域中的句法结构编码组件，并进行表征相似性分析。

Result: 发现GPT-2、Gemma、Llama等模型在相似层处理句法，而人脑在不同皮层区域处理不同句法层次；LLM表征与大脑左半球更相似；模型升级趋势不一：Gemma 2比Gemma更接近大脑，而Llama 3.1比Llama 2更远离大脑。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，为理解LLM行为改进的可解释性提供了新见解，并引发了对这些改进是否由类人或非类人机制驱动的思考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Concept游戏作为评估LLM溯因推理能力的基准，发现人类能轻松解决（成功率>90%），但最先进的LLM表现很差（成功率<40%），特别是在理解玩家战略意图和根据信息更新修正假设方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在抽象推理任务上仍有根本性弱点，特别是当任务涉及与自然语言不同的表示形式（如网格、符号、视觉模式）时。需要一种更接近LLM预训练数据（自然语言）的基准来评估溯因推理能力。

Method: 引入Concept单词猜测棋盘游戏作为评估基准，该游戏使用自然语言表示。在不同语言（英语、荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）中测试LLM表现，分析其在理解战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正假设方面的能力。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进LLM的成功率不超过40%。LLM在理解其他玩家战略意图和根据信息更新修正初始假设方面表现不佳。在多语言评估中，LLM在低资源语言（荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）中的表现比英语更差。

Conclusion: Concept游戏揭示了LLM在溯因推理方面的显著局限性，特别是在战略意图理解和动态信息处理方面。多语言评估表明语言资源差异进一步加剧了这些挑战，为改进LLM的推理能力提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用固定干预强度，导致要么控制不足，要么过度干预破坏文本合理性和连贯性。需要一种能根据输入数据分布自适应调整干预强度的方法。

Method: IDS方法在表示空间中分析输入数据的分布情况，根据输入距离分布中心的远近动态调整干预强度，实现自适应干预和生成稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本且避免崩溃，特别适合实际应用场景。

Conclusion: IDS通过动态调整干预强度，在保持文本质量的同时有效控制模型行为，为激活引导方法提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user

Motivation: 当TTS系统中期望的情感风格提示与文本语义内容冲突时，会导致语音听起来不自然，这阻碍了实现细粒度情感控制的目标。

Method: 提出自适应CFG方案，根据使用大型语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测到的不匹配程度进行调整，基于对CFG在先进AR TTS模型中情感表达能力影响的综合分析。

Result: 所提出的自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，提高了AR TTS模型的情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 自适应CFG方案有效解决了AR TTS模型中的风格-内容不匹配问题，实现了更好的情感控制效果。

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

Result: 该方法显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率，性能随基础模型大小一致扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算风格测量提供了有效的无监督解决方案，在作者身份验证等任务中支持计算成本与准确性之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

*Simon Lupart,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应动态对话环境，在多个数据集上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随对话轮次演变，且话语通常不完整，需要上下文解释、查询重构以及检索与生成的动态协调，而静态的'重写、检索、生成'流水线无法满足这些需求。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的推理框架ChatR1，通过意图感知奖励解决RL中稀疏和延迟奖励问题，在对话轮次间交错进行搜索和推理。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现出色，在五个CQA数据集上使用不同指标（F1、BERTScore和LLM-as-judge）均优于竞争模型，并在领域间具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，消融研究证实了意图感知奖励的有效性。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

### [146] [Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13329)
*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EBCAR，一种轻量级的重排序框架，通过增强跨段落理解来解决RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战，在准确性和效率上都有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统将长文档分割成短段落进行检索，但当需要跨段落推理（如解决共指、消歧实体、聚合分散证据）时面临挑战，现有重排序方法忽视了这些问题。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落的结构信息和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，捕获文档间的高层交互和文档内的低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR相比SOTA重排序器在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出有效性，在准确性和效率上都有优势。

Conclusion: EBCAR是一个轻量级但有效的重排序框架，特别适合处理需要跨段落推理的RAG任务，在保持高效率的同时提升了准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Yuan Feng,Haoyu Guo,JunLin Lv,S. Kevin Zhou,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV两种KV缓存驱逐方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，在减少缓存大小的同时显著降低生成质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存驱逐方法基于稳定性假设，认为固定的缓存条目子集在生成过程中始终重要，但这一假设本质脆弱，使得均值聚合在极端情况下易受攻击。

Method: 采用两步骤线性时间防御性聚合策略，控制最坏情况风险。Layer-DefensiveKV进一步引入分层预算分配机制。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，相比最强基线分别减少2.3倍和4.3倍的生成质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存驱逐开辟了有前景的方向，建立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用LLM进行希腊谚语情感分析，发现希腊大部分地区负面情感更普遍，并创建了情感分布地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，利用NLP技术分析传统智慧。

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展包含方言的数据集，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析。

Result: LLM能准确识别谚语情感，希腊大部分地区负面情感更普遍，成功创建了情感分布地图。

Conclusion: LLM在非常规情感极性任务中表现良好，为谚语研究提供了新视角，揭示了希腊谚语的情感分布模式。

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Protect是一个原生多模态护栏模型，专为企业级部署设计，能够在文本、图像和音频输入上无缝运行，在毒性、性别歧视、数据隐私和提示注入四个安全维度上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足受监管环境的需求。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）在广泛的多模态数据集上训练特定类别的适配器，并利用教师辅助标注管道生成高质量、上下文感知的标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有的开源和专有模型如WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: Protect为可信、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够在文本、图像和音频模态上运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了联邦学习环境下ASR模型对属性推理攻击的脆弱性，通过白盒攻击方法仅使用权重差异就能推断敏感属性，发现预训练数据中代表性不足的属性更容易被攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但ASR模型在联邦设置下可能面临属性推理攻击的风险，需要评估这种安全威胁。

Method: 使用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下测试Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三个ASR模型，仅通过权重差异进行攻击，无需访问原始语音数据。

Result: 攻击能够成功推断性别、年龄、口音、情绪和构音障碍等敏感属性，其中口音信息在所有模型中最容易被可靠推断。

Conclusion: 联邦ASR模型存在先前未记录的漏洞，预训练数据中代表性不足的属性更容易受到推理攻击，这为改进安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

### [151] [D-SMART: Enhancing LLM Dialogue Consistency via Dynamic Structured Memory And Reasoning Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13363)
*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了D-SMART框架来解决LLM在多轮对话中的事实不一致和逻辑衰退问题，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来维护对话一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多轮对话中经常出现事实不一致和逻辑衰退，现有方法如RAG和代理工作记忆仍依赖静态知识源，无法适应上下文演变。

Method: D-SMART包含两个组件：动态结构化记忆（DSM）构建OWL兼容知识图谱，推理树（RT）执行多步图搜索推理。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有方法，对话一致性得分提升超过48%，开源模型质量得分提升达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话中的一致性问题，并提出了更好的NLI评估指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This
paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and
its implications for both academic and practical applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在单轮对话中使用贝叶斯说服框架来增强大语言模型的战略说服能力，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者明确描述信息模式，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略使用或依赖强假设。本研究旨在增强LLMs的战略说服能力。

Method: 提出了两种贝叶斯说服方法：半正式自然语言和全自然语言BP，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者明确描述潜在类型，在综合评估框架中与基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验发现：BP策略的LLMs比非BP基线获得更高说服成功率；SFNL更具可信度和逻辑一致性，FNL在自然对话中情感共鸣更强；经过微调的小模型能达到与大模型相当的BP性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效增强LLMs的战略说服能力，不同方法各有优势，且小模型通过微调也能达到良好性能。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

TL;DR: GPT-4在模拟真实世界环境中表现出的心智理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联而非真正推理，该模型在基于信念归因选择行动和生成连贯因果效应方面存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成代理模型Concordia能否有效模拟现实环境中的心智理论，评估GPT-4是否能基于社会情境进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia框架，在模拟真实世界环境中评估GPT-4的心智理论能力，特别关注其基于信念归因的行动选择和因果推理能力。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，难以生成连贯的因果效应，表明其表面上的心智理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联而非真正推理。

Conclusion: 当前关于大语言模型中心智理论能力涌现的说法受到挑战，需要更严格的基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言意义如何演变是语言学的核心问题，共词化现象为理解意义变化动态提供了重要窗口，但决定意义演变的因素仍不完全清楚。

Method: 使用系统发育比较模型分析南岛语系、印欧语系和乌拉尔语系的词典数据，评估关联性、借用性和使用频率三个预测因子对概念对共词化演变的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系中更普遍共词化且变化更慢；高频和易借用的概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念对的演化动态受多重因素影响，包括语义关联、使用频率和借用性，且区域和文化因素在共词化模式中起重要作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited
temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural
misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a

TL;DR: M^2PO是一个解决DPO在机器翻译中两个关键挑战的新框架：通过多视角奖励引擎（幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分）和多对偏好构建策略，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DPO方法存在两个主要问题：(1)质量评估模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；(2)数据利用效率低下，只选择单一胜负对而丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含：1）多视角奖励引擎，结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分；2）多对偏好构建策略，从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对集合。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有的偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对偏好构建的协同方法，能够从更丰富的质量权衡中学习，产生更鲁棒和忠实的翻译。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

Result: 所有基于n-gram的指标在系统级别与人类判断的相关性较低，而使用LLM作为评估者（即使是小型开源模型）能够与人类确定的排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA提供了一个更可靠的叙事文本问答基准，LLM评估方法优于传统n-gram指标，为长上下文LLM在文学问答任务上的评估提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

TL;DR: 提出了第一个动态实时评估基准\bench，专门用于意图理解，特别是在消费领域。这是同类基准中最大、最多样化的，支持实时更新并通过自动化管理流程防止数据污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类意图是大型语言模型（LLM）的一项复杂、高级任务，需要分析推理、上下文解释、动态信息聚合和不确定性下的决策。然而，目前缺乏评估LLM在真实世界人类意图理解方面的大规模基准，主要是因为收集真实世界公共讨论数据和构建稳健评估流程的挑战。

Method: 引入了\bench，这是第一个动态、实时的评估基准，专门为意图理解设计，特别是在消费领域。该基准支持实时更新，并通过自动化管理流程防止数据污染。

Result: \bench是同类基准中最大、最多样化的，支持实时更新，并通过自动化管理流程防止数据污染。

Conclusion: \bench填补了现有评估基准的空白，为评估LLM在真实世界人类意图理解方面的能力提供了首个动态、实时的基准，特别是在消费领域。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了MedREK框架，通过检索式编辑解决医学LLMs知识过时问题，支持批量编辑，在医学基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识快速更新和训练数据错误导致LLMs生成过时或不准确信息，限制了在临床实践中的应用。现有参数编辑方法损害局部性，检索式编辑面临表示重叠和批量编辑缺失的挑战。

Method: 构建MedVersa基准测试集，提出MedREK框架，整合共享查询-键模块进行精确匹配，使用基于注意力的提示编码器提供信息指导。

Result: 在各种医学基准测试中，MedREK在不同核心指标上均取得优异性能，为医学LLMs提供了首个经过验证的批量编辑解决方案。

Conclusion: MedREK框架有效解决了医学LLMs知识更新问题，支持批量编辑，在保持局部性的同时提升了编辑准确性。

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLM的注意力机制揭示了推理模式，提出了基于注意力信号的强化学习策略，实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的推理模式不透明，传统强化学习对整个生成过程采用统一信用分配，无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤。

Method: 区分局部和全局注意力头，提出窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响两个指标，发现预规划-锚定机制，并基于此设计三种针对性强化学习策略。

Result: 在多种推理任务上实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为结构感知的过程，为LLM推理的透明有效优化提供了可能路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，高资源语言与低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距，需要一种高效的方法来增强LLM在低资源语言上的能力。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，仅对这些神经元相关的权重进行目标语言数据的微调，形成专用的子网络。

Result: 在12种中低资源语言上的实验表明，该方法在性能上持续优于全参数微调、仅FFN微调、LoRA适配和随机子集微调基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为适应最先进模型到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的路径，同时发布了超过100种语言的语言特定神经元识别结果和适配流程。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试受到LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡的影响，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科动态收集表格数据，支持英语、德语、俄语和法语等多语言，实现领域平衡的基准测试生成。

Result: LLM从新收集表格生成的见解在自动指标上表现较差，但在LLM和人工评估中差异不明显；领域效应在所有评估中都很明显。

Conclusion: FreshTab能有效对抗数据污染问题，领域平衡的基准测试更具挑战性。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

TL;DR: NOSA是一个可训练的稀疏注意力框架，通过引入显式局部性约束来减少KV缓存传输，在保持训练时相同注意力计算的同时，显著提升解码吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理大小和解码吞吐量，特别是在大规模批量推理中。

Method: NOSA将令牌选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束来减少KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持近乎无损性能的同时，相比基线InfLLM-V2实现了高达2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA通过显式局部性约束有效解决了KV缓存卸载问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了解码效率。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoTime是一个记忆增强的时间知识图谱框架，通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习来增强LLM的时间推理能力，解决了多跳推理中的时间忠实性、多实体时间同步、适应不同时间操作符和重用先前推理经验等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间理解方面存在困难，特别是涉及多个实体、复合操作符和演化事件序列的问题。时间知识图谱虽然提供了结构化时间事实，但现有方法仍面临四个主要挑战：多跳推理的时间忠实性、多实体时间同步、适应不同时间操作符的检索以及重用先前推理经验。

Method: MemoTime将复杂时间问题分解为时间层次树，实现操作符感知推理，强制执行单调时间戳并在统一时间边界下共同约束多个实体。动态证据检索层自适应选择操作符特定的检索策略，自演进经验记忆存储已验证的推理轨迹、工具包决策和子问题嵌入以供跨类型重用。

Result: 在多个时间问答基准测试上的综合实验表明，MemoTime实现了整体最先进的结果，比强基线高出24.0%。此外，MemoTime使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习有效解决了时间推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了LLM的时间理解能力，并使较小模型也能达到大型模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

TL;DR: 该研究通过指令微调提升开源大语言模型在德语肿瘤诊断文本编码中的准确性，使用ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3编码标准，显著提高了编码准确率并减少了错误输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国肿瘤诊断的ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3准确编码对结构化癌症文档至关重要，但小型开源LLM在德语语境中编码准确性不足，需要改进。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了超过50万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调。

Result: ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率从较低水平提升至22-40%，畸形代码输出降至0%，肿瘤诊断识别率达到99%。

Conclusion: 利用公共目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的性能，模型大小与准确性正相关但微调后差距缩小，推理模式性能较低且速度慢100倍。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

TL;DR: 本文提出SALAD方法，通过跨模态蒸馏和针对性合成数据，用更少的语音数据缩小文本-语音理解差距，在3B和7B LLMs上取得与强开源模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音适应LLMs在语言理解任务上表现不如文本模型，存在文本-语音理解差距。现有方法依赖大规模语音合成或专有数据集，成本高且不可复现，需要更数据高效的方法。

Method: 提出SALAD方法：结合跨模态蒸馏和针对性合成数据，通过主动选择和学习来改善模态对齐，同时减轻遗忘问题。

Result: 在3B和7B LLMs上，SALAD使用比现有方法少一个数量级的公共语料库语音数据，在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准上取得了与强开源模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: SALAD通过分析文本-语音理解差距的两个驱动因素（遗忘和跨模态不对齐），提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小这一差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Method: 系统性地检查基于采样的解码对可检测性的影响，重点关注模型(子)词级分布的细微变化如何影响检测性能。

Result: 发现即使对温度、top-p或核采样等解码参数进行微小调整，也会严重损害检测器准确率，AUROC从接近完美水平降至1%。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在关键盲点，需要更全面的评估协议。为此发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，这是一个多维度的AI临床医生系统评估范式，涵盖认知深度(G)、答案完整性(A)、鲁棒性(P)和安全性(S)，并开发了全自动的基准构建流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI临床医生系统基准测试（如多选题考试或人工评分标准）无法捕捉真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 开发了全自动、指南锚定的流水线来构建GAPS对齐的基准，包括组装证据邻域、创建双图和树表示、自动生成跨G级别的问题，并使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准。

Result: 验证确认自动生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估最先进模型发现关键失败模式：随着推理深度增加性能急剧下降，模型在答案完整性方面表现不佳，对对抗性扰动和某些安全问题高度脆弱。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、临床基础的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全、更可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了四种聊天助手在事实核查行为中的表现，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个易产生错误信息主题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat四种助手。

Result: 发现不同助手之间存在差异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上更频繁引用非可信来源。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统比较了常用聊天助手的事实核查行为，为评估高风险信息环境中的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

*Zhiqi Huang,Vivek Datla,Chenyang Zhu,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu,Anoop Kumar,Ritesh Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前馈网络激活的置信度估计方法，用于检索增强生成系统，在金融客服场景中优于基线方法并保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、医疗等高风险领域，置信度估计对LLM输出的可靠性至关重要，错误答案的成本远高于不回答问题。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，避免投影和softmax归一化造成的信息损失；将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，使用Huber损失进行正则化训练。

Result: 在真实金融行业客服场景中，该方法优于强基线，在严格延迟约束下保持高精度；在Llama 3.1 8B模型上，仅使用第16层激活即可保持精度同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文通过机制性和因果分析框架，发现符号接地现象在语言模型的中间层计算中集中出现，通过注意力头聚合环境基础来支持语言形式预测，这种现象在多模态对话和不同架构中都能复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索符号接地在语言模型中的具体出现位置和驱动机制，现有研究虽然显示符号接地可能在大规模训练中自发出现，但其具体机制和位置仍不清楚。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制性和因果分析系统地追踪符号接地在内部计算中的出现过程，分析不同层级的计算机制。

Result: 发现接地现象集中在中间层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础实现，这种现象在Transformer和状态空间模型中都能复现，但在单向LSTM中无法出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可以在语言模型中自发出现，这对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

*Giovanni Monea,Yair Feldman,Shankar Padmanabhan,Kianté Brantley,Yoav Artzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过训练模型定期压缩生成KV缓存的方法，使用学习到的专用令牌来压缩并清除缓存条目，以解决长上下文推理中KV缓存线性增长带来的内存和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的限制，这会带来显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理令牌，过去生成令牌的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型定期压缩生成KV缓存，使用学习到的专用令牌压缩缓存条目并清除已压缩的条目。该方法利用强化学习输出来进行蒸馏，最小化传统强化学习过程的开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确率帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练的压缩技术，实现了更优的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的KV缓存压缩方法通过训练模型智能压缩缓存，有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存和计算瓶颈，在保持准确率的同时显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级压缩器，能够从检索到的文档中提取相关证据并生成简洁摘要，用于增强检索增强生成(RAG)系统，特别是在处理复杂多跳问题时有效减少上下文长度和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务，扩展的上下文虽然提供更丰富信息，但带来了更高的延迟和模型认知负担。需要解决这一瓶颈，特别是针对复杂多跳问题。

Method: 使用相对较短的上下文（少于1k词）作为种子数据，训练BRIEF-Pro对超过10k词的扩展上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升了小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩性能提升4.67%，计算开销仅需23%。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一个通用轻量级压缩器，能够有效压缩扩展上下文，提高RAG系统性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

Abstract: Cellular wireless networks enable mobile broadband connectivity for
Internet-based applications through their radio access and core network
infrastructure. While Fifth-Generation (5G) cellular systems are currently
being deployed, ongoing research on cellular technologies primarily focuses on
Sixth-Generation (6G) networks to set the stage for developing standards for
these systems. Therefore, the time has come to articulate the visions for
beyond 6G (B6G) systems. In this article, we present a visionary framework
toward hyper-dimensional connectivity in B6G that enables wireless access to
hyper-immersive Internet technologies. Our contributions include a conceptual
framework for B6G cellular systems with jointly integrated communication,
cognition, computing, and cyber-physical capabilities as core connectivity
dimensions, a set of technical definitions outlining potential use cases and
system-level requirements, a mapping of prospective technology enablers, and a
forward-looking research agenda for B6G systems. The conceptual discussions in
this article would be helpful for identifying innovation drivers, shaping
long-term technical goals, and defining research agendas for the future of
mobile broadband technologies.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合可解释机器学习和因果推断的框架，用于管理O-RAN架构中xApp之间的控制冲突，通过因果图识别冲突并量化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN架构中多个xApp的并发操作可能导致控制动作冲突，造成网络性能下降，需要有效管理这些冲突。

Method: 使用SHAP等可解释性工具识别共同影响同一KPI的RAN控制参数，构建因果有向无环图，并通过ATE和CATE等指标估计因果影响。

Result: 该框架能够识别xApp之间的潜在冲突，并量化这些冲突对网络性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为网络运营商提供了识别冲突和量化影响的指导性见解，支持更明智有效的冲突解决策略。

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables a flexible,
vendor-neutral deployment of 5G networks by disaggregating base station
components and supporting third-party xApps for near real-time RAN control.
However, the concurrent operation of multiple xApps can lead to conflicting
control actions, which may cause network performance degradation. In this work,
we propose a framework for xApp conflict management that combines explainable
machine learning and causal inference to evaluate the causal relationships
between RAN Control Parameters (RCPs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We
use model explainability tools such as SHAP to identify RCPs that jointly
affect the same KPI, signaling potential conflicts, and represent these
interactions as a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then estimate the
causal impact of each of these RCPs on their associated KPIs using metrics such
as Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect
(CATE). This approach offers network operators guided insights into identifying
conflicts and quantifying their impacts, enabling more informed and effective
conflict resolution strategies across diverse xApp deployments.

TL;DR: NeTestLLM是一个基于多智能体大语言模型的端到端自动化网络协议测试系统，通过分层协议理解、迭代测试用例生成和运行时反馈分析，显著提高了测试效率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络协议测试方法劳动密集且易出错，每个测试用例需要1人天工作量。现有基于模型的方法虽然提供部分自动化，但仍需要大量人工建模和专家干预，成本高且难以适应多样化和不断演进的协议。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM进行分层协议理解捕获复杂规范，迭代生成测试用例提高覆盖率，使用特定任务工作流生成可执行工件，并通过运行时反馈分析进行调试和优化。

Result: 在实验中为OSPF、RIP和BGP生成了4,632个测试用例，覆盖了41个历史FRRouting bug（国家标准仅覆盖11个）。生成可执行工件的测试效率比手动方法提高了8.65倍。

Conclusion: NeTestLLM为异构网络协议的自动化端到端测试提供了首个实用的LLM驱动解决方案，已在生产环境中部署数月并获得领域专家积极反馈。

Abstract: Network protocol testing is fundamental for modern network infrastructure.
However, traditional network protocol testing methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, requiring manual interpretation of specifications, test case
design, and translation into executable artifacts, typically demanding one
person-day of effort per test case. Existing model-based approaches provide
partial automation but still involve substantial manual modeling and expert
intervention, leading to high costs and limited adaptability to diverse and
evolving protocols. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind system called
NeTestLLM that takes advantage of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) for
end-to-end automated network protocol testing. NeTestLLM employs hierarchical
protocol understanding to capture complex specifications, iterative test case
generation to improve coverage, a task-specific workflow for executable
artifact generation, and runtime feedback analysis for debugging and
refinement. NeTestLLM has been deployed in a production environment for several
months, receiving positive feedback from domain experts. In experiments,
NeTestLLM generated 4,632 test cases for OSPF, RIP, and BGP, covering 41
historical FRRouting bugs compared to 11 by current national standards. The
process of generating executable artifacts also improves testing efficiency by
a factor of 8.65x compared to manual methods. NeTestLLM provides the first
practical LLM-powered solution for automated end-to-end testing of
heterogeneous network protocols.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NetMCP平台和SONAR算法，通过增强MCP工具路由算法的实时网络感知能力，解决了当前LLM扩展功能中仅依赖语义匹配导致的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM扩展功能仅依赖语义匹配，在延迟波动或服务器故障时表现脆弱，需要增强网络和服务状态的实时感知能力。

Method: 构建了NetMCP异构实验平台，提供五种代表性网络状态，并提出SONAR算法，联合优化语义相似度和网络QoS指标进行自适应工具路由。

Result: SONAR相比仅语义匹配和基于LLM的基线方法，持续提高了任务成功率，减少了完成时间和失败次数。

Conclusion: 网络感知设计对于生产规模的LLM系统具有重要价值，NetMCP平台为相关研究和开发提供了可控测试环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain static in functionality after training,
and extending their capabilities requires integration with external data,
computation, and services. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a
standard interface for such extensions, but current implementations rely solely
on semantic matching between users' requests and server function descriptions,
which makes current deployments and simulation testbeds fragile under latency
fluctuations or server failures. We address this gap by enhancing MCP tool
routing algorithms with real-time awareness of network and server status. To
provide a controlled test environment for development and evaluation, we
construct a heterogeneous experimental platform, namely Network-aware MCP
(NetMCP), which offers five representative network states and build a benchmark
for latency sequence generation and MCP server datasets. On top of NetMCP
platform, we analyze latency sequences and propose a Semantic-Oriented and
Network-Aware Routing (SONAR) algorithm, which jointly optimizes semantic
similarity and network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for adaptive tool
routing. Results show that SONAR consistently improves task success rate and
reduces completion time and failure number compared with semantic-only,
LLM-based baselines, demonstrating the value of network-aware design for
production-scale LLM systems. The code for NetMCP is available at

TL;DR: Tommy系统通过概率模型比较噪声时间戳，提出likely-happened-before关系来实现公平排序，而非消除时钟误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件公平排序问题，传统方法受限于时钟同步精度，需要新方法来处理时钟变异性。

Method: 使用统计模型学习每个时钟的偏移分布，概率性地比较两个噪声时间戳，建立likely-happened-before关系。

Result: 提出了新的likely-happened-before关系，为原本在happened-before关系中并发的事件提供排序基础。

Conclusion: 拥抱时钟变异性而非消除它，为公平排序提供了新方向，但面临intransitivity等挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: A growing class of applications demands \emph{fair ordering/sequencing} of
events which ensures that events generated earlier by one client are processed
before later events from other clients. However, achieving such sequencing is
fundamentally challenging due to the inherent limitations of clock
synchronization. We advocate for an approach that embraces, rather than
eliminates, clock variability. Instead of attempting to remove error from a
timestamp, Tommy, our proposed system, leverages a statistical model to compare
two noisy timestamps probabilistically by learning per-clock offset
distributions. Our preliminary statistical model computes the probability that
one event precedes another w.r.t. the wall-clock time without access to the
wall-clock. This serves as a foundation for a new relation:
\emph{likely-happened-before} denoted by $\xrightarrow{p}$ where $p$ represents
the probability of an event to have happened before another. The
$\xrightarrow{p}$ relation provides a basis for ordering multiple events which
are otherwise considered \emph{concurrent} by the typical
\emph{happened-before} ($\rightarrow$) relation. We highlight various related
challenges including intransitivity of $\xrightarrow{p}$ relation as opposed to
the transitive $\rightarrow$ relation. We also outline several research
directions: online fair sequencing, stochastically fair total ordering,
host-level support for fairness and more.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信为偏远地区提供互联网连接，但传输成本远高于传统互联网，需要降低内容传输成本。

Method: 在卫星网络中放置内容副本服务器，考虑卫星移动轨迹，优化客户端性能和卫星间内容传输成本。

Result: 使用模拟流量轨迹和原型系统验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效优化卫星网络中的内容传输性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Satellite communication offers Internet connectivity to remote locations,
such as villages, deserts, mountains, and at sea. However, transmitting content
over satellite networks is significantly more expensive than traditional
Internet. To address this issue, we propose placing content replica servers
within satellite networks and optimizing replica placement for important
performance metrics, such as latency, transmission, and storage cost. Our
approach can support different types of satellite networks, including Low Earth
Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and their
combinations. An important challenge for supporting content replicas in such
networks is that LEO and MEO satellites are constantly moving. We address this
challenge by explicitly considering their moving trajectories and strategically
optimizing not only client performance, but also the cost of transferring
content from one satellite to another as needed. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using both simulated traffic traces and a
prototype system.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面测量了Starlink卫星互联网在PoP、DNS和CDN层面的网页内容交付性能，发现基础设施密度决定性能表现，卫星覆盖并非主要影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星互联网承诺提供全球连接，但其与内容交付系统的交互机制尚不明确，需要深入理解卫星架构如何影响传统CDN假设。

Method: 通过两年测量，结合22.5万次Cloudflare AIM测试、M-Lab数据和来自99个RIPE Atlas及受控Starlink探针的主动探测，收集610万条追踪路由和1080万次DNS查询。

Result: 识别出三种性能模式：有本地内容丰富PoP的地区接近地面网络延迟；基础设施稀疏地区因远程PoP导致CDN定位错误，延迟超过200ms；密集基础设施地区对PoP变化不敏感。利用2025年初Starlink基础设施扩展实验，证明将PoP移近用户可将页面获取时间中位数减少60%。

Conclusion: 基础设施邻近性而非卫星覆盖影响网页性能，需要从根本上改变卫星ISP的CDN映射和DNS解析机制。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite ISPs promise universal Internet connectivity,
yet their interaction with content delivery remains poorly understood. We
present the first comprehensive measurement study decomposing Starlink's web
content delivery performance decomposed across Point of Presence (PoP), DNS,
and CDN layers. Through two years of measurements combining 225K Cloudflare AIM
tests, M-Lab data, and active probing from 99 RIPE Atlas and controlled
Starlink probes, we collect 6.1M traceroutes and 10.8M DNS queries to quantify
how satellite architecture disrupts terrestrial CDN assumptions. We identify
three distinct performance regimes based on infrastructure density. Regions
with local content-rich PoPs achieve near-terrestrial latencies with the
satellite segment dominating 80-90% of RTT. Infrastructure-sparse regions
suffer cascading penalties: remote PoPs force distant resolver selection, which
triggers CDN mis-localization, pushing latencies beyond 200 ms.
Dense-infrastructure regions show minimal sensitivity to PoP changes.
Leveraging Starlink's infrastructure expansion in early 2025 as a natural
experiment, we demonstrate that relocating PoPs closer to user location reduces
median page-fetch times by 60%. Our findings reveal that infrastructure
proximity, not satellite coverage, influences web performance, requiring
fundamental changes to CDN mapping and DNS resolution for satellite ISPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 导频污染是分布式大规模MIMO系统实现其全部潜力的主要瓶颈，需要设计实用的导频分配策略来改善信道估计质量并减少干扰。

Method: 1. 低复杂度集中式算法：顺序分配导频给用户设备以最小化全局信道估计误差；2. 完全分布式算法：基于优先级的导频选择方法，每个接入点使用本地信息最小化估计误差，用户设备根据接入点优先级选择合适的导频。

Result: 数值仿真表明，所提出的方案在网络吞吐量方面优于其他最先进的基准方案，显著减少了导频污染。

Conclusion: 提出的集中式和分布式导频分配策略能有效减轻导频污染，提高信道估计质量，减少干扰，且分布式方法无需全局协调，保持了低信令开销并动态适应用户部署。

Abstract: Pilot contamination remains a major bottleneck in realizing the full
potential of distributed massive MIMO systems. We propose two dynamic and
scalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such
networks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that
sequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global
channel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the
channel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the
spectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses
a priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP
minimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate
pilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority.
This approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while
significantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global
coordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the
UE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other
state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoCode是一个使用多轮验证生成竞赛级编程问题陈述和测试用例的系统，在保留问题上测试套件与官方评判的一致性接近99%，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编写竞争性编程问题需要精确设置约束条件、输入分布和边界情况，排除捷径，针对特定算法，并校准超出大多数参赛者能力范围的复杂度，这成为测试大型语言模型通用能力的理想场景。

Method: AutoCode使用多轮验证生成问题陈述和测试用例，从随机种子问题创建新颖变体并提供参考和暴力解决方案，通过交叉验证这些生成的解决方案与测试用例来过滤掉格式错误的问题。

Result: 在保留问题上，AutoCode测试套件与官方评判的一致性接近99%，显著优于HardTests等现有方法（低于81%）。系统成功生成了被特级大师级（前0.3%）竞争程序员评为具有竞赛质量的新颖问题。

Conclusion: AutoCode能够可靠地生成高质量的竞争性编程问题，通过人类专家验证确保高正确性，为测试大型语言模型能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set
constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts;
target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data
structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We
argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model
capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce
AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade
problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites
approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement
over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than
81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create
novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying
these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out
malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human
experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by
Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

TL;DR: 本文证明在大型代码库中使用关键词搜索足以检索相关代码上下文，无需GPU资源，在代码上下文竞赛中达到0.748和0.725 chRF分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成框架通常使用语义搜索，需要大量计算资源训练和托管嵌入模型，难以集成到轻量级应用中。

Method: 使用关键词搜索替代语义搜索来检索相关代码上下文，避免对GPU资源的依赖。

Result: 在代码上下文竞赛基准测试中，Kotlin和Python赛道分别达到0.748和0.725 chRF分数，证明关键词搜索的有效性。

Conclusion: 关键词搜索足以在大型代码库中检索相关有用的代码上下文，无需昂贵的GPU资源，适合轻量级应用集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to enhance Code Language
Models (CLMs) by including another module for retrieving relevant context to
construct the input prompt. However, these retrieval modules commonly use
semantic search, requiring substantial computational resources for training and
hosting these embedded models, making them infeasible to integrate into
lightweight applications such as in-IDE AI-based code completion. In this
solution paper, we prove that using keyword-search is sufficient to retrieve
relevant and useful code context inside large codebases, without the need for
extensive GPU resources. The usefulness of code contexts found by our solution
is demonstrated through their completion results on the Code Context
Competition's benchmark, reaching 0.748 and 0.725 chRF scores on Kotlin and
Python tracks, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ADPerf工具，用于生成逼真的点云数据测试用例，以暴露自动驾驶系统中障碍物检测模块的延迟增加问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的障碍物检测延迟对安全性至关重要，但目前对其延迟特性及对点云数据变化的弹性理解不足。

Method: 首先对Apollo和Autoware两个工业级自动驾驶系统进行障碍物检测性能测量和建模，然后开发ADPerf工具生成测试用例来暴露延迟问题。

Result: 评估显示3D障碍物检测模块可能成为自动驾驶系统延迟的主要瓶颈，且这种负面影响会传播到其他模块（如轨迹预测）。

Conclusion: 需要进行障碍物检测组件的性能测试，特别是3D障碍物检测，因为其延迟增加会降低自动驾驶系统的整体可靠性。

Abstract: Obstacle detection is crucial to the operation of autonomous driving systems,
which rely on multiple sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, combined with code
logic and deep learning models to detect obstacles for time-sensitive
decisions. Consequently, obstacle detection latency is critical to the safety
and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the latency of the
obstacle detection module and its resilience to various changes in the LiDAR
point cloud data are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present the
first comprehensive investigation on measuring and modeling the performance of
the obstacle detection modules in two industry-grade autonomous driving
systems, i.e., Apollo and Autoware. Learning from this investigation, we
introduce ADPerf, a tool that aims to generate realistic point cloud data test
cases that can expose increased detection latency. Increasing latency decreases
the availability of the detected obstacles and stresses the capabilities of
subsequent modules in autonomous driving systems, i.e., the modules may be
negatively impacted by the increased latency in obstacle detection.
  We applied ADPerf to stress-test the performance of widely used 3D obstacle
detection modules in autonomous driving systems, as well as the propagation of
such tests on trajectory prediction modules. Our evaluation highlights the need
to conduct performance testing of obstacle detection components, especially 3D
obstacle detection, as they can be a major bottleneck to increased latency of
the autonomous driving system. Such an adverse outcome will also further
propagate to other modules, reducing the overall reliability of autonomous
driving systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP应用中的普及，其可信度问题（特别是安全性和鲁棒性）日益突出，需要系统化的评估框架来确保模型可靠性。

Method: 开发TRUSTVIS自动化评估框架，集成AutoDAN等知名扰动方法，采用多数投票机制，并提供交互式可视化界面展示可信度指标。

Result: 在Vicuna-7b、Llama2-7b和GPT-3.5等模型上的初步案例研究表明，该框架能有效识别安全性和鲁棒性漏洞。

Conclusion: TRUSTVIS不仅提供可靠的可信度评估结果，还通过直观的可视化界面使复杂评估过程易于理解，支持用户进行针对性的模型改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness
persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we
introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a
comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework
is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations
of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like
AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods,
TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation
processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like
Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the
interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering
targeted model improvements. Video Link: https://youtu.be/k1TrBqNVg8g

### [189] [Isolating Compiler Bugs through Compilation Steps Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13128)
*Yujie Liu,Mingxuan Zhu,Shengyu Cheng,Dan Hao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CompSCAN是一种新颖的编译器bug隔离技术，通过分析编译步骤序列来识别bug原因，在真实LLVM和GCC bug上表现优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug会传播到依赖软件中，确保编译器正确性至关重要。现有技术主要通过变异编译输入生成测试用例，但缺乏对内部步骤的因果分析，限制了其有效性。

Method: CompSCAN采用三阶段过程：(1)提取导致原始失败的编译步骤序列；(2)识别bug导致步骤并收集对应的编译器代码元素；(3)计算每个代码元素的可疑度并输出可疑排名列表。

Result: 在185个真实LLVM和GCC bug上评估，CompSCAN在Top-1/3/5/10排名中分别成功隔离50、85、100和123个bug，相比ETEM和ODFL分别有44.51%/50.18%/36.24%/24.49%和31.58%/49.12%/44.93%/21.78%的相对改进，且运行速度更快。

Conclusion: CompSCAN通过分析编译步骤序列有效隔离编译器bug，在效果和效率上都优于现有技术，为编译器bug定位提供了新方法。

Abstract: Compilers are essential to software systems, and their bugs can propagate to
dependent software. Ensuring compiler correctness is critical. However,
isolating compiler bugs remains challenging due to the internal complexity of
compiler execution. Existing techniques primarily mutate compilation inputs to
generate passing and failing tests, but often lack causal analysis of internal
steps, limiting their effectiveness.
  To address this limitation, we propose CompSCAN, a novel compiler bug
isolation technique that applies analysis over the sequence of compilation
steps. CompSCAN follows a three-stage process: (1) extracting the array of
compilation steps that leads to the original failure, (2) identifying
bug-causing steps and collecting corresponding compiler code elements, and (3)
calculating suspicious scores for each code element and outputting a suspicious
ranking list as the bug isolation result.
  We evaluate CompSCAN on 185 real-world LLVM and GCC bugs. Results show that
CompSCAN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both effectiveness and
efficiency. CompSCAN successfully isolates 50, 85, 100, and 123 bugs within the
Top-1/3/5/10 ranks, respectively. Compared with ETEM and ODFL, two
state-of-the-art compiler bug isolation techniques, CompSCAN achieves relative
improvements of 44.51% / 50.18% / 36.24% / 24.49% over ETEM, and 31.58% /
49.12% / 44.93% / 21.78% over ODFL on those metrics. Moreover, CompSCAN runs
faster on average per bug than both baselines.

*Haolin Pan,Chao Zha,Jinyuan Dong,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRACE是一个用于编译器自动调优的新框架，通过利用pass协同效应和对比学习来减少搜索空间，生成专门的pass序列，在LLVM IR指令数优化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器pass选择和阶段排序对程序性能优化至关重要，但标准启发式方法通常产生次优结果，迭代编译搜索成本过高，机器学习方法泛化能力不足。

Method: GRACE通过pass协同效应和加权评分生成高质量候选序列和pass池，使用对比学习和数据增强创建程序嵌入，通过聚类和进化搜索生成专门的pass序列核心集。

Result: 在7个不同数据集上，GRACE相比opt -Oz平均减少LLVM IR指令数10.09%(LLVM 10.0.0)和10.19%(LLVM 18.1.6)，平均调优时间低于1秒/程序。

Conclusion: GRACE在编译器自动调优方面实现了最先进的性能和实际有效性，显著减少了指令数同时保持较低的调优开销。

Abstract: Compiler pass selection and phase ordering present a significant challenge in
achieving optimal program performance, particularly for objectives like code
size reduction. Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but
often yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all
nature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its
prohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches
promise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen
programs. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler
auto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE
effectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a
weighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences
and a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass
sequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate
similarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a
coreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to
unseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset
sequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on
seven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an
average of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz,
while incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对LLVM新Pass Manager的自动调优框架，使用形式化语法定义有效嵌套流水线空间，通过基于森林的数据结构和结构感知遗传算法确保生成语法有效的优化流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编译器自动调优方法假设线性pass序列，这与LLVM新Pass Manager的分层设计不匹配，无法保证生成语法有效的优化流水线。

Method: 使用形式化语法定义有效嵌套流水线空间，开发基于森林的数据结构和结构感知遗传算法，直接操作森林结构确保候选解的有效性，并通过挖掘协同pass关系和可选细化阶段来指导搜索。

Result: 在LLVM 18.1.6上对7个基准数据集进行评估，发现的流水线相比标准opt -Oz优化级别平均额外减少13.62%的指令计数。

Conclusion: 该框架能够导航复杂约束的搜索空间，识别出有效且高效的pass流水线，证明了其在新Pass Manager环境下的有效性。

Abstract: Compiler optimization relies on sequences of passes to improve program
performance. Selecting and ordering these passes automatically, known as
compiler auto-tuning, is challenging due to the large and complex search space.
Existing approaches generally assume a linear sequence of passes, a model
compatible with legacy compilers but fundamentally misaligned with the
hierarchical design of the LLVM New Pass Manager. This misalignment prevents
them from guaranteeing the generation of syntactically valid optimization
pipelines. In this work, we present a new auto-tuning framework built from the
ground up for the New Pass Manager. We introduce a formal grammar to define the
space of valid nested pipelines and a forest-based data structure for their
native representation. Upon this foundation, we develop a structure-aware
Genetic Algorithm whose operators manipulate these forests directly, ensuring
that all candidate solutions are valid by construction. The framework first
mines synergistic pass relationships to guide the search. An optional
refinement stage further explores subtle performance variations arising from
different valid structural arrangements.
  We evaluate our approach on seven benchmark datasets using LLVM 18.1.6. The
discovered pipelines achieve an average of 13.62% additional instruction count
reduction compared to the standard opt -Oz optimization level, showing that our
framework is capable of navigating this complex, constrained search space to
identify valid and effective pass pipelines.

Motivation: 现有的编程语言和形式化方法验证技术在处理真实科学计算应用时面临困难，主要原因是科学计算社区与PL/FM社区之间缺乏对机器可验证正确性挑战的共同理解。

Method: 提出为科学计算开发专门的挑战问题，这些挑战旨在补充PL/FM研究人员研究的一般程序问题，确保满足科学计算应用的需求。

Result: 提出了科学计算中相关的多个正确性维度，并讨论了设计评估科学计算正确性挑战问题的指导原则和标准。

Conclusion: 通过专门的挑战问题可以更好地指导和评估PL/FM验证技术在科学计算正确性方面的开发，促进两个社区之间的合作与理解。

Abstract: Correctness in scientific computing (SC) is gaining increasing attention in
the formal methods (FM) and programming languages (PL) community. Existing
PL/FM verification techniques struggle with the complexities of realistic SC
applications. Part of the problem is a lack of a common understanding between
the SC and PL/FM communities of machine-verifiable correctness challenges and
dimensions of correctness in SC applications.
  To address this gap, we call for specialized challenge problems to inform the
development and evaluation of FM/PL verification techniques for correctness in
SC. These specialized challenges are intended to augment existing problems
studied by FM/PL researchers for general programs to ensure the needs of SC
applications can be met. We propose several dimensions of correctness relevant
to scientific computing, and discuss some guidelines and criteria for designing
challenge problems to evaluate correctness in scientific computing.

Conclusion: OpenDerisk成功填补了SRE领域AI自动化解决方案的空白，提供了一个专门化、开源的多智能体框架，能够有效应对复杂软件系统的诊断挑战。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern software imposes an unsustainable
operational burden on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, demanding
AI-driven automation that can emulate expert diagnostic reasoning. Existing

architected for SRE. OpenDerisk integrates a diagnostic-native collaboration
model, a pluggable reasoning engine, a knowledge engine, and a standardized
protocol (MCP) to enable specialist agents to collectively solve complex,
multi-domain problems. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
OpenDerisk significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
accuracy and efficiency. This effectiveness is validated by its large-scale

Motivation: 工业嵌入式系统的软硬件协同开发在持续集成中经常出现编译错误，现有修复技术依赖测试用例，但不可编译代码无法获得测试用例。

Method: 采用基于大型语言模型的自动修复方法，收集了4万多个产品源代码提交，评估了四种先进LLM在工业CI系统中的性能，并与人工修复对比。

Result: LLM增强的CI系统能解决基线数据集中63%的编译错误，成功CI构建的修复方案中83%是合理的，调试时间显著减少至8分钟内。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在工业CI系统中能有效自动修复编译错误，大幅提高开发效率。

Abstract: The co-development of hardware and software in industrial embedded systems
frequently leads to compilation errors during continuous integration (CI).
Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on
test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code.
  We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large
language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000
commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an
industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their
outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI
systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline
dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed
reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the
majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours
typically required for manual debugging.

Abstract: I take inspiration from the property-testing literature, particularly the
work of Prof. John Hughes, and explore how such ideas might be applied to
numerical models of the ocean. Specifically, I ask whether geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD) theory, expressed as property tests, might be used to address
the oracle problem of testing the correctness of ocean models. I propose that a
number of simple idealized GFD problems can be framed as property tests. These
examples clearly illustrate how physics naturally lends itself to specifying
property tests. Which of these proposed tests might be most feasible and
useful, remains to be seen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究仓库级预训练如何提升代码大模型利用代码库上下文的能力，以生成更准确和上下文感知的代码补全。

Method: 将OpenCoder模型的上下文窗口从4,096扩展到16,384个token，在额外10亿token的仓库级数据上训练，比较不同仓库处理策略的效果。

Result: 尽管使用比竞争模型更小的数据集，该模型在Long Code Arena基准测试中实现了相当的性能，发现不同仓库处理技术效果相似，主要收益来自适应新的RoPE缩放参数。

Conclusion: 更简单的文件级训练方法在原始序列长度下仍然非常有效，为数据计算资源受限环境下的仓库级代码补全研究开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Repository-level pretraining is commonly used to enable large language models
for code to leverage codebase-wide context. This enhances their ability to
generate accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we
investigate how different repository-processing strategies affect in-context
learning in OpenCoder, a 1.5B-parameter model. We extend its context window
from 4,096 to 16,384 tokens by training on additional 1B tokens of curated
repository-level data. Despite relying on a smaller dataset than competing
models (which often use hundreds of billions of tokens), our model achieves
comparable performance on the Long Code Arena benchmark. We find that various
repository-processing techniques yield similarly strong results, with the
primary gain coming from adapting to a new rotary positional embedding (RoPE)
scaling parameter. Finally, we show that a simpler file-level training approach
at the original sequence length remains highly effective, opening up
repository-level code completion research to settings with more constrained
data and compute resources.

TL;DR: 尽管女性在心理学等社会科学领域占多数，但在高级职位中代表性不足。研究发现女性在职业生涯早期流失率更高，学术表现（特别是第一作者论文）对早期职业保留的影响最大。即使在控制各种因素后，女性仍更可能离开学术界，表明存在持续性障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查社会科学领域"泄漏管道"现象——尽管女性在入门级占多数，但在高级职位中代表性不足的问题，探究女性在学术生涯中流失的原因。

Method: 使用大规模文献计量数据分析了78,216名心理学研究人员的职业轨迹，比较了性别在职业保留率、学术表现、合作网络和机构环境等方面的差异。

Result: 女性在职业生涯早期流失率显著高于男性，特别是在首次发表后的前几年。学术表现（尤其是第一作者论文）对早期职业保留的影响最大，超过合作网络或机构环境。即使在控制出版、合作和机构层面因素后，女性仍更可能离开学术界。

Conclusion: 心理学及其他社会科学领域的核心挑战在于保留而非招聘，需要有针对性的早期职业干预措施来促进长期性别平等。

Abstract: Although more women than men enter social science disciplines, they are
underrepresented at senior levels. To investigate this leaky pipeline, this
study analyzed the career trajectories of 78,216 psychology researchers using
large-scale bibliometric data. Despite overall constituting over 60\% of these
researchers, women experienced consistently higher attrition rates than men,
particularly in the early years following their first publication. Academic
performance, particularly first-authored publications, was strongly associated
with early-career retention -- more so than collaboration networks or
institutional environment. After controlling for gender differences in
publication-, collaboration-, and institution-level factors, women remained
more likely to leave academia, especially in early-career stages, pointing to
persistent barriers that hinder women's academic careers. These findings
suggest that in psychology and potentially other social science disciplines,
the core challenge lies in retention rather than recruitment, underscoring the
need for targeted, early-career interventions to promote long-term gender
equity.

Conclusion: RID框架为从字面指令遵循转向目标导向推理提供了实用、可访问且有效的方法，为更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过基于熵的令牌级优势塑造和选择性加权的样本级优势，有效增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现，在标准强化学习下，规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架，通过基于熵的令牌级优势塑造为高熵令牌分配更大更新，并选择性加权规划密集型rollouts的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试中，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效解决了现有方法在规划能力优化方面的不足，为复杂任务的长期规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化方法评估LLM具身智能体物理安全性的框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证，使用时序逻辑精确描述安全需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观LLM判断，缺乏对LLM具身智能体物理安全的系统性形式化评估方法。

Method: 采用多级验证管道：语义层将自然语言安全需求形式化为时序逻辑公式；规划层验证LLM生成的高层行动计划；轨迹层合并执行轨迹为计算树进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现先前方法忽略的安全违规，揭示失败模式。

Conclusion: 通过时序逻辑形式化物理安全需求并在多层级应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

Motivation: 两车事故占道路事故70%，但手动标注驾驶员危险行为存在不一致性和劳动密集问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高数据可靠性和分析效率。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车事故数据，微调Llama 3.2 1B模型处理事故叙述，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等基准模型对比。

Result: 微调LLM总体准确率80%，优于所有基准模型，在数据不平衡场景表现更佳。概率推理分析显示：驾驶员分心会增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率，双方分心时"双方危险行为"概率最高，青少年驾驶会显著增加"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析与LLMs重新构想为推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非仅依赖数值回归能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列分析需要超越表面趋势，理解驱动变化的实际力量。现有LLM方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力，仅使用数值回归能力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，整合多模态输入，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 该方法使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间序列分析中的有效应用应侧重于推理能力，而非数值回归，以实现更透明和上下文感知的分析。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了基于偏好的奖励修复（PBRR）框架，通过从人类偏好中学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，从而解决奖励函数与真实目标不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的强化学习奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不匹配，导致奖励黑客问题；而从零开始学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架通过目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，识别关键状态转移并学习加性修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格领域证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好强化学习方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从零学习奖励函数或使用其他方法修改代理奖励函数的基线方法，且需要更少的偏好数据。

Conclusion: PBRR能够有效解决奖励函数不匹配问题，通过少量偏好数据即可修复代理奖励函数，获得高性能策略。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Result: 实验表明，采用该框架的智能体不仅表现出与情感状态一致的行为，在与其他类型智能体的比较评估中展现出更优的生态效度，决策结果更接近人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 该情感认知框架有效解决了LLM智能体在情感认知方面的局限性，为构建更真实的社会模拟提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，仅在答案错误时进行深度推理，实现计算资源的优化分配。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统有效平衡了计算效率与推理精度，为LLM的实际应用提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Conclusion: EvoTest提供了一种无需梯度计算的进化方法，有效解决了AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能的挑战，在J-TTL基准上表现出色。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Conclusion: SAJA框架有效利用了状态和动作攻击的协同效应，为多智能体深度强化学习的对抗鲁棒性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在隐式因果链发现任务中的机制性因果推理能力，发现LLMs主要通过关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理来生成因果步骤，但生成的链条在逻辑上具有一致性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系，以及它们能否发现连接原因和结果之间的中间因果步骤，特别是在论证场景中进行机制性因果推理。

Method: 使用九个大型语言模型，要求它们为给定的原因-结果对生成所有可能的中间因果步骤，这些配对来自气候变化辩论的论证研究资源，并在诊断评估框架中进行分析。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然它们对中间因果连接具有自我一致性和信心，但主要基于关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成链条的逻辑连贯性和完整性。

Conclusion: 研究为推进论证场景中隐式机制性因果推理的未来工作提供了基准因果链发现方法、诊断评估见解和带有因果链的基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

### [214] [Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13501)
*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而无训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge利用LLM内在推理能力评估响应。模型置信度可作为有效奖励指标，但这一概念尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 系统研究CRew方法，使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理，特别适用于封闭式任务。通过数学推理任务实验验证其有效性，并提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度分数和正确性信号构建偏好数据。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有无训练奖励方法，甚至超越大多数训练过的奖励模型。发现CRew分数与模型实际推理性能强相关，并能有效筛选高质量训练数据。CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的无训练奖励方法，置信度可作为有效的奖励信号。CRew-DPO训练策略能进一步提升模型性能，为LLM推理能力增强提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 生成式AI在金融服务行业应用时，传统机器学习指标无法很好适应，而广泛使用的基准测试也难以推广到工业应用，需要解决模型性能评估的障碍。

Method: 开发了一个风险评估框架，结合领域专家评估和机器学习指标，以更好地应用这些评估方法。

Result: 提出了一个能够应对生成式AI在金融服务中独特风险的综合评估框架。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

*Robert West,Ashton Anderson,Ece Kamar,Eric Horvitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为"串联训练"的强化学习方法，通过随机切换强弱模型来鼓励强模型产生弱模型也能理解的解决方案，从而提高AI系统的可解释性和协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的快速发展，其推理过程对较弱代理和人类来说越来越难以理解，这削弱了可解释性和监督能力。论文旨在开发方法使强模型产生的解决方案对较弱合作者保持可理解性。

Method: 提出了串联训练方法：在强化学习训练过程中，随机从冻结的弱模型中采样token而不是从正在训练的强模型中采样。只有当强模型的行为和推理过程能够被弱模型继续时，整个解决方案才能成功。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，串联训练可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，适应较弱合作伙伴的语言，同时保持任务准确性。

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建可由较弱代理审计的AI系统提供了一条有前景的途径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于逻辑的模型可用于构建法律领域机器学习分类器的验证工具，这些分类器基于先前案例预测新案件结果，执行案例推理。

Method: 引入分类器模态逻辑，将案件时间维度和法院层级系统纳入逻辑框架，以解决先例之间的冲突。

Result: 开发了一个能够正式捕捉法律案例推理的逻辑框架，包含处理先例冲突的原则。

Conclusion: 该逻辑框架为验证法律机器学习分类器提供了形式化基础，能够处理复杂的法律推理场景。

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大化人类赋权（empowerment）的辅助语言模型调优方法Empower，该方法仅需离线文本数据，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励，就能训练出更好的辅助AI助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建辅助代理的方法（模仿专家或RL微调）往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正辅助人类实现目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。需要一种更有效且成本更低的辅助AI训练方法。

Method: Empower方法基于最大化人类赋权（在环境中实现期望变化的能力），仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督微调，无需额外人工反馈。

Result: 18人用户研究显示，参与者78%的时间偏好Empower助手（p=0.015），接受率提高31%，建议减少38%。在模拟编程环境中，Empower训练代理使模拟程序员在挑战性编程问题上的成功率平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个框架，仅使用离线数据就能大规模构建有用且对齐的AI代理，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Method: 将AI代理安全建模为序列决策问题，基于AI模型的世界潜在表示构建预测性护栏，实时监控输出并主动修正风险输出为安全输出，采用安全关键强化学习进行训练。

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记和阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更好地处理AI代理在现实环境中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IMO 2025等数学竞赛中，LLM需要生成每个步骤都正确且有充分支持的证明，因此需要强大的步骤级验证器来训练LLM推理系统。

Method: 构建Hard2Verify基准，包含500多小时人工标注，评估29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型在步骤级验证任务上的表现。

Result: 除了少数优秀模型外，开源验证器在步骤级验证任务上落后于闭源模型，研究分析了性能差的原因、计算规模的影响以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Conclusion: Hard2Verify基准揭示了步骤级验证的挑战性，开源验证器需要改进，研究为理解验证器性能驱动因素和验证-生成关系提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
