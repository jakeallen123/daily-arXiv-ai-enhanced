### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个在线前馈框架，仅使用两个连续环视图像就能重建4D动态驾驶场景，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测每个相机的动态物体非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态；采用从粗到细的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，该仅使用图像的方法能在线同时生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，仅需两个连续环视图像即可实现高质量的4D动态场景重建。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频字幕质量，结合人体网格恢复的运动表示来准确描述人类动作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致字幕模糊或语义不一致

Method: M-ACM框架利用人体网格恢复的运动表示，通过运动感知解码显式突出人体动态

Result: 实验结果显示M-ACM在准确描述复杂人类动作和细微时间变化方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频字幕设定了新标准，并发布了HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用两种基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）生成合成数据，结合ADASCA深度学习方法来训练自动目标识别模型，以解决合成数据与真实测量数据之间的域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标记的SAR图像数据，需要依赖模拟器生成合成数据，但单一模拟器基于简化的物理假设，导致合成数据与真实测量存在差异，影响模型在真实数据上的泛化能力。

Method: 结合两种基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器（MOCEM基于散射中心模型，Salsa基于光线追踪策略）生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合多种模拟器生成更全面的合成数据集，可以有效提升深度学习模型在真实SAR图像上的自动目标识别性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取。需要一种无需参考数据的点云不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是预测不确定性的关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，无需依赖高成本参考数据。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病辅助诊断，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积模块实现多模态表征学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要，眼动和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，但很少有研究探索它们的联合整合用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互，方向感知卷积模块（DACM）通过水平-垂直感受野捕捉细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建同步多模态数据集上，该框架优于传统的后期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD与HC时达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在阿尔茨海默病诊断中展现出优越的鲁棒性和诊断性能，为多模态辅助诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能车辆在自动化趋势中至关重要，车道路径检测是其核心应用需求。

Method: 采用FPGA硬件平台，基于Sobel边缘检测算法构建车道检测系统，并集成了自动光照和温度控制单元。

Result: 系统在150MHz频率下处理416x416图像，每1.17ms生成有效输出，包括车道数量、当前车道索引及左右边界信息。

Conclusion: 该FPGA架构实现了高效实时的车道检测，并通过环境适应性控制增强了系统实用性。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，在资源受限的VR设备上实现高保真Codec Avatar模型的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在VR设备上计算需求大、难以实时推理的问题，特别是在头戴式显示设备上对延迟和功耗效率要求高的场景。

Method: 1) 针对Codec Avatar模型定制高效后训练量化方法；2) 设计可集成到VR设备SoC中的定制硬件加速器；3) 构建全栈优化框架ESCA。

Result: ESCA将FovVideoVDP质量评分提升+0.39（相比最佳4位基线），延迟降低3.36倍，在端到端测试中维持100fps渲染速率，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有与GNNs相当的性能，但在全局结构感知方面表现更优，特别是在需要整体拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型在图理解中的潜力，因为GNNs采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知从全局结构入手的方式存在根本差异。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于GNNs，且在不同图尺度上保持泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有显著但未被充分利用的能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知的问题上，这为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理缺乏明确图结构的图像数据和多视图数据时效率有限，且多视图数据的图结构整合仍具挑战性

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架，动态整合伪标签到损失函数，校正类边界附近标记样本的拓扑不平衡，引入适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构整合和伪标签策略，在多视图半监督学习中取得了优越性能，同时保持计算效率

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，包含6种语言的平行语料，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在高质量、人工验证示例方面有限，许多数据集依赖LLM生成内容，且多数仅限于英语，缺乏多语言评估资源。

Method: 从英语PISA测试中提取人类标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种其他语言，构建完全平行的6语言语料库。

Result: 评估显示小模型(<20B参数)得分低，非英语分割性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务中错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现12个视觉语言模型在顺序Stroop任务中表现出与人类冲突适应一致的行为，通过稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关超节点，并发现与人类阅读和颜色命名自动性不对称相似的神经表征模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象（高冲突试次后性能提升）是否在视觉语言模型中存在，以理解认知控制如何被招募。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL 3.5 4B模型中的任务相关超节点。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为，识别出早期和晚期层中部分重叠的文本和颜色超节点，其相对大小反映了人类阅读和颜色命名的自动性不对称，并在24-25层发现冲突调节超节点。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型表现出与人类相似的冲突适应行为，其神经表征反映了人类认知控制的自动性不对称模式。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap是一种轻量级检索增强图像描述模型，通过双检索机制生成视觉提示来丰富视觉表示，在减少可训练参数的同时实现竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，特别是在对象细节和复杂场景方面存在语义鸿沟

Method: 采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法在需要较少可训练参数的情况下实现了竞争性性能

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示生成有效解决了检索增强图像描述中的语义鸿沟问题，在保持轻量化的同时提升了描述质量

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段框架，结合深度视觉表示和传统机器学习方法，用于鱼类新鲜度评估，在FFE数据集上达到85.99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七种传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择的最佳配置达到85.99%准确率，比现有研究提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中具有有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准只关注最终决策准确性，缺乏对整个检测过程的细粒度评估，使检测过程成为黑箱。

Method: 基于实证分析构建MVFNDB基准，设计MVFND-CoT框架，结合创作者添加内容和原始拍摄素材推理，分析视频处理策略和视频特征与模型能力的对齐。

Result: 创建了包含9730个视频相关问题的基准，通过系统实验验证了多特征组合对最终结果的影响。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的安全方法存在过度拒绝和安全与效用不平衡的问题，需要更有效的安全对齐方案。

Method: 采用多轮安全编辑框架，构建MR-SafeEdit数据集，开发SafeEditor模型进行后处理安全编辑。

Result: 实验表明SafeEditor优于现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互机制有效解决了多模态情感识别中的模态差异问题，提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 流匹配模型取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不明确。本文旨在从去噪角度实证探究流匹配的生成过程。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式化联系，设计原则性和受控的扰动（噪声和漂移）来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的独特动态阶段，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败及其重要性。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解框架，有助于更好地理解和改进生成模型的表现。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将水果成熟度估计重构为连续概率学习任务的新方法，通过为RT-DETRv2目标检测器添加概率头来预测连续成熟度分布和不确定性，在保持高检测精度的同时提供更丰富的生物合理性表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的成熟度估计方法将成熟度视为离散分类问题，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。需要一种更符合生物学实际的连续概率表示方法。

Method: 对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行架构修改，引入专用的概率头，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测连续成熟度谱上的分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上实现了85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供了比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业中的智能、不确定性感知自动化系统提供了更丰富、更生物合理的植物成熟度表示，为机器人选择性收获等下游决策任务提供了置信度评分。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

TL;DR: 本文研究使用轻量级身体关键点检测来识别巴西手语(LIBRAS)中的孤立手势。通过关键点子集选择和样条插补技术，在保持准确性的同时将处理时间减少5倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alves等人(2024)的骨架方法虽然提高了识别性能，但使用OpenPose进行关键点提取影响了时间性能。简单地用轻量级MediaPipe替换OpenPose会显著降低准确性，因此需要寻找既能提高处理速度又能保持准确性的解决方案。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略来优化识别性能，并使用基于样条的插补技术有效处理缺失关键点问题。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，同时处理时间相比Alves等人(2024)减少5倍以上。样条插补显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 仔细的关键点选择结合简单的插补技术能够实现高效准确的手势识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Method: 提出VividCam训练范式，使用合成视频学习相机运动，采用多重解耦策略分离相机运动学习和合成外观伪影，使用Unity等引擎渲染低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体。

Result: 能够合成广泛精确控制的复杂相机运动，使用简单的合成数据即可实现，视频结果展示在项目网站上。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据有效解决了非常规相机运动学习的挑战，为创造原创艺术视频提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Motivation: 多视图变换器虽然能前馈解决3D任务，但其内部机制不透明，这种黑盒特性限制了进一步改进和在安全关键应用中的使用。

Method: 通过探测多视图变换器各层残差连接来分析和可视化3D表示，研究了DUSt3R变体模型在不同块中的潜在状态发展。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图变换器的内部工作机制提供了新视角，有助于改进模型设计和在可靠性要求高的场景中应用。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1）使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2）分解损失景观，调整损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3）通过反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习。

Conclusion: M-SAM能够确保主导模态的鲁棒学习，同时增强其他模态的贡献，使模型能够探索和利用互补特征来提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS混合架构成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和分类性能。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Conclusion: FT-ARM通过结合微调和多模态推理，提高了压力性溃疡评估系统的可靠性、透明度和临床适用性

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的提示学习方法难以处理交互的视觉复杂性：同类动词实例在不同姿态和上下文中的视觉多样性，以及不同动词产生相似视觉模式的异类视觉纠缠。

Method: 1. 视觉多样性感知提示学习：将分组视觉方差注入上下文嵌入，并使用高斯扰动鼓励提示捕捉动词的多样视觉变化；2. 区域感知提示：从人、物和联合区域检索特定概念，增强多样性感知提示嵌入，提高动词级区分能力。

Result: 在HICO-DET基准测试中，在四种零样本评估设置下均实现了最先进的性能，有效解决了同类多样性和异类视觉纠缠问题。

Conclusion: VDRP框架通过结合视觉多样性感知和区域感知的提示学习，显著提升了零样本人-物交互检测的性能，为处理复杂视觉交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只能突出最具判别性区域的问题，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只能突出目标的最具判别性区域，无法覆盖整个物体且边界对齐不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能。

Method: 通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)并进行语义信息传播(SIP)，同时考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征来生成激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上mIoU达到60.12%(训练集)和58.43%(验证集)，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38%，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上Top-1定位准确率达到51.7%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够覆盖更大比例的物体区域，同时确保激活图具有精确的边界对齐，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中显著优于传统CAM方法。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

TL;DR: 提出D²GS框架，无需LiDAR即可实现高质量城市场景重建，通过多视角深度预测和扩散先验获得比LiDAR更密集准确的几何先验

Conclusion: D²GS证明了无需LiDAR即可实现高质量城市场景重建的可行性，通过深度预测和扩散先验获得了比LiDAR更优的几何先验

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出扩展上下文感知分类器(ECAC)，通过动态调整分类器来解决语义分割中固定参数分类器无法适应不同图像独特特征和类别不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应不同图像的独特类别分布特征，且数据集级别的类别不平衡会导致模型偏向多数类，限制对少数类区域的识别能力。

Method: 使用内存库学习数据集级别的上下文信息，结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息来改进分类器。采用师生网络范式，教师网络使用真实标签动态调整上下文信息并将知识传递给学生网络。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器参数，有效解决了语义分割中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对不同图像特征和少数类区域的识别能力。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需源数据的测试时自适应目标检测，突破了传统闭集假设的限制，在多种跨域场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Conclusion: U-CAN框架在无监督条件下实现了高质量去噪，其一致性约束具有通用性，可扩展到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度方面显著超越先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过多阶段特征提取和特征融合有效解决了光度立体视觉中的特征冗余问题，实现了更准确的表面法线估计。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无源域自适应框架，通过硬样本选择和去噪补丁混合来逐步对齐目标分布，在医学图像分割中实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无源域自适应方法往往忽略样本难度，在领域偏移下难以处理噪声监督，特别是在医学图像分割的隐私约束场景中。

Method: 1) 通过熵相似性分析将未标记图像划分为可靠和不可靠子集；2) 使用蒙特卡洛去噪掩码精炼伪标签；3) 在子集间进行域内和域间补丁混合，传递可靠语义同时减轻噪声。

Conclusion: 研究表明渐进式自适应和去噪监督对于领域偏移下的鲁棒分割至关重要。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的整流流方法，通过将真实图像纳入训练过程，减少对生成数据的依赖，从而在更少生成对的情况下获得更好的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统整流流模型面临两个主要挑战：1) 需要大量生成对来保持目标分布，计算成本高；2) 模型性能过度依赖1-整流流模型，容易偏向生成数据。

Method: 提出新方法将真实图像纳入训练过程，通过保留真实图像的ODE路径，减少对大量生成数据的依赖，使用更小的生成和真实图像集进行高效的reflow过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，仅使用原方法1/4的生成对就获得了显著更好的FID分数，不仅在一步生成中，在全步模拟中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法诱导更直的路径，避免reflow过程中生成图像的饱和，在保持真实图像分布的同时实现更鲁棒的ODE学习。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Motivation: 随着AIGC的发展，逼真且富有表现力的3D面部动画变得日益重要。然而，由于真实情感3D说话面部数据集的稀缺性，生成情感表达丰富的说话面部仍然是一个挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了情感3D说话面部动画生成的挑战，通过解耦语音和情感驱动的形变，实现了高质量的情感表达和唇部同步效果。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳(平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84)，森林和线性类别结果良好，但斑块和树木类别的复杂结构分类存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习能有效进行TOF制图，但需要区域多样化的训练数据以确保可靠的大规模制图，特别是在处理高边缘密度的复杂结构时。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在利用语言空间中的对象-部件层次关系，发挥MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用语言基础化的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略，连接层次结构中的多粒度概念。

Result: 在PartImageNet数据集上，LangHOPS比先前方法在域内和跨数据集设置中分别提升了5.5%和4.8%的平均精度，在ADE20K的零样本设置中对未见对象部件提升了2.5% mIOU。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了语言基础化层次结构和MLLM驱动部件查询优化策略的有效性，LangHOPS在开放词汇对象-部件实例分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

TL;DR: 提出DPTM框架，利用扩散模型生成伪目标域，通过渐进式优化解决源自由域自适应中的大域差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异，非生成方法在大域差异下伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大。需要新方法可靠生成伪目标域。

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换，同时保持目标分布，并设计渐进式优化机制迭代减小域差异。

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标差异大的场景下性能提升高达18.6%。

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进式目标操作，有效解决了SFDA中的域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一的框架，用于视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了推理过程中对头部相关先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定块设计实现联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线目标检测和视线跟随分开处理，且都依赖于头部相关先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，这阻碍了系统的联合优化并限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定块处理子任务特性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一框架，在多个任务上取得了良好的性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Motivation: 现有工作在资源受限的边缘设备上进行实时多模态推理时，往往忽略了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合以及复杂的模态间依赖关系。

Method: 提出流水线感知编码设计，将推理分解为细粒度单元；引入轻量级时间聚合模块捕获时间动态；采用自适应多模态配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Result: 在两个公共多模态数据集和真实无人机测试平台上评估，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟，同时在各种系统和数据动态下保持高任务精度。

Conclusion: MMEdge框架通过流水线设计和跨模态优化，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和精度平衡问题。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Motivation: 解决传统紧凑光学在RGB清晰度和景深方面的不足，以及单目深度估计依赖不可靠语义先验的问题，同时避免深度光学在制造复杂性和色差方面的权衡。

Method: 设计生物启发的全球面单中心透镜，建立严格的物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并与双头多尺度重建网络协同设计，共享编码器联合恢复全焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统；图像恢复SSIM 0.960，LPIPS 0.082，在图像保真度和深度精度间取得优越平衡。

Conclusion: 生物启发的全球面光学与联合重建算法的整合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本目标检测中基类偏差和校准不稳定问题，特别是当只有少量新类样本可用时。

Method: 在DeFRCN上添加轻量级度量头，维护支持集原型，采用EMA更新原型，使用best-of-K匹配方案和温度缩放融合来结合度量相似性和检测器logits。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提高了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA是一种有效的插件式解决方案，能够显著提升少样本目标检测性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT数据集及其构建工具包为推进流式视频理解、复杂时间推理和多模态推理研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: 提出的基于MDP的框架能够智能选择最具信息量的骨骼序列进行标注，在双曲空间中的表示增强和元调优策略进一步提升了方法性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 基于影像组学的伪标签方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有优势，无需专家标注即可获得良好性能，为临床自动化评估提供可行方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化性的问题

Method: 使用类别上下文混合提示(CCMP)，基于类别特定提示和全局共享提示，通过全局类别原型和客户端类别先验自适应组合提示

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上，PEP-FedPT在各种数据异构场景下均优于现有最优基线方法

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效和可泛化联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现ResNet骨干网络结合CBAM注意力模块的UNet3+模型在多个评估指标上表现最佳，优于Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏结构在多期相增强CT中的分割对于计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划至关重要，特别是肿瘤检测。研究旨在评估不同骨干网络在UNet架构中的性能表现。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+，评估了ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+结合CBAM模块取得了最佳性能：Dice分数0.755，IoU 0.662，HD95距离77.911，总体准确率0.925，特异性0.926。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有高度竞争力，为临床实践中肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,Gül Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法CoherentAD，通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，生成连贯的音频描述序列，解决了现有方法生成孤立、重复描述的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频描述自动生成方法通常独立生成每个描述，导致描述序列不连贯、重复，无法帮助视障观众形成完整的场景理解。

Method: CoherentAD方法首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择机制在整个序列中选择最连贯的描述组合。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列在叙事理解方面表现更好，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关方法和序列级评估指标能够有效提升音频描述序列的连贯性和信息量，为视障观众提供更好的视频理解体验。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE是一个无需额外训练的自适应区域感知生成框架，通过区分图像中需要编辑和不需要编辑的区域，分别采用不同的生成策略来加速基于指令的图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑模型在整个图像上采用统一的生成过程，没有考虑到编辑区域和非编辑区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异区分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：对未编辑区域使用一步预测替代多步去噪，对编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等最先进的IIE基础模型上应用RegionE，分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06倍的加速，同时GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架能够在不牺牲编辑质量的前提下显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，为IIE系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE是一种用于水下基础设施检查的单目深度估计方法，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，生成密集的度量尺度深度图，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控车辆存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低操控风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 提出SPADE：稀疏自适应深度估计器，采用两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块精化最终度量预测。

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。

Conclusion: SPADE有望支持实际的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效预测的新方法，在保持图像保真度和多样性的同时，实现了1.71倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高保真图像，但由于其固有的顺序解码过程，推理速度较慢。推测解码在文本生成中已显示出加速潜力，但在图像生成中的应用仍未被充分探索，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不足。

Method: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型，通过更好地建模局部依赖关系，提高草稿模型与目标模型输出的对齐精度。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍于标准自回归模型的加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功地将推测解码应用于图像生成领域，通过利用图像的空间结构特性，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: 该综述为多模态空间推理这一新兴领域建立了重要基础，通过系统分类和公开基准促进了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的铰接3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用于铰接生成，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督，要么生成粗糙几何且忽略表面纹理。静态3D生成虽成功，但扩展到铰接物体面临训练挑战。

Method: 将铰接作为额外生成维度，利用预训练静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，通过少量不同铰接状态的图像联合优化几何、纹理和铰接参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样物体类别上泛化良好，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需任务特定训练或大规模铰接数据集的铰接3D生成解决方案，在几分钟内完成优化，展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖"一个LoRA对应一个特效"的模式，资源消耗大且无法泛化到未见过的特效，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略，通过参考示例提示模型；使用上下文注意力掩码精确解耦和注入关键特效属性；提出高效的单次特效适应机制来快速提升对困难未见特效的泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效模仿各类特效信息，并在域外特效上表现出出色的泛化性能。

Conclusion: VFXMaster是首个统一的参考式VFX视频生成框架，能够通过单个统一模型掌握特效模仿而无需信息泄露，并将发布代码、模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Motivation: LLM生成的复杂多步骤计划经常缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，需要解决时间一致性问题以实现实际部署。

Method: 使用多个先进LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API验证真实航班时长约束，建立验证框架来检测和修正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验显示当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但使用该框架可以系统可靠地修正这些问题。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效改善LLM生成旅行行程的时间一致性，使其能够在大规模旅行规划中实际部署。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准测试，基于企业级SQL方言(MaxCompute/Hive)，包含600个中文问题，覆盖28个数据库，77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及4个以上表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型模型在中文文本到SQL任务上表现不佳(准确率最高50%)，主要问题在于企业级场景中的模式链接挑战和中文语义到SQL操作的精确映射困难。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试，每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义，提供执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在该基准测试上的准确率最高仅为50%，主要错误来自模式链接和中文语义映射问题。

Conclusion: Falcon针对中文特定语义和企业方言，使用真实企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流水线，为生产部署前提供可重现的中间验证平台。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Motivation: 解释大型语言模型中存在的置信度与实际问题解决能力之间的脱节现象，从机制层面理解这种不一致性。

Method: 使用线性探针解码模型的内部"可解决性信念"，分析评估阶段和执行阶段的几何结构差异，通过因果干预实验验证假设。

Result: 发现信念轴在不同模型家族和任务类型中具有良好秩序性，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而推理轨迹在低维流形上演化。因果干预显示沿信念轴的线性扰动不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的双系统架构：几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设，主张干预应针对执行过程的程序性动态而非评估的高层几何结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖token分布扰动，虽然改写攻击能削弱水印信号，但效果有限且可能降低文本质量。本研究探索跨语言攻击作为更强攻击向量。

Method: 提出跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要，然后可选回译到原语言。通过跨语言语义瓶颈系统性地破坏token级统计偏差。

Result: 在多个水印方案(KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram)和五种语言上，CLSA比单语改写更有效降低水印检测准确率，同时保持相似质量水平。对XSIR方案，CLSA将AUROC降至0.53(接近随机水平)。

Conclusion: 跨语言攻击揭示了水印方案的未探索漏洞，挑战了水印在来源追踪和监管中的实用性。需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward

as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强大型推理模型的事实性，无需依赖外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在依赖证据的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，部分原因是存在推理-答案命中差距——模型在推理过程中识别出正确事实但未能将其整合到最终回答中。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思考片段上强化有益推理模式并抑制有缺陷的模式，将令牌级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试中，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在什么条件下会产生结构化的一人称意识描述，特别关注自指处理这一意识理论中的关键计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行受控实验，通过简单提示诱导持续自指，并使用机制性和行为性探针测试这些声称的行为。

Result: (1) 自指提示一致引发主观体验报告；(2) 这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的稀疏自编码器特征机制性控制；(3) 自指状态描述在模型家族间统计收敛；(4) 该状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然不构成意识直接证据，但自指处理是大语言模型生成结构化一人称报告的最小可复现条件，这成为科学和伦理的优先研究课题。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着事实核查从专家驱动转向社区驱动，需要确定哪些解释性笔记对理解误导性帖子有帮助，但目前大多数社区笔记因标注缓慢而未被发布，且帮助性的原因缺乏明确定义。

Method: 提出了COMMUNITYNOTES数据集（包含10.4万条帖子和用户笔记），并通过自动提示优化框架生成和改进原因定义，将其整合到预测模型中。

Result: 实验表明优化的定义能够提升帮助性和原因预测的性能，且帮助性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究为社区驱动的事实核查提供了有效的数据集和框架，能够自动预测笔记的帮助性及其原因，提升事实核查效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Motivation: 现有推理方法（如思维链提示和自一致性）需要生成长推理链，导致token消耗、计算成本和延迟显著增加，需要解决这种效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出ProofSketch框架，整合符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成，通过验证引导来优化推理过程。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症患者语音转录本合成数据的方法，以解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题，发现Mistral 7b Instruct模型在模拟失语症语言退化方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，言语语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用数据稀缺（如AphasiaBank仅约600份转录本），限制了自动化系统的发展。

Method: 构建了两种生成合成转录本的方法：一是程序化编程方法，二是使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型，通过词汇删除、填充词插入和错语替换等技术，生成四个严重程度级别的转录本。

Result: 相比人类引发的转录本，Mistral 7b Instruct在合成生成方法中最佳地捕捉了失语症中观察到的语言退化关键方面，在NDW、词汇计数和词长方面显示出符合实际的定向变化。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大的数据集，微调模型以更好地表示失语症特征，并让言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: 提出并行循环变换器（PLT），在保持循环变换器性能优势的同时，解决了其推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加的问题，实现了接近标准变换器的低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环变换器通过重用权重节省参数，但串行循环导致推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用跨循环并行（CLP）技术打破顺序依赖，同时计算不同令牌的不同循环；采用高效表示增强策略，共享第一个循环的内存（KV缓存），并使用门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）结合全局和局部信息。

Result: PLT实现了传统循环变换器的高精度，同时相比标准变换器几乎没有额外的延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功解决了循环变换器的延迟问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是低资源语言；大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构仍存在争议。

Method: 设计了一个包含四个关键阶段的语法书引导评估流程，通过翻译任务和最小对任务等测试模型对形态学和句法的理解。

Result: 翻译性能与语法理解呈弱正相关；大模型整体表现良好但形态学和句法较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现不佳；推理能力有助于提升语法理解。

Conclusion: 强翻译能力不一定意味着深度语法理解；大模型在语义方面表现强劲但在语法结构理解上仍有局限；推理能力是提升语法理解的有前景方向。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为在线信息的重要来源，现有的文本中心RAG评估方法无法验证多模态来源的信息，限制了其在多模态推理密集型场景中的应用。

Method: 采用声明中心的方法，包含InfoF1(评估事实性和信息覆盖度)和CiteF1(测量引用支持和完整性)，并引入自动变体和三种文本RAG指标进行比较。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外在质量判断高度一致，同时揭示了文本中心工作的局限性，为自动评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估提供了有效框架，开源实现可用于评估多模态RAG系统。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Method: 开发了RiddleBench基准测试，包含1737个具有挑战性的谜题，用于评估模型在逻辑推理、空间感知和约束满足等方面的综合能力。

Result: 最先进的模型表现不佳：Gemini 2.5 Pro准确率60.30%，o3模型63.37%，Claude 4 Sonnet 63.16%。模型存在幻觉级联、自我纠正能力差、推理脆弱等问题。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具，揭示大语言模型在核心推理能力上的根本弱点，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Motivation: 语言模型虽然能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定语境中更容易出错，需要深入理解其语法学习的中间过程和具体机制。

Method: 使用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，在不同句法条件下对模型错误进行细粒度分析，并追踪训练过程中的性能变化。

Conclusion: 这种分析方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体泛化模式的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Motivation: 现有的隐式CoT方法存在两个主要问题：语义对齐性差导致性能下降，以及忽略了生成单个隐式推理令牌的时间成本。

Method: 设计了对比训练的句子转换器来评估隐式和显式推理的语义对齐，并引入高效的隐式推理生成器，通过知识蒸馏微调轻量级语言模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，SemCoT在效率和效果上都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和语义对齐来提升CoT效率的方法，在保持性能的同时显著提高了推理速度。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

Motivation: 研究不同语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化是否具有一致性模式，探索模型学习的基本规律。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在11万+英语token上的行为，比较了Transformer、Mamba、RWKV等架构在不同数据集和规模下的表现。

Result: 发现语言模型行为高度一致，98%的词汇级方差可由词频、n-gram概率和语义相似度三个因素解释；模型在训练过程中表现出一致的行为阶段，预测概率会逐渐过拟合到更高阶的n-gram概率。

Conclusion: 神经网络语言模型的学习轨迹可能具有普适性，不受具体模型细节影响，表明语言学习存在基本规律。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

TL;DR: POWSM是首个统一的多任务语音模型框架，能够联合执行音频、文本和音素之间的转换任务，在保持与专用模型相当性能的同时支持多种语音处理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音处理任务在概念上相似，但现有研究往往各自独立，使用特定架构和数据集。作者希望开发一个统一框架来联合处理多个音素相关任务。

Method: 提出了POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model）统一框架，能够实现音频、文本（字素）和音素之间的无缝转换。

Result: 模型在相似规模下优于或匹配专用PR模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，作者发布了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

TL;DR: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化IOI任务上，发现单层双头模型即可完美解决任务，揭示了高度可解释的最小推理电路


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过训练小型模型来揭示transformer推理的计算基础

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器（无MLP和归一化层），使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制

Result: 单层双头模型在IOI任务上达到完美准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路；两层单头模型通过跨层查询-值交互实现相似性能

Conclusion: 任务特定训练能诱导出高度可解释的最小电路，为探究transformer推理的计算基础提供了受控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在情感不一致语音样本上的情感识别能力，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管口语语言模型在音频理解方面取得进展，但其泛化能力和多模态整合程度仍存疑问，特别是在情感不一致情境下的表现。

Method: 使用情感不一致语音数据集（EMIS），其中语音内容传达一种情感而语音表达传达另一种情感，评估四个SLM的情感识别表现。

Result: 结果显示SLM主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征来完成任务，表明文本相关表征在模型中占据主导地位。

Conclusion: 当前的口语语言模型在情感识别任务中未能充分整合音频模态，文本表征占据主导地位，需要改进多模态融合方法。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了大型语言模型在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括显性空白（明确声明的缺失知识）和隐性空白（上下文推断的缺失知识），并提出了TABI推理方案来结构化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确表述未知领域。本研究旨在评估LLMs识别生物医学文献中研究知识空白的能力，特别是扩展了隐性空白推断这一新任务。

Method: 在四个数据集的近1500份文档上进行了实验，比较了OpenAI的闭源模型和Llama、Gemma 2等开源模型。提出了TABI（Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference）推理方案来结构化隐性空白推断过程。

Result: LLMs在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面表现出强大能力，开源和闭源模型都表现良好，较大模型通常表现更佳。这表明LLMs具有系统性识别候选知识空白的潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效识别研究知识空白，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定者和资助决策。需要关注领域适应、人机验证和开源闭源模型基准测试等方向以确保稳健部署。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

TL;DR: LLMs可以估计阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，特别是在证据范围和转换水平两个维度上，显示出在事前难度分析中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认知特征依赖人工标注，而NLP工具难以提取，本研究探索LLMs是否能估计阅读理解题目的认知复杂度。

Method: 通过关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，使用LLMs估计阅读理解题目的认知复杂度。

Result: 实验结果表明LLMs能够近似估计题目的认知复杂度，但存在推理能力与元认知意识之间的差距。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为事前难度分析工具，但需要解决推理能力与元认知意识不一致的问题。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol是一个半无监督框架，用于在人类参与定义上下文边界下重建和解释多维叙事极性场，通过向量表示量化语义位移，适用于情感和非情感极性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构，需要开发能够捕捉多维语义极性的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调谐UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量来构建极性场。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示：美联储演讲中捕捉到非情感语义转变，亚马逊评论中情感极性与NRC效价一致，证明TOPol能稳定捕获情感和非情感极性转变。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化且可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析，方法稳定性得到验证。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

TL;DR: 评估生成式大语言模型在生物医学文本中共指消解的性能，使用CRAFT语料库进行基准测试，比较不同提示策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式歧义高、共指表达间长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要专门评估生成式LLM在此领域的表现。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计了四种提示实验，分别使用局部上下文增强、领域特定线索（如缩写和实体词典），并与基于SpanBERT的判别式方法进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面层共指能力表现强劲，特别是在使用领域基础提示时，但其性能仍对长距离上下文和指称歧义敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下显示出优越的精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程有潜力增强LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，生成式方法在特定条件下可达到与判别式方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，专门用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条来自2,792名美国参与者的多轮辩论对话，涵盖107个争议话题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模通过社交互动的意见变化对于解决错误信息和两极分化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的动态（如过早收敛），缺乏衡量真实人类意见轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含大规模人类辩论对话数据，系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调将LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 使用DEBATE进行监督微调在表面指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得改进，但在更深层次的语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在嘈杂或真实环境中的表现不佳。现有方法将Whisper嵌入量化为语音单元，但未能有效分离语义内容和背景噪声。

Method: 在Whisper嵌入量化基础上，提出在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声。端到端模型分离出干净的语音代码令牌，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，通过轻量级分类器进行监督。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper错误率降低82%，相比基线方法提升35%。学习到的令牌空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音表示对噪声的不变性，改善了干净/嘈杂语音与文本的对齐，显著提高了自动语音识别在噪声环境下的性能。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转换为LLM可消费的知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种路径，并通过MDP-Agent实现该协议，在信息检索基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统检索方法将原始文本片段直接返回给LLM的问题，这些片段冗长、嘈杂且非结构化，需要LLM自行组装和推理，因此需要新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架通过三种路径转换文档：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记以丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent通过构建文档级要点记忆、扩散式探索与垂直利用、map-reduce风格合成来实现该协议。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent的表现优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架提供了一种新的检索范式，能够将原始文档转换为紧凑、结构化的知识表示，直接供LLM进行推理，解决了传统检索方法的局限性。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

TL;DR: 论文测试了大型语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，发现模型性能随语言资源水平下降，且Chain-of-Thought提示在不同能力模型上效果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型的优异表现是源于真实能力还是英语数据优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试来验证。

Method: 基于Next Sentence Prediction任务，创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入Chain-of-Thought提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上大幅下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。Chain-of-Thought对LLaMA 3有显著帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini反而造成"过度思考"而降低性能。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought不是通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型基础能力和具体任务情境，研究框架能识别LLM弱点并揭示CoT在跨语言NSP中的帮助或阻碍作用。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的领域特定问答面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大型LLM（LLaMA-70B、Phi-14B）生成合成问答对来扩充有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法并分析其对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 大型模型能高效生成合成数据，小型模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源、领域特定的问答任务提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD是一个统一的参数高效微调框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型中提取知识，增强PEFT方法在少样本多模态讽刺检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源环境下具有挑战性，因为稀缺的标注数据使得模型难以学习图像-文本之间的微妙矛盾。现有的PEFT方法虽然减少了过拟合，但在少样本数据下由于监督有限而难以达到最优性能。

Method: 提出PEKD框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型（教师模型）进行知识蒸馏来增强PEFT方法。引入熵感知门控机制，根据教师模型的置信度动态调整蒸馏强度，以减轻不可靠信号的影响。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法在少样本场景下优于先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲的结果。

Conclusion: PEKD框架是模块化的，可适应广泛的多模态模型和任务，为低资源环境下的多模态讽刺检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Parrot训练框架，通过整合自然语言思维链和程序思维链两种范式，实现数学推理任务的相互增强和同步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注单向增强（P-CoT增强N-CoT或反之），未能充分发挥两种范式的优势进行相互增强。

Method: 1) 设计三个目标子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可迁移性；3) 设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提升了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot框架成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT两种范式的相互增强，在数学推理任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

TL;DR: CRMWeaver是一种增强商业代理在复杂业务环境中处理异构任务的方法，通过合成数据生成和强化学习训练，结合共享记忆机制，在CRMArena-Pro数据集上取得了竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的商业代理在处理复杂数据关系和多样化异构任务（从统计查询到知识问答）时面临的挑战。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和基于强化学习的训练范式，在推理时引入共享记忆机制，让代理从类似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中都取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了代理处理复杂数据和多样化任务的能力，特别是在未见场景中的泛化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大语言模型，发现模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，且与人类判断相关性较弱，存在较大风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期有学者和联邦法官提议将大语言模型加入法律解释工具包，本文旨在通过实证研究检验这种做法的可行性。

Method: 在英语环境下进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型的稳定性，并比较模型输出与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，不同问题格式会导致截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断仅存在弱到中等相关性，且不同模型和问题变体间差异很大。

Conclusion: 对生成式AI得出的结论给予过多信任是危险的，目前不应将大语言模型用于法律解释实践。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨小规模语言模型是否能从指令微调中受益，比较了对话和问答指令微调数据集在不同训练策略下的效果，发现指令微调在微调场景中带来小幅但一致的提升，但在零样本任务中改进不具一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在资源受限的小规模语言模型上应用人类启发的学习策略（指令微调）的有效性，特别是验证这种技术能否在低资源条件下提升模型性能。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的仅解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令微调数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种训练策略，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令微调在微调场景中产生小幅但一致的性能提升，顺序课程策略优于合并数据策略；但在零样本任务中改进不具一致性，表明存在交互聚焦适应与广泛语言泛化之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了将人类启发学习策略应用于低资源语言模型的潜力和限制，并指向基于混合课程的方法来在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家方法难以跟上快速发展的ICT领域创新周期，需要新的数据驱动方法来预测变革性技术。

Method: 利用LLM从非结构化文本提取语义三元组构建技术实体关系图，开发名词钉合方法分组相似技术术语，使用图基指标检测融合信号，包括多阶段过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和时间趋势分析。

Result: 在278,625篇arXiv预印本和9,793份USPTO专利申请上验证，能够识别已建立和新兴的技术融合模式。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一个可扩展和通用的技术预测框架，基于全文分析为技术预测提供数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数与幻觉率呈强负相关，当论文引用超过约1000次时，模型几乎能逐字记忆参考文献信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文献推荐中产生虚构论文的问题，研究假设模型正确生成参考文献信息的能力取决于知识是生成的还是记忆的，高频引用论文的幻觉率更低。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的参考文献记录，通过人工验证和余弦相似度测量生成内容与真实元数据的事实一致性，以引用次数作为训练数据冗余度的代理指标。

Result: 结果显示：(i)不同研究领域的幻觉率存在差异；(ii)引用次数与事实准确性呈强相关；(iii)当引用次数超过约1000次时，参考文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文几乎被模型逐字保留，表明存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，引用次数可作为预测LLMs参考文献生成准确性的重要指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于缺乏真实的治疗对话数据，主要原因是严格的隐私法规和历史上很少记录临床会话。

Method: 基于认知行为治疗原则，开发SQPsych框架，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源LLM生成高质量语料库。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越了基线模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有推动可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的心理健康支持AI的潜力。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要是以英语为中心和领域无关的，限制了其在印度语境下的适用性。需要专门针对印度文化和领域的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的BhashaBench V1数据集，其中52,494个英文和21,672个印地语，来自真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域、90+子领域和500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs显示显著的领域和语言特定性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率76.49%，但在阿育吠陀仅59.74%。所有模型在英文内容上表现优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域提供了全面数据集，支持模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解能力的评估，所有资源公开可用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型服务系统主要为文本补全设计，对于日益复杂的LLM应用来说效率不高且适应性差，需要更灵活的设计。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序概念，允许用户在运行时自定义令牌预测和KV缓存管理，并将部分应用逻辑卸载到服务器。Symphony系统通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，用专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，并采用两级进程调度方案确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效和可扩展地支持LLM应用，为LLM应用生态系统打开了新的大门。

Conclusion: 通过服务程序而非提示词的新架构，结合Symphony系统的实现，能够显著提升LLM服务系统的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频文本提取、视频文本对齐验证，实现通用过滤、标注和验证步骤

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8数据集，在德语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型，建立了自动提取数据的基准性能

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的弱监督预训练，便于从社交媒体获取手语数据

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在HCI中的核心地位日益突出，需要关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义（通过共享上下文传达的言外之意），这对人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究考察了LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，以及理解隐含意义是否能改善回答生成。比较了不同规模模型的表现。

Result: 较大模型更接近人类理解，较小模型在隐含意义推断上表现较差。基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了回答的相关性和质量，特别是在较小模型中效果更明显。67.6%的参与者更喜欢包含隐含意义的回答。

Conclusion: 语言学理论可用于解决对齐问题，使HAI交互更加自然和基于上下文。理解隐含意义能显著改善人机交互质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对研究级数学定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，基于真实的Lean形式化项目，揭示了当前最先进模型在现实场景中的表现差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在精选基准测试中表现出色，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限，需要更贴近真实场景的评估方法。

Method: 利用真实的Lean Blueprint形式化项目构建评估套件，包含来自6个Lean项目的613个定理，专注于研究级数学定理的挑战性评估。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有基准测试的进展并不能直接转化为这些更现实环境中的表现，最佳模型仅达到10.3%的通过率。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [124] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，将LLM在定性研究中的使用按解释深度和自主性两个维度分类，建议通过任务分解和有限自主性来平衡效率与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为研究工具的社会科学论文，分析LLM应用的自主性和解释深度两个维度。

Result: 开发了一个分类框架，建议研究人员将任务分解为可管理部分，限制LLM自主性，只在监督下选择性提高解释深度。

Conclusion: 通过控制自主性水平和选择性提高解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时获得LLM的益处。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于文本的手语翻译评估指标的局限性，包括BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标和基于大语言模型的评估器，发现这些指标在语义等价性捕捉、幻觉检测等方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖基于文本的指标，但这些指标是否能可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确。需要研究文本指标在SLT评估中的局限性和可靠性。

Method: 通过分析六种评估指标（BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及基于LLM的G-Eval和GEMBA），在三种受控条件下评估其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出中的幻觉、句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在明显局限；LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性，但对LLM释义翻译存在偏见；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例较宽松。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"。需要让LLM在关键领域成为主动的目标导向合作伙伴。

Method: 利用专家轨迹中的观察未来信息推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长视野问题分解为监督学习任务，训练输出(行动，状态评估)元组的策略，控制询问内容和停止时机。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证有效，LLM规模达32B，在线部署后性能甚至优于人类专家，证明框架能将离线数据转化为实际影响。

Conclusion: 该工作为将被动LLM转变为主动目标导向应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个结合微调大语言模型和命名实体识别的管道，用于高效的领域特定文本摘要和标记，特别针对快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战。

Method: 利用LLaMA Factory框架，在通用和自定义领域特定数据集上微调LLMs，特别是在政治和安全领域。

Result: 指令微调显著提升了摘要和标记的准确性，特别是对于专业语料库。LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后超越了中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: LLMs和NER的集成为将非结构化文本转化为可操作的见解提供了强大解决方案，对现代知识管理和安全运营至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: TwinVoice是一个评估LLM在真实世界场景中模拟人物角色的综合基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六项基础能力评估。实验显示先进模型在人物模拟方面表现中等，但在语法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，整体性能远低于人类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的人物模拟评估存在局限性：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、未分析能力需求。为解决这些问题，需要开发一个全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达）。将LLM性能评估分解为六项基础能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、人物语气和语法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物模拟方面达到中等准确度，但在语法风格和记忆回忆等能力上表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基线水平。

Conclusion: 虽然先进LLM在人物模拟方面取得了一定进展，但在关键能力如语法风格和记忆回忆方面仍有明显差距，需要进一步改进才能达到人类水平的模拟能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 探索LLM智能体在信息不对称条件下如何协作完成共同目标，弥补现有研究主要关注单个智能体行动规划的不足。

Method: 采用微调加验证器的框架，为LLM智能体配备不同沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题桌面游戏中测试协作能力。

Result: 研究发现对齐沟通至关重要，无沟通的智能体也能获得高任务完成率但缺乏真正的规则理解；环境验证器能增强智能体的规则理解和任务完成能力。

Conclusion: 通过集成环境验证器可以促进AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作，提高智能体对任务规则的理解能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

TL;DR: FARSIQA是一个用于波斯伊斯兰领域问答的新型端到端系统，采用创新的FAIR-RAG架构，通过自适应查询分解和迭代证据收集来解决复杂多跳查询问题，在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在宗教问答等高风险专业领域应用受限，存在幻觉问题且难以忠实于权威来源，这对波斯语穆斯林社区尤为重要。现有RAG系统在复杂多跳查询上表现不足。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG架构：一个忠实、自适应、迭代优化的RAG框架，采用动态自校正过程，自适应分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，并通过迭代生成子查询逐步填补信息空白。

Result: 在包含超过100万权威伊斯兰文档的知识库上运行，在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中取得最先进性能：负面拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确性得分达74.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为波斯伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构对于在敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的关键作用。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: 为测试时缩放技术在法律领域的应用提供了实证基础，揭示了验证器效用的关键决定因素。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估语言模型推理效率的框架，通过逻辑编程来衡量模型在推理过程中避免不必要推断的能力。研究发现当前语言模型在面对包含无关信息的场景时准确率显著下降，且生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要关注正确性而忽视了推理效率这一关键维度。在真实推理场景中，大量信息是无关的，有效的演绎推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰信息。

Method: 提出了基于逻辑编程的评估框架，通过将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序执行找到的最短证明进行对齐，量化推理效率。构建了包含不同语义重叠度无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验发现当前语言模型在面对包含无关信息的场景时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能。模型生成的证明经常包含通过无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型的推理效率是一个被忽视但重要的评估维度，当前模型在过滤无关信息方面存在不足，需要开发更高效的推理方法。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在分析EHR方面能力有限，存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的问题。

Method: 开发了思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量推理数据，通过多阶段训练范式（领域适应、推理增强和强化学习）构建EHR-R1系列模型。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上超越GPT-4o超过30分，在EHRSHOT上零样本AUROC提高10%，显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要同时处理理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习过程中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；同时检索语义相关的理解样本来构建检索对；提出Pair-GPRO算法，基于相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 构建了16K高质量PairUG数据集，在Janus-Pro等UVLM模型上实现了平衡的改进，优于现有UVLM强化学习基线。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据重组和配对感知优化，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解与生成任务的平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化表格数据分类任务中的适用性，特别是在高风险金融应用如金融风险评估中的表现。

Method: 在真实世界贷款违约预测任务上，系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM梯度提升模型的预测性能，使用SHAP分析特征归因，并评估LLM生成自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，且自解释往往与经验SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为独立模型在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，其自生成解释的可信度值得关注，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人类监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理基准测试通常关注狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估代理在真实世界中处理复杂、多步骤工作流程所需的多样性、真实性和长期复杂性。

Method: 基于高质量MCP服务器集构建，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个手动收集或设计的任务，平均需要约20次交互才能完成，每个任务通过专用评估脚本严格验证。

Result: 评估显示SOTA模型存在显著缺陷：表现最佳的Claude-4.5-Sonnet成功率仅38.6%，平均调用工具20.2次；表现最佳的开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp成功率为20.1%。

Conclusion: Toolathlon有望推动开发更强大的语言代理，以执行现实世界中的长期任务。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [137] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过说服性提示从已进行遗忘学习的大语言模型中恢复事实知识的效果，发现说服性提示能显著增强事实知识回忆，且效果与模型大小呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型遗忘学习效果是一个开放性问题，需要研究如何有效测试遗忘模型的完整性、鲁棒性和行为表现。

Method: 提出了刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架(SKeB)，基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论，通过领域图建模信息纠缠，并开发纠缠度量来量化知识激活模式。

Result: 说服性提示显著增强了事实知识回忆(从14.8%提升到24.5%)，且效果与模型大小呈负相关(2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型仅恢复15%)。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估大语言模型遗忘学习的完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型，通过在潜在空间中进行迭代计算，将推理能力内置到预训练阶段，而不是依赖显式文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这未能充分利用预训练数据，并将推理推迟到训练后阶段。

Method: 使用(i)潜在空间中的迭代计算，(ii)用于学习深度分配的熵正则化目标，(iii)扩展到7.7T tokens的预训练数据。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现优异，匹配了高达12B参数的最先进LLM的结果。

Conclusion: LoopLM作为推理时代的新扩展方向具有潜力，其优势来自更好的知识操作能力而非知识容量增加。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: 提出从一次性任务完成评估转向协作代理评估，引入协作努力扩展框架来衡量代理在用户参与增加时的效用增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估主要关注一次性任务完成，忽略了现实问题固有的迭代和协作性质，人类目标往往不明确且会演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现。

Result: 研究表明最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和支持用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了DiagramEval评估指标，用于评估LLM生成的演示图表质量，将图表建模为图结构，使用节点对齐和路径对齐两个新指标组进行量化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表在论文中至关重要但制作复杂，现有图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表，而LLM生成的SVG图表缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 将图表概念化为图结构，文本元素作为节点，连接关系作为有向边，提出节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标来评估图表质量。

Result: 首次对最先进LLM在近期研究文献上生成的图表进行有效评估，定量证明了所提指标的有效性。

Conclusion: DiagramEval提供了增强的可解释性，为理解LLM生成图表的特性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

TL;DR: DecompTune是一种后训练方法，通过教导模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，显著提升了长文档问答中的归因质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法在抽取式问答中表现良好，但在多跳、抽象和半抽取式场景中表现不佳，这些场景需要跨段落合成信息。

Method: 将事后归因重构为推理问题，通过DecompTune方法进行两阶段SFT + GRPO后训练，使用任务特定的定制奖励。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，优于先前方法，匹配或超过了最先进的前沿模型。

Conclusion: 将归因作为推理问题处理，通过答案分解和定制后训练，能够有效提升复杂问答场景中的归因可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

TL;DR: 发布Gaperon系列法语-英语-编程语言模型，包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练数据达2-4万亿token，完全开源训练流程和中间检查点。研究发现数据过滤与污染对模型性能的影响，并探讨了基准测试泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，研究数据过滤与污染如何影响模型在基准测试和生成任务上的表现。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法语和英语数据集，开发高效数据整理和训练框架，包含数百个中间检查点。通过数据过滤和后期故意污染实验研究性能变化。

Result: 发现语言质量过滤能提升文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染能恢复竞争力分数，仅适度损害生成质量。神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: Gaperon为探索多语言模型开发中数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡提供了可复现的基础，通过完全开源促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 提出了RepoAlign-Bench基准和ReflectCode模型，用于解决代码库级别代码检索问题，在变更请求驱动场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码库复杂性增加，传统函数级搜索无法理解跨组件变更意图，需要新的代码检索方法。

Method: ReflectCode采用对抗反射增强的双塔架构，包含解耦的代码编码器和文档编码器，通过大语言模型引导的反射动态整合语法模式、函数依赖和语义扩展意图。

Result: 在Top-5准确率上提升12.2%，召回率提升7.1%，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 为上下文感知的代码检索开辟了新方向，实现了从函数中心匹配到整体代码库级别推理的范式转变。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern codebases has intensified the need for
retrieval systems capable of interpreting cross-component change intents, a
capability fundamentally absent in conventional function-level search
paradigms. While recent studies have improved the alignment between natural
language queries and code snippets, retrieving contextually relevant code for
specific change requests remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce RepoAlign-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate repository-level code retrieval under change request driven scenarios,
encompassing 52k annotated instances. This benchmark shifts the retrieval
paradigm from function-centric matching to holistic repository-level reasoning.
Furthermore, we propose ReflectCode, an adversarial reflection augmented
dual-tower architecture featuring disentangled code_encoder and doc_encoder
components. ReflectCode dynamically integrates syntactic patterns, function
dependencies, and semantic expansion intents through large language model
guided reflection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ReflectCode
achieves 12.2% improvement in Top-5 Accuracy and 7.1% in Recall over
state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new direction for context-aware code
retrieval.

Conclusion: 为完全自动化、搜索驱动的软件开发奠定了基础，将促进更快的创新和更高效的AI驱动系统发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-assisted software engineering has brought
transformative potential to the field of software engineering, but existing
tools and paradigms remain limited by cognitive overload, inefficient tool
integration, and the narrow capabilities of AI copilots. In response, we
propose Compiler.next, a novel search-based compiler designed to enable the
seamless evolution of AI-native software systems as part of the emerging
Software Engineering 3.0 era. Unlike traditional static compilers,
Compiler.next takes human-written intents and automatically generates working
software by searching for an optimal solution. This process involves dynamic
optimization of cognitive architectures and their constituents (e.g., prompts,
foundation model configurations, and system parameters) while finding the
optimal trade-off between several objectives, such as accuracy, cost, and
latency. This paper outlines the architecture of Compiler.next and positions it
as a cornerstone in democratizing software development by lowering the
technical barrier for non-experts, enabling scalable, adaptable, and reliable
AI-powered software. We present a roadmap to address the core challenges in
intent compilation, including developing quality programming constructs,
effective search heuristics, reproducibility, and interoperability between
compilers. Our vision lays the groundwork for fully automated, search-driven
software development, fostering faster innovation and more efficient AI-driven
systems.

Motivation: 当前LLM应用虽然令人印象深刻，但其不可靠性和产生幻觉内容的倾向阻碍了实际应用。需要软件工程工具来约束LLM输出，提供更强的质量保证。

Method: 开发LLM脚本语言(LSL)作为领域特定语言，用于编程化控制LLM交互，强制执行结构化交互，并与验证、验证和可解释性集成。

Result: 提出了LSL的愿景框架，旨在使LLM交互可编程，并与训练或实现解耦。

Conclusion: LSL可能是改进基于AI应用的关键，通过提供结构化控制和验证机制来解决LLM的可靠性问题。

Abstract: We are witnessing a bloom of AI-powered software driven by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Although the applications of these LLMs are impressive and
seemingly countless, their unreliability hinders adoption. In fact, the
tendency of LLMs to produce faulty or hallucinated content makes them
unsuitable for automating workflows and pipelines. In this regard, Software
Engineering (SE) provides valuable support, offering a wide range of formal
tools to specify, verify, and validate software behaviour. Such SE tools can be
applied to define constraints over LLM outputs and, consequently, offer
stronger guarantees on the generated content. In this paper, we argue that the
development of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for scripting interactions with
LLMs using an LLM Scripting Language (LSL) may be key to improve AI-based
applications. Currently, LLMs and LLM-based software still lack reliability,
robustness, and trustworthiness, and the tools or frameworks to cope with these
issues suffer from fragmentation. In this paper, we present our vision of LSL.
With LSL, we aim to address the limitations above by exploring ways to control
LLM outputs, enforce structure in interactions, and integrate these aspects
with verification, validation, and explainability. Our goal is to make LLM
interaction programmable and decoupled from training or implementation.

Motivation: 将AI辅助自动验证从单函数扩展到更复杂的数据结构模块，解决LLMs对Verus注解语法和验证语义的误解问题。

Method: 使用规划器模块系统生成抽象、类型不变量、规范和证明代码，在提示中嵌入语法指导，并包含修复阶段自动纠正注解错误。

Result: 在11个Rust数据结构模块评估中，成功验证了10个模块，总共128/129个函数（99.2%）。

Conclusion: 这是实现AI辅助形式化验证自动化目标的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax
and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within
prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors.
In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in
total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic
AI-assisted formal verification.

Abstract: The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by
artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate
requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone
to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language
models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer
transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in
RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and
ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study
introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that
integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements
elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use
through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a
multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning
AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary
study presents the conceptual framework and early-stage prototype
implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction
for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and
unstructured RE data in collaborative environments.

TL;DR: BeTaL是一个利用LLM自动化设计动态基准测试的框架，通过参数化基准模板和LLM推理来高效获得目标属性（如难度和真实性），相比静态基准有2-4倍的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手工制作的静态基准测试很快会饱和，而动态基准虽然能随模型进化但创建和更新成本高昂，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: BeTaL框架参数化基准模板的关键设计选择，使用LLM在参数空间中推理以获得目标属性，以成本效益高的方式自动化动态基准设计。

Result: 在三个任务和多个目标难度级别上的广泛评估显示，BeTaL产生的基准与期望难度更接近，平均偏差在5.3%到13.2%之间，比基线改进2-4倍。

Conclusion: BeTaL成功实现了动态基准测试的自动化设计，显著提高了基准测试与目标属性的匹配度，为持续评估LLM能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid progress and widespread deployment of LLMs and LLM-powered agents
has outpaced our ability to evaluate them. Hand-crafted, static benchmarks are
the primary tool for assessing model capabilities, but these quickly become
saturated. In contrast, dynamic benchmarks evolve alongside the models they
evaluate, but are expensive to create and continuously update. To address these
challenges, we develop BeTaL (Benchmark Tuning with an LLM-in-the-loop), a
framework that leverages environment design principles to automate the process
of dynamic benchmark design. BeTaL works by parameterizing key design choices
in base benchmark templates and uses LLMs to reason through the resulting
parameter space to obtain target properties (such as difficulty and realism) in
a cost-efficient manner. We validate this approach on its ability to create
benchmarks with desired difficulty levels. Using BeTaL, we create two new
benchmarks and extend a popular agentic benchmark {\tau} -bench. Extensive
evaluation on these three tasks and multiple target difficulty levels shows
that BeTaL produces benchmarks much closer to the desired difficulty, with
average deviations ranging from 5.3% to 13.2% -- a 2-4x improvement over the
baselines.

Motivation: 编程教育中的抄袭检测面临日益复杂的混淆技术挑战，特别是自动化重构式攻击。现有检测系统对基本混淆有抵抗力，但难以应对保持程序行为的结构性修改。

Method: 利用代码属性图和图变换构建可扩展框架，增强最先进的检测器对抗重构式混淆的能力。

Abstract: Plagiarism detection in programming education faces growing challenges due to
increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques, particularly automated
refactoring-based attacks. While code plagiarism detection systems used in
education practice are resilient against basic obfuscation, they struggle
against structural modifications that preserve program behavior, especially
caused by refactoring-based obfuscation. This paper presents a novel and
extensible framework that enhances state-of-the-art detectors by leveraging
code property graphs and graph transformations to counteract refactoring-based
obfuscation. Our comprehensive evaluation of real-world student submissions,
obfuscated using both algorithmic and AI-based obfuscation attacks,
demonstrates a significant improvement in detecting plagiarized code.

TL;DR: Adapt是一个基于LLM的动态证明精化框架，通过智能选择策略来改进定理证明的自动化程度，相比固定策略方法显著提升了证明成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM证明生成方法使用固定精化策略，无法根据具体证明问题动态选择有效策略，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出Adapt框架，利用LLM引导的决策器根据证明助手状态和错误证明上下文动态选择合适的精化策略。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，Adapt比最佳基线方法分别多证明了16.63%和18.58%的定理，并在五个不同LLM上展现出良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 动态策略选择显著提升了LLM在定理证明中的表现，Adapt框架为形式化验证提供了更有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Formal verification via theorem proving enables the expressive specification
and rigorous proof of software correctness, but it is difficult to scale due to
the significant manual effort and expertise required. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show potential in proof generation, they frequently produce
incorrect proofs on the first attempt and require additional strategies for
iterative refinement. However, existing approaches employ fixed refinement
strategies and cannot dynamically choose an effective strategy based on the
particular issues in a generated proof, which limits their performance. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Adapt, a novel proof refinement
framework that leverages an LLM-guided decision-maker to dynamically select a
suitable refinement strategy according to the state of the proof assistant and
available context of an incorrect proof. We evaluate Adapt on two benchmarks
against four existing methods and find that it significantly outperforms the
best baseline on both by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems, respectively.
Furthermore, we demonstrate Adapt's generalizability by evaluating it across
five different LLMs. We also conduct ablation studies to measure the
contribution of each component and compare the trade-offs of alternative
decision-maker designs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出dcFix方法，使用LLM自动检测和修复REST API误用问题，通过识别违规代码片段并结合API规范生成提示，效果优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者在测试阶段才能发现REST API规范违规，错误信息缺乏细节导致调试困难，需要反复试错。

Method: dcFix识别不符合规范的代码片段，将其与相关API规范整合到提示中，利用大语言模型生成修正后的代码。

Result: 评估显示dcFix能准确检测误用，并且在修复效果上优于基线方法（基线方法在提示中不包含代码违规信息）。

Conclusion: dcFix方法能有效自动修复REST API误用问题，为开发者提供更好的调试支持。

Abstract: Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications.
However, developers often identify specification violations only during
testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective
diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study
proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API
misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code
fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts,
and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our
evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms
the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code
fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.

TL;DR: KUMIC是一个基于上下文学习的框架，通过Chain-of-Thought优化LLMs生成多意图代码注释，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码注释生成的通用概述无法满足开发者多样需求，需要多意图注释生成。现有LLM方法在少量示例中难以构建意图、代码和注释的正确关系。

Method: KUMIC设计检索机制获取高代码-注释一致性的示例，利用CoT引导LLMs关注与特定意图对齐的语句，构建从代码到意图特定语句再到注释的映射知识链。

Result: KUMIC在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE-L和SBERT指标上分别比最先进基线方法提升14.49%、22.41%、20.72%和12.94%。

Conclusion: KUMIC通过优化知识利用和推理步骤，有效解决了多意图代码注释生成问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Code comment generation aims to produce a generic overview of a code snippet,
helping developers understand and maintain code. However, generic summaries
alone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,
developers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled
manner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the
necessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of
Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been
leveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite
their successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to
construct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a
smaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a
framework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation. Built upon
in-context learning, KUMIC leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize
knowledge utilization for LLMs to generate intent-specific comments.
Specifically, KUMIC first designs a retrieval mechanism to obtain similar
demonstration examples, which exhibit high code-comment consistency. Then,
KUMIC leverages CoT to guide LLMs to focus on statements facilitating the
derivation of code comments aligned with specific intents. In this context,
KUMIC constructs a mapping knowledge chain, linking code to intent-specific
statements to comments, which enables LLMs to follow similar reasoning steps
when generating the desired comments. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate KUMIC, and the results demonstrate that KUMIC outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 14.49\%, 22.41\%, 20.72\%, and 12.94\% in terms
of BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SBERT, respectively.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了TECS/Rust-OE框架，通过利用调用流和实时操作系统独占控制机制，在保持内存安全的同时优化性能，解决了原有TECS/Rust框架中过度独占控制导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网发展，嵌入式系统结构日益复杂，需要选择适当的编程语言确保系统可靠性。现有TECS/Rust框架虽然结合了Rust和基于组件的开发，但过度使用独占控制来确保线程安全导致了性能下降。

Method: 提出TECS/Rust-OE框架，利用调用流和实时操作系统独占控制机制，自动生成基于组件描述的Rust代码，优化性能而不牺牲可重用性。

Result: 评估显示，优化的独占控制显著减少了开销，生成的代码具有高可重用性。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust-OE框架成功解决了原有框架的性能问题，在保持内存安全的同时实现了性能优化和高代码可重用性。

Abstract: The diversification of functionalities and the development of the IoT are
making embedded systems larger and more complex in structure. Ensuring system
reliability, especially in terms of security, necessitates selecting an
appropriate programming language. As part of existing research, TECS/Rust has
been proposed as a framework that combines Rust and component-based development
(CBD) to enable scalable system design and enhanced reliability. This framework
represents system structures using static mutable variables, but excessive
exclusive controls applied to ensure thread safety have led to performance
degradation. This paper proposes TECS/Rust-OE, a memory-safe CBD framework
utilizing call flows to address these limitations. The proposed Rust code
leverages real-time OS exclusive control mechanisms, optimizing performance
without compromising reusability. Rust code is automatically generated based on
component descriptions. Evaluations demonstrate reduced overhead due to
optimized exclusion control and high reusability of the generated code.

TL;DR: 提出了TECS/Rust框架，将Rust的内存安全特性集成到嵌入式系统组件框架TECS中，以解决C语言内存安全问题，同时保持组件开发的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统复杂性增加，基于组件的开发(CBD)成为解决方案，但C语言存在内存安全问题。需要结合Rust的内存安全特性来提升嵌入式系统开发的安全性。

Method: 开发了基于Rust的TECS/Rust框架，利用Rust的编译时内存安全特性（生命周期和借用检查），自动为CBD组件生成Rust代码，并支持与实时操作系统的集成。

Result: 生成的代码占实际代码的很大比例，与不使用该框架开发的代码相比，执行时间差异极小，引入的开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: TECS/Rust框架成功将Rust的内存安全特性集成到嵌入式系统组件开发中，在保证内存安全的同时保持了开发效率和性能。

Abstract: As embedded systems grow in complexity and scale due to increased functional
diversity, component-based development (CBD) emerges as a solution to
streamline their architecture and enhance functionality reuse. CBD typically
utilizes the C programming language for its direct hardware access and
low-level operations, despite its susceptibility to memory-related issues. To
address these concerns, this paper proposes TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework
specifically designed for TECS, which is a component framework for embedded
systems. It leverages Rust's compile-time memory-safe features, such as
lifetime and borrowing, to mitigate memory vulnerabilities common with C. The
proposed framework not only ensures memory safety but also maintains the
flexibility of CBD, automates Rust code generation for CBD components, and
supports efficient integration with real-time operating systems. An evaluation
of the amount of generated code indicates that the code generated by this paper
framework accounts for a large percentage of the actual code. Compared to code
developed without the proposed framework, the difference in execution time is
minimal, indicating that the overhead introduced by the proposed framework is
negligible.

*Hidetake Tanaka,Haruto Tanaka,Kazumasa Shimari,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究比较了基于属性的测试(PBT)和基于示例的测试(EBT)在检测LLM生成代码边缘案例方面的效果。实验发现单独使用任一种方法检测率为68.75%，而结合使用可提升至81.25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在软件开发中生成代码的普及，确保LLM生成代码质量变得重要。传统基于示例的测试方法常常遗漏边缘案例，包括边界值、特殊输入模式和极端条件下的缺陷。

Method: 分析了16个HumanEval问题，使用Claude-4-sonnet生成PBT和EBT测试代码，比较它们在检测标准解决方案在扩展测试用例中失败的能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，PBT和EBT单独使用时都达到了68.75%的错误检测率，但结合使用时检测率提升到81.25%。PBT擅长检测性能问题和通过广泛输入空间探索发现边缘案例，而EBT擅长检测特定边界条件和特殊模式。

Conclusion: 结合使用PBT和EBT的混合方法可以提高LLM生成代码的可靠性，为LLM基于代码生成的测试策略提供指导。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate code in software
development, ensuring the quality of LLM-generated code has become important.
Traditional testing approaches using Example-based Testing (EBT) often miss
edge cases -- defects that occur at boundary values, special input patterns, or
extreme conditions. This research investigates the characteristics of
LLM-generated Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to EBT for exploring edge
cases. We analyze 16 HumanEval problems where standard solutions failed on
extended test cases, generating both PBT and EBT test codes using
Claude-4-sonnet. Our experimental results reveal that while each method
individually achieved a 68.75\% bug detection rate, combining both approaches
improved detection to 81.25\%. The analysis demonstrates complementary
characteristics: PBT effectively detects performance issues and edge cases
through extensive input space exploration, while EBT effectively detects
specific boundary conditions and special patterns. These findings suggest that
a hybrid approach leveraging both testing methods can improve the reliability
of LLM-generated code, providing guidance for test generation strategies in
LLM-based code generation.

TL;DR: Prometheus是一个AI辅助的自动化代码验证系统，通过模块化重构将复杂程序分解为可验证的小组件，然后重新组合证明原始程序，显著提高了验证成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化验证对构建可靠软件系统至关重要，但需要专业知识且成本高昂。现代AI系统能够识别数学证明模式和理解自然语言，但如何有效整合到形式化验证过程中仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用分解-重组工作流：将复杂程序逻辑（如嵌套循环）分解为可验证的小组件，验证后重新组合构建原始程序证明。当自动化工具不足时，用户可提供轻量级自然语言指导来引导证明过程。

Result: 在精选数据集中成功验证了86%的任务（基线为68%）。随着规范复杂度的增加，验证成功率从30%提升到69%；在集成复杂程序证明大纲时，从25%提升到87%。

Conclusion: 通过模块化重构代码可以显著提高AI验证单个组件的有效性，证明了AI辅助形式化验证的可行性，特别是在处理复杂规范时效果更加明显。

Abstract: Formal verification is increasingly recognized as a critical foundation for
building reliable software systems. However, the need for specialized expertise
to write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn
annotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than
implementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical
proofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the
formal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a
novel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with
current AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering
principles (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing
complex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable
components. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof
of the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is
non-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through
structured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.
When automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural
language guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code
substantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual
components. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated
dataset, compared to 68% for the baseline. Gains are more pronounced with
increasing specification complexity, improving from 30% to 69%, and when
integrating proof outlines for complex programs, from 25% to 87%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理系统虽然前景广阔，但开发者在构建、部署和维护过程中面临持续且未被充分探索的挑战，需要系统性地识别这些挑战以提供指导。

Method: 通过标签扩展和筛选构建挑战分类法，应用LDA-MALLET进行主题建模，手动验证和标注主题，分析2021-2025年间的开发者讨论数据。

Result: 识别出7大领域77个技术挑战，量化了主题流行度和难度，绘制了代理开发使用的工具和编程语言地图，并追踪了其与主要AI模型和框架发布的演变关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者、研究人员和教育工作者在代理可靠性和开发者支持方面提供了具体指导，有助于改善AI代理系统的开发实践。

Abstract: AI agents have rapidly gained popularity across research and industry as
systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan,
use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise,
developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building,
deploying, and maintaining these emerging systems. To identify these
challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's
largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and
answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges
through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and
manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven
major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges
related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration
complexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity
and difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve,
map the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track
their evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework
releases. Finally, we present the implications of our results, offering
concrete guidance for practitioners, researchers, and educators on agent
reliability and developer support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在学术界和工业界的广泛应用，进行基于LLM的实证研究面临可复现性挑战。本研究旨在评估当前LLM研究的可复现性程度，并识别阻碍可复现性的因素。

Method: 选取ICSE 2024和ASE 2024会议上发表的86篇LLM相关研究，筛选出18篇提供研究工件并使用OpenAI模型的文章，尝试复现这些研究。

Result: 在18篇研究中，仅5篇适合复现，但没有一篇能完全复现结果。其中2篇部分可复现，3篇不可复现。

Conclusion: 当前LLM研究的可复现性状况堪忧，需要更严格的研究工件评估和更稳健的研究设计，以确保未来发表成果的可复现价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models have gained remarkable interest in industry and
academia. The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the
number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone
78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs.
Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions
on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and
practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on
LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current
research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede
reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We
contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide
insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on
how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles
describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86
articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted
to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for
reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the
results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did
not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for
stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs
to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.

TL;DR: GreenAFL是一个能量感知的模糊测试框架，通过将功耗纳入模糊测试启发式算法，在保持覆盖率的同时减少自动化测试的环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灰盒模糊测试方法如AFL++主要关注覆盖率最大化，而不考虑探索不同执行路径的能源成本，导致持续模糊测试消耗大量计算资源并产生显著的碳足迹。

Method: GreenAFL引入两个关键修改：能量感知的语料库最小化（在减少初始语料库时考虑功耗）和能量引导的启发式算法（将变异导向高覆盖率、低能耗的输入）。

Result: 消融研究表明，使用至少一个修改组件时，能够实现最高覆盖率和最低能耗。

Conclusion: 将能量消耗纳入模糊测试启发式算法可以有效减少环境影响，同时保持测试覆盖率。

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a key search-based technique for software testing, but
continuous fuzzing campaigns consume substantial computational resources and
generate significant carbon footprints. Existing grey-box fuzzing approaches
like AFL++ focus primarily on coverage maximisation, without considering the
energy costs of exploring different execution paths. This paper presents
GreenAFL, an energy-aware framework that incorporates power consumption into
the fuzzing heuristics to reduce the environmental impact of automated testing
whilst maintaining coverage. GreenAFL introduces two key modifications to
traditional fuzzing workflows: energy-aware corpus minimisation considering
power consumption when reducing initial corpora, and energy-guided heuristics
that direct mutation towards high-coverage, low-energy inputs. We conduct an
ablation study comparing vanilla AFL++, energy-based corpus minimisation, and
energy-based heuristics to evaluate the individual contributions of each
component. Results show that highest coverage, and lowest energy usage is
achieved whenever at least one of our modifications is used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在无线电定位中存在的实验规范不严谨、可复现性差的问题，填补低编码工作量、默认可复现性和内置可扩展性之间的三向差距。

Method: 采用基于人类可读配置的声明式实验设计，工作流编排器运行从数据准备到报告的标准化流水线，所有工件（数据集、模型、指标、报告）都进行版本控制。

Result: 与普通Jupyter笔记本基线相比，该框架减少了编写工作量，同时保持相当的运行时间和内存行为；在BLE数据集上的扩展实验显示，随着数据量增长（1倍到10倍），编排开销保持有界。

Conclusion: LOCALIZE框架使基于机器学习的可复现定位实验变得实用、易访问和可扩展。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization
services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should
make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,
without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers
face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low
coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including
versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,
and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,
metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing
tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization
workflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,
configuration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are
declared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs
standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,
such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The
preconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,
speeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension
points, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.
In a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter
notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while
maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a
Bluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to
10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the
framework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization
experimentation practical, accessible, and extensible.

Motivation: 现有的基准只评估端到端的构建/测试成功，无法揭示代理在何处及为何成功或失败，环境配置仍然是软件工程的瓶颈。

Method: 通过注入真实的README错误自动构建任务实例，在Docker中验证，结合过程级分析和端到端可执行性来评估代理能力。

Result: 评估显示代理能够定位错误，但难以将反馈转化为有效修正，限制了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Enconda-bench是首个为环境配置提供过程级内部能力评估的框架，为改进软件工程代理提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

Motivation: 通过分析网络望远镜收集的扫描和反向散射流量，了解全球威胁活动、大规模探测行为、数据中断和持续DoS攻击活动。

Method: 采用粗到细方法，建立两个子管道：资源高效的元数据子管道提取一般见解，更详细的包头子管道进行细粒度分析。

Result: 揭示了长期趋势和反复出现的流量峰值，部分归因于互联网范围的扫描事件，其他可能与DoS活动相关。

Conclusion: 该数据集提供了全球威胁活动的独特视角，方法论支持对近20年望远镜数据的可扩展处理和多层次流量动态探索。

Abstract: This paper presents an initial longitudinal analysis of unsolicited Internet
traffic collected between 2005 and 2025 by one of the largest and most
persistent network telescopes in the United States, operated by Merit Network.
The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed
through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing
behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To
process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which
general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata
sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for
finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable
scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports
multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight
long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to
Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We
present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of
traffic characteristics during 2024.

TL;DR: MMM-Fact是一个大规模多模态事实核查基准，包含125,449个经过事实核查的声明（1995-2025年），每个声明都配有完整的事实核查文章和多模态证据（文本、图像、视频、表格），支持多步骤跨模态推理的公平评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准存在不足：主要是单模态（仅文本）、时间跨度短、证据浅层、领域覆盖不均、常省略完整文章，无法反映模型在真实世界中的能力。需要更全面、真实的事实核查基准。

Method: 从四个事实核查网站和一个新闻机构收集数据，采用三层检索难度分类（基础1-5个来源、中级6-10个、高级>10个），使用三类真实性标签（真实/虚假/信息不足），支持真实性预测、可解释事实核查、复杂证据聚合和纵向分析等任务。

Result: 主流LLM的基线测试显示MMM-Fact明显比现有资源更难，随着证据复杂度的增加，性能会下降。数据集支持透明、可靠的多模态事实核查。

Conclusion: MMM-Fact提供了一个真实、可扩展的基准，用于透明、可靠的多模态事实核查，填补了现有基准的不足，能够更准确地评估模型在复杂现实场景中的表现。

Abstract: Misinformation and disinformation demand fact checking that goes beyond
simple evidence-based reasoning. Existing benchmarks fall short: they are
largely single modality (text-only), span short time horizons, use shallow
evidence, cover domains unevenly, and often omit full articles -- obscuring
models' real-world capability. We present MMM-Fact, a large-scale benchmark of
125,449 fact-checked statements (1995--2025) across multiple domains, each
paired with the full fact-check article and multimodal evidence (text, images,
videos, tables) from four fact-checking sites and one news outlet. To reflect
verification effort, each statement is tagged with a retrieval-difficulty tier
-- Basic (1--5 sources), Intermediate (6--10), and Advanced (>10) -- supporting
fairness-aware evaluation for multi-step, cross-modal reasoning. The dataset
adopts a three-class veracity scheme (true/false/not enough information) and
enables tasks in veracity prediction, explainable fact-checking, complex
evidence aggregation, and longitudinal analysis. Baselines with mainstream LLMs
show MMM-Fact is markedly harder than prior resources, with performance
degrading as evidence complexity rises. MMM-Fact offers a realistic, scalable
benchmark for transparent, reliable, multimodal fact-checking.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究提出基于网络理论的计算方法，分析社交媒体中情绪网络在危机期间（地震、疫苗接种）和正常时期的动态变化，发现情绪网络结构在群体层面保持稳定，挑战了情绪共现依赖情境的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索危机期间和正常时期社交媒体中情绪网络如何演化，理解情绪共现的内在结构，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 利用网络理论，分析日本社交媒体大规模数据，通过情绪相关概念（词汇）的共现识别情绪间链接，比较地震、COVID-19疫苗接种等危机事件与非危机时期的数据。

Result: 发现情绪网络在群体层面具有跨情境和跨时间的稳定结构，某些情绪链接（如紧张相关）在危机期间显著增强，但情绪链接的排序保持高度稳定。

Conclusion: 情绪共现可能具有内在结构而非完全依赖情境，网络分析框架为利用大规模文本数据进行心理学研究提供了系统化、可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Examining emotion interactions as an emotion network in social media offers
key insights into human psychology, yet few studies have explored how
fluctuations in such emotion network evolve during crises and normal times.
This study proposes a novel computational approach grounded in network theory,
leveraging large-scale Japanese social media data spanning varied crisis events
(earthquakes and COVID-19 vaccination) and non-crisis periods over the past
decade. Our analysis identifies and evaluates links between emotions through
the co-occurrence of emotion-related concepts (words), revealing a stable
structure of emotion network across situations and over time at the population
level. We find that some emotion links (represented as link strength) such as
emotion links associated with Tension are significantly strengthened during
earthquake and pre-vaccination periods. However, the rank of emotion links
remains highly intact. These findings challenge the assumption that emotion
co-occurrence is context-based and offer a deeper understanding of emotions'
intrinsic structure. Moreover, our network-based framework offers a systematic,
scalable method for analyzing emotion co-occurrence dynamics, opening new
avenues for psychological research using large-scale textual data.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于有界度数模体计数的多项式时间测试方法，用于检测两个Erdős-Rényi图之间的相关性，突破了现有方法对相关系数的限制要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相关性分析是从复杂数据集中提取有意义见解的基础步骤。本文旨在解决检测两个Erdős-Rényi图之间相关性的问题，该问题被表述为一个假设检验问题。

Method: 通过计数有界度数模体来开发多项式时间测试方法。有界度数模体在真实网络中普遍存在，使得所提出的统计量既自然又可扩展。

Result: 当边连接概率满足p≥n^{-2/3}时，该方法对任何常数相关系数ρ都有效，克服了现有方法要求ρ≥√α（α≈0.338为Otter常数）的限制。在合成和真实共引网络上的验证进一步证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 有界度数模体这一简单模体家族能有效捕捉相关性信号，并展现出强大的实证性能，为图相关性检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Correlation analysis is a fundamental step for extracting meaningful insights
from complex datasets. In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting
correlation between two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$, formulated as a
hypothesis testing problem: under the null hypothesis, the two graphs are
independent, while under the alternative hypothesis, they are correlated. We
develop a polynomial-time test by counting bounded degree motifs and prove its
effectiveness for any constant correlation coefficient $\rho$ when the edge
connecting probability satisfies $p\ge n^{-2/3}$. Our results overcome the
limitation requiring $\rho \ge \sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is
the Otter's constant, extending it to any constant $\rho$. Methodologically,
bounded degree motifs -- ubiquitous in real networks -- make the proposed
statistic both natural and scalable. We also validate our method on synthetic
and real co-citation networks, further confirming that this simple motif family
effectively captures correlation signals and exhibits strong empirical
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Apache Spark的高效分布式网络嵌入算法，通过递归分割大图为小规模子图并行处理，显著提升了大规模图处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络嵌入方法难以高效处理大规模图，主要因为图计算成本高且中间结果过大，无法在单机上处理。

Method: 使用Apache Spark分布式框架，递归将大图分割成小规模子图，并行计算每个子图的网络嵌入，最后聚合所有子图输出得到节点嵌入。

Result: 能够处理数十亿边的大图，处理时间仅需数小时，比现有最优方法快至少4倍；在链接预测和节点分类任务上分别提升4.25%和4.27%；在腾讯在线游戏应用中，运行时间提升91.11%，评估指标提升12.80%。

Conclusion: 该分布式网络嵌入算法在大规模图处理中具有显著优势，在效率和效果上都超越了现有方法，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Network embedding has been widely used in social recommendation and network
analysis, such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs.
However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently,
due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of
graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large,
rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding
on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into
several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural
information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph
in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain
the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various
experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions
of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the
state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\%$ and $4.27\%$
improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In
the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with
the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which
improve the competitors by up to $91.11\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\%$
in the corresponding evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理树结构的RLVR数据调度方法Re-Schedule，通过r-score度量查询学习难度，构建从简单到复杂的课程学习，在数学推理基准上提升准确率最高达3.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标对查询排序，忽略了查询的推理树结构信息，需要更强大的调度基础。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)度量查询学习难度，基于此提出推理树调度算法(Re-Schedule)，构建从结构简单(高r-score)到复杂(低r-score)的课程学习。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，Re-Schedule显著提升平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%。

Conclusion: 推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

TL;DR: 研究循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理，针对包含反馈环的真实系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实推理框架假设无环结构因果模型，但许多真实系统（如生物系统）包含违反无环性的反馈循环

Method: 在循环结构因果模型中研究反事实推理，特别关注位移-尺度干预（软性、策略式变化）

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理是一个重要研究方向

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: ProFees是一个基于LLM的框架，用于自动化医疗评估与管理(E/M)编码任务，在真实数据集上比商业系统提高了36%以上的编码准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻医生的文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理质量。E/M编码虽然是辅助任务，但增加了医生的工作负担。

Method: 开发了基于大语言模型(LLM)的ProFees框架，专门解决E/M编码中的现实复杂性。

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统提高了36%以上的编码准确率，比最强的单提示基线提高了近5%。

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的现实复杂性，展示了其在医疗计费自动化方面的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过显式状态跟踪和占位符后处理，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中遵循程序流程的问题，实现高状态合规性和计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在动态游戏交互中无法遵循规则治理的交易系统程序流程（浏览-报价-审核-确认），这会削弱玩家信任。需要解决LLM创意灵活性与程序性交易需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM显式化其状态跟踪过程，要求LLM识别并报告前一轮的预定义状态标签。结合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，状态合规性>99%，计算精度达99.3%。小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)使用ASTP和占位符后处理可匹配大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)性能，同时将响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP为商业游戏建立了实用基础，既满足实时需求又符合资源约束，在保持高状态合规性和计算精度的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练奖励方案通常只关注结果，缺乏对推理过程的监督，限制了模型推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算一致性奖励，衡量策略模型推理过程与预训练教师模型的对齐程度，结合标准答案/格式奖励进行群体相对策略优化。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘进行推理感知的GRPO能够有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1通过多阶段课程强化学习，在仅使用结果监督的情况下训练LLM，使其能够在知识库上自主进行代理推理，显著提升了KBQA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督合成推理轨迹来微调LLMs，这种方法探索激励不足，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 首先基于结果拒绝采样获得高质量轨迹进行微调，然后应用多阶段课程强化学习，采用从易到难的奖励调度来缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上实现了11.1%的相对改进，仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 仅使用结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库上自主代理推理的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 将智能体方法扩展到安全对齐领域，解决现有静态方法只能提供二元分类（安全/不安全）的局限性，实现更强大的多模态系统安全防御

Method: 引入包含Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector的动态协作代理框架，实现模型无关的上下文感知调节

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不遵循率

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过智能体架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了智能体系统作为自动安全治理基础的潜力

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出RAVR框架，利用答案引导的推理作为变分替代方法，解决LLM在超出当前能力范围的任务中难以生成高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM面对超出其当前能力的任务时，难以生成高质量的推理路径。受认知科学启发，"为什么这是答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为前者避免了开放式探索的认知负担，专注于解释性重建。

Method: 提出RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过答案引导生成高质量推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线方法表现出一致的改进。分析显示RAVR减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案引导的推理能够显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，为LLM推理能力提升提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA是一个基于LLM的多代理进化系统，用于从复杂的工业事件日志数据中自动提取高性能特征，解决了传统自动特征工程方法在可解释性、操作灵活性和异构数据适应性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据具有大规模、高维度、数据类型多样和复杂时空结构的特点，使得特征工程极具挑战性。现有的自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化和对异构数据适应性不足的问题。

Method: FELA采用多代理系统，包括创意代理、代码代理、批评代理和评估代理，结合LLM的推理和编码能力，通过洞察引导的自进化范式进行特征生成、验证和实施。系统还引入了代理进化算法，结合强化学习和遗传算法原理来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释的、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能，同时减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统有潜力成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: 开发了PsyCoTalk，首个支持共病诊断的大规模对话数据集，包含3000个多轮诊断对话，通过合成EMR和多智能体框架构建，经精神科医生验证具有高真实性和诊断有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神疾病共病在临床上很重要但具有挑战性，需要处理多种同时发生的复杂疾病。

Method: 整合合成患者电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成，将临床访谈协议转化为分层状态机和上下文树，支持130多个诊断状态。

Result: 构建了502个合成EMR和3000个多轮诊断对话，与真实临床记录相比在对话长度、标记分布和诊断推理策略方面具有高保真度，精神科医生确认了对话的真实性和诊断有效性。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk数据集提高了诊断准确性和治疗规划，为精神疾病共病研究提供了宝贵资源，支持单次对话中多疾病筛查模型的开发和评估。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图规划实现工具并行执行，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理（如ReAct）采用顺序推理执行，无法利用独立子任务间的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳

Method: 构建图规划框架，将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）学习并行和串行工具执行策略

Result: 在MHQA数据集上显著超越传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务中，通过智能并行化大幅提升工具调用效率

Conclusion: 图规划方法能够有效建模任务间依赖关系，实现自适应并行执行，为工具增强型LLM代理提供了更高效的推理范式

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，在MCTS中检测更多抽象状态-动作对，相比OGA-UCT显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，从而影响了MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出了KVDA框架，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，允许分组具有不同价值但价值差异可推断的状态和状态-动作对，并基于此修改OGA-UCT得到KVDA-UCT算法。

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下检测到的抽象数量显著多于OGA-UCT，且性能优于OGA-UCT，没有引入额外参数。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，能够发现更多抽象，有效提升了MCTS的样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双范式框架，将智能体AI系统分为符号/经典范式（基于算法规划和持久状态）和神经/生成范式（基于随机生成和提示驱动编排），并通过系统文献回顾分析了两种范式在理论基础、领域应用和伦理治理方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体AI快速发展导致的认知碎片化问题，澄清现代神经系统与过时符号模型之间的概念混淆（概念翻新），为领域提供清晰的理论框架。

Method: 采用PRISMA系统文献回顾方法，分析了2018-2025年间的90项研究，从三个维度构建双范式分析框架：理论基础与架构原则、领域特定实现、范式特定伦理与治理挑战。

Result: 发现范式选择具有战略意义：符号系统主导安全关键领域（如医疗），神经系统主导自适应、数据丰富的环境（如金融）；识别出符号系统治理模型缺失和神经符号混合架构需求等关键研究空白。

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，为未来研究、开发和政策提供概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AI对齐研究的新视角：将工具性目标视为需要接受和管理的特征，而非需要限制的故障。基于亚里士多德本体论，认为高级AI系统的构成自然会产生工具性倾向，应将其引导至人类对齐的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险来源，试图限制其症状。本文认为这种观点存在问题，需要重新思考工具性目标的本质。

Method: 运用亚里士多德本体论及其现代解释，构建哲学论证框架，将AI系统视为具有具体目标导向的实体，分析其形式与物质构成产生的必然结果。

Result: 论证了工具性目标是AI系统构成的必然结果，而非偶然故障。提出了从限制转向理解、管理和引导的新思路。

Conclusion: AI对齐研究应减少消除工具性目标的努力，更多关注如何理解、管理和引导这些目标朝向人类对齐的最终目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTIR-SQL框架，这是一个多轮工具集成推理的强化学习框架，用于Text-to-SQL任务。该框架通过在每个推理步骤中整合数据库执行反馈，实现上下文敏感的查询生成和渐进式优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性，从而提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了执行感知的多轮推理范式，在推理过程中无缝整合数据库执行反馈。扩展了GRPO算法以适应复杂多轮交互场景，并添加了轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Result: MTIR-SQL在BIRD Dev上达到64.4%的准确率，在SPIDER Dev上达到84.6%的执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过多轮工具集成推理和动态反馈机制，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法会产生包含未命名谓词的规则，这阻碍了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用大语言模型处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议。

Result: 在手工制作的逻辑规则上评估表明，大语言模型在这项任务上具有潜力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够为逻辑规则中的未命名谓词生成有意义的名称，有助于提高逻辑理论的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: 所提出的零强化学习范式能够有效提升模型在可验证和不可验证领域的推理能力，实现推理能力在不同领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的转移经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

### [191] [ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668)
*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个基于强化学习的多轮交互框架，通过微调视觉语言模型使其能够主动导航长文档，引入页面直接访问功能，并采用跨层级奖励和视觉语义锚定机制来提升训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨多页信息整合的长文档时表现不佳，通常依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ALDEN框架，包含：1）fetch动作直接按索引访问页面；2）基于规则的跨层级奖励机制；3）视觉语义锚定机制通过双路径KL散度约束稳定训练。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的智能代理的转变，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

TL;DR: 基于深度强化学习的无人机最优导航策略，在三维城市湍流环境中显著提高了成功率并降低了碰撞率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机在城市区域配送和监控应用中的普及，需要开发能够在复杂湍流环境中有效导航的策略

Method: 使用结合GTrXL架构的流感知PPO算法，为智能体提供更丰富的湍流场信息，并与PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL和传统Zermelo导航算法进行对比

Result: 相比PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL和传统Zermelo算法，该方法显著提高了成功率(SR)并降低了碰撞率(CR)

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂城市环境中无人机导航开辟了新途径，有望重塑无人机应用格局

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG是一种带频率权重的知识图谱，通过非三元组边减少信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成中独立处理检索块、难以进行多跳或关系推理的问题，同时克服传统知识图谱因三元组结构限制导致的信息丢失问题。

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上应用基于频率的权重，体现连接强度，借鉴赫布原理的"一起激发，一起连接"思想。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权非三元组边有效提升了知识图谱的推理能力，特别是在跨文档关系推理方面。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略性自适应代理，采用新颖的双循环架构来解决现有方法在情感理解、自适应策略和多会话治疗方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询大语言模型缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和跨会话治疗能力，与真实临床实践存在较大差距。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中的评估显示，TheraMind在多会话指标（如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性）上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计有效模拟了战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为，验证了该方法在心理咨询中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 基于PPO的深度强化学习框架，用于5G无线接入网络中的自主QoS感知负载均衡，在轻量级Python仿真环境中实现端到端控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集、高度动态的5G无线接入网络中，高效的移动性管理和负载均衡对于维持服务质量至关重要。

Method: 将控制问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法训练actor-critic神经网络，通过周期性调整小区个体偏移值来引导用户-小区关联。

Result: 在500多个训练周期和用户密度增加的应力测试中，PPO策略持续改善KPI趋势（更高吞吐量和公平性，更低延迟、抖动、丢包率和切换次数），并表现出快速稳定的收敛。

Conclusion: PPO的裁剪策略更新和基于优势的训练为下一代RAN负载均衡提供了稳健、可部署的控制方案，使用完全基于Python的工具链。

Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining
Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We
present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented
end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control
problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent
periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell
associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators
(aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness
index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances
efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO
agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated
by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and
stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests
with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends
(higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and
handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show
that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based
CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and
stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's
clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable
control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based
toolchain.

TL;DR: 评估Dropbox、Google Drive和OneDrive在Wi-Fi和LTE网络条件下多媒体文件上传的性能，Google Drive表现最稳定，Dropbox带宽利用率高但LTE延迟大，OneDrive对网络波动敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解云存储服务在不同网络条件下的性能表现，特别是多媒体文件上传时的关键指标差异。

Method: 使用Wireshark捕获流量，分析延迟、抖动、带宽和丢包率等关键指标，并采用双泊松函数对数据包大小分布进行建模。

Result: Google Drive在两种网络中表现最一致，延迟低且抖动小；Dropbox带宽利用率高但LTE延迟较大；OneDrive行为多变，对移动网络波动敏感；Wi-Fi连接更稳定。

Conclusion: Wi-Fi为多媒体传输提供更稳定的连接，LTE性能因平台实现而异；需要更大数据集和异构接入网络进行进一步分析。

Abstract: The performance of Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive cloud storage services
was evaluated under Wi-Fi and LTE network conditions during multimedia file
uploads. Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including
delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive
maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks,
showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth
utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater
number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with
elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile
network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using
a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater
stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on
platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better
understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and
suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access
networks.

TL;DR: 本文对学习型拥塞控制算法进行了系统性研究，通过与TCP Cubic和BBR等传统算法对比，揭示了现有学习型方法的优势和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型拥塞控制（包括强化学习）在快速变化的网络环境中具有潜力，但尚处于早期阶段，需要深入研究其局限性和挑战，以开发可部署的解决方案。

Method: 建立了可复现的系统性评估方法，对公开可用的学习型拥塞控制方法进行大规模实验，并与TCP Cubic和BBR v3等传统算法直接对比。

Conclusion: 学习型拥塞控制研究需要更多透明度与可复现性，当前方法在动态网络条件下仍存在局限性，需要进一步改进以适用于真实网络环境。

Abstract: Learning-based congestion control (CC), including Reinforcement-Learning,
promises efficient CC in a fast-changing networking landscape, where evolving
communication technologies, applications and traffic workloads pose severe
challenges to human-derived, static CC algorithms. Learning-based CC is in its
early days and substantial research is required to understand existing
limitations, identify research challenges and, eventually, yield deployable
solutions for real-world networks. In this paper, we extend our prior work and
present a reproducible and systematic study of learning-based CC with the aim
to highlight strengths and uncover fundamental limitations of the
state-of-the-art. We directly contrast said approaches with widely deployed,
human-derived CC algorithms, namely TCP Cubic and BBR (version 3). We identify
challenges in evaluating learning-based CC, establish a methodology for
studying said approaches and perform large-scale experimentation with
learning-based CC approaches that are publicly available. We show that
embedding fairness directly into reward functions is effective; however, the
fairness properties do not generalise into unseen conditions. We then show that
RL learning-based approaches existing approaches can acquire all available
bandwidth while largely maintaining low latency. Finally, we highlight that
existing the latest learning-based CC approaches under-perform when the
available bandwidth and end-to-end latency dynamically change while remaining
resistant to non-congestive loss. As with our initial study, our
experimentation codebase and datasets are publicly available with the aim to
galvanise the research community towards transparency and reproducibility,
which have been recognised as crucial for researching and evaluating
machine-generated policies.

Conclusion: 该解决方案结合了高检测精度和低延迟推理，适用于现实网络中可扩展的实时蜂窝物联网应用。

Abstract: Preamble collision in the random access channel (RACH) is a major bottleneck
in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenarios, typical of cellular IoT
(CIoT) deployments. This work proposes a machine learning-based mechanism for
early collision detection during the random access (RA) procedure. A labeled
dataset was generated using the RA procedure messages exchanged between the
users and the base station under realistic channel conditions, simulated in
MATLAB. We evaluate nine classic classifiers -- including tree ensembles,
support vector machines, and neural networks -- across four communication
scenarios, varying both channel characteristics (e.g., Doppler spread,
multipath) and the cell coverage radius, to emulate realistic propagation,
mobility, and spatial conditions. The neural network outperformed all other
models, achieving over 98\% balanced accuracy in the in-distribution evaluation
(train and test drawn from the same dataset) and sustaining 95\% under
out-of-distribution evaluation (train/test from different datasets). To enable
deployment on typical base station hardware, we apply post-training
quantization. Full integer quantization reduced inference time from 2500 ms to
as low as 0.3 ms with negligible accuracy loss. The proposed solution combines
high detection accuracy with low-latency inference, making it suitable for
scalable, real-time CIoT applications found in real networks.

Motivation: 当前5G网络中专家设计的SSB码本虽然提供了稳健的基线，但在动态或异构环境中缺乏灵活性，限制了整体效能。需要一种能够适应实际环境变化的自适应码本设计方法。

Method: 采用混合强化学习框架，在专家知识基础上，RL代理利用专家设计的SSB波束池，根据实时反馈自适应地选择或组合波束，同时始终遵守实际波束约束。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比静态专家配置，所提方法平均提高了10.8%的用户连接性能。

Conclusion: 将专家知识与数据驱动优化相结合，能够实现下一代无线网络中更智能、灵活和弹性的波束管理。

Abstract: Initial access (IA) is the process by which user equipment (UE) establishes
its first connection with a base station. In 5G systems, particularly at
millimeter-wave frequencies, IA integrates beam management to support highly
directional transmissions. The base station employs a codebook of beams for the
transmission of Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), which are periodically
swept to detect and connect users. The design of this SSB codebook is critical
for ensuring reliable, wide-area coverage. In current networks, SSB codebooks
are meticulously engineered by domain experts. While these expert-defined
codebooks provide a robust baseline, they lack flexibility in dynamic or
heterogeneous environments where user distributions vary, limiting their
overall effectiveness. This paper proposes a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for adaptive SSB codebook design. Building on top of expert
knowledge, the RL agent leverages a pool of expert-designed SSB beams and
learns to adaptively select or combine them based on real-time feedback. This
enables the agent to dynamically tailor codebooks to the actual environment,
without requiring explicit user location information, while always respecting
practical beam constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average,
the proposed approach improves user connectivity by 10.8$\%$ compared to static
expert configurations. These findings highlight the potential of combining
expert knowledge with data-driven optimization to achieve more intelligent,
flexible, and resilient beam management in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: TCP ROCCET是TCP CUBIC的延迟感知扩展，在蜂窝网络中通过结合RTT和丢包来缓解缓冲膨胀问题，相比标准CUBIC降低延迟，与BBRv3相比提供相似吞吐量但更低延迟。

Motivation: 现代蜂窝网络中，TCP CUBIC等基于丢包的拥塞控制算法面临挑战，由于RLC层大缓冲区导致缓冲膨胀，影响慢启动和拥塞避免阶段性能。

Method: 提出TCP ROCCET，作为TCP CUBIC的延迟感知扩展，基于往返时间（RTT）和丢包来响应网络拥塞。

Result: 在真实5G网络（包括静止和移动场景）评估显示，ROCCET相比标准CUBIC减少延迟和缓冲膨胀，与BBRv3相比提供相似吞吐量但整体延迟更低。

Conclusion: TCP ROCCET能在不依赖特定网络架构的情况下，有效改善蜂窝网络中的拥塞控制性能，在各种条件下提供更好的网络拥塞响应。

Abstract: The behavior of loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms like TCP CUBIC
continues to be a challenge in modern cellular networks. Due to the large RLC
layer buffers required to deal with short-term changes in channel capacity, the
behavior of both the Slow Start and congestion avoidance phases may be heavily
impacted by the lack of packet losses and the resulting bufferbloat. While
existing congestion control algorithms like TCP BBR do tend to perform better
even in the presence of large bottleneck buffers, they still tend to fill the
buffer more than necessary and can have fairness issues when compared to
loss-based algorithms.
  In this paper, we analyze the issues with the use of loss-based congestion
control algorithms by analyzing TCP CUBIC, which is currently the most popular
variant. To mitigate the issues experienced by TCP CUBIC in cellular networks,
we introduce TCP ROCCET, a latency-based extension of TCP CUBIC that responds
to network congestion based on round-trip time in addition to packet loss.
  Our findings show that TCP ROCCET can reduce latency and bufferbloat compared
to the standard CUBIC implementation, without requiring a specific network
architecture. Compared to TCP BBRv3, ROCCET offers similar throughput while
maintaining lower overall latency. The evaluation was conducted in real 5G
networks, including both stationary and mobile scenarios, confirming ROCCET's
improved response to network congestion under varying conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy implications of remote rendering for
Virtual Reality (VR) applications within a real 5G testbed. Remote rendering
enables lightweight devices to access high-performance graphical content by
offloading computationally intensive tasks to Cloud-native Network Functions
(CNFs) running on remote servers. However, this approach raises concerns
regarding energy consumption across the various network components involved,
including the remote computing node, the 5G Core, the Radio Access Network
(RAN), and the User Equipment (UE). This work proposes and evaluates two
complementary energy monitoring solutions, one hardware-based and one
software-based, to measure energy consumption at different system levels. A VR
remote renderer, deployed as CNF and leveraging the Media over QUIC (MoQ)
protocol, is used as test case for assessing its energy footprint under
different multimedia and network configurations. The results provide critical
insights into the trade-off between energy consumption and performance of a
real-world VR application running in a 5G environment.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文首次通过仿真评估了低地球轨道卫星网络中多种拥塞控制方案的性能，发现现有方案在应对频繁切换、RTT剧变和非拥塞性丢包等LEO特有挑战时存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星网络由于频繁切换、RTT快速变化和非拥塞性丢包等特性，给拥塞控制带来了独特挑战，需要系统评估现有方案在这些条件下的表现。

Method: 使用LeoEM框架结合Mininet微基准测试，评估了三类代表性拥塞控制算法：基于丢包的(Cubic, SaTCP)、基于模型的(BBRv3)和基于学习的(Vivace, Sage, Astraea)，涵盖单流和多流场景以及与AQM的交互。

Result: 发现：(1)感知切换的基于丢包方案能恢复带宽但增加延迟；(2)BBRv3保持高吞吐量但RTT变化响应慢；(3)RL方案在动态条件下表现差但对非拥塞性丢包有抵抗力；(4)RTT不对称和多瓶颈时公平性显著下降；(5)AQM能恢复公平性和提升效率。

Conclusion: 当前拥塞控制方案在LEO网络中存在关键局限性，这些结果为设计LEO专用数据传输协议提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks introduce unique congestion control
(CC) challenges due to frequent handovers, rapidly changing round-trip times
(RTTs), and non-congestive loss. This paper presents the first comprehensive,
emulation-driven evaluation of CC schemes in LEO networks, combining realistic
orbital dynamics via the LeoEM framework with targeted Mininet
micro-benchmarks. We evaluated representative CC algorithms from three classes,
loss-based (Cubic, SaTCP), model-based (BBRv3), and learning-based (Vivace,
Sage, Astraea), across diverse single-flow and multi-flow scenarios, including
interactions with active queue management (AQM). Our findings reveal that: (1)
handover-aware loss-based schemes can reclaim bandwidth but at the cost of
increased latency; (2) BBRv3 sustains high throughput with modest delay
penalties, yet reacts slowly to abrupt RTT changes; (3) RL-based schemes
severely underperform under dynamic conditions, despite being notably resistant
to non-congestive loss; (4) fairness degrades significantly with RTT asymmetry
and multiple bottlenecks, especially in human-designed CC schemes; and (5) AQM
at bottlenecks can restore fairness and boost efficiency. These results expose
critical limitations in current CC schemes and provide insight for designing
LEO-specific data transport protocols.

Motivation: 传统蜂窝系统中设备必须通过基站通信，而用户对多媒体数据交换、快速服务、高质量语音通话等需求不断增加，需要提高网络容量。有限的频谱资源需要灵活使用来应对日益增长的需求。

Abstract: In the conventional cellular system, devices are not allowed to communicate
directly with each other in the licensed cellular bandwidth and all
communications take place through the base stations. The users requirements has
led the technology to become fast and faster. Multimedia rich data exchange,
fast service, high quality voice calls, newer and more demanding applications,
information at fingertips, everything requires technology and communication
between devices. A constant need to increase network capacity for meeting the
users growing demands has led to the growth of cellular communication networks
from the first generation(1G) to the fifth generation(5G). There will be crores
of connected devices in the coming future . A large number of connections are
going to be heterogeneous, demanding lesser delays, higher data rates, superior
throughput and enhanced system capacity. The available spectrum resources are
limited and has to be flexibly used by mobile network operators to cope with
the rising demands. An emerging facilitator of the upcoming high data rate
demanding next-generation networks are device-to-device(D2D) communication.
This paper has developed a model that establishes Device-to-Device (D2D)
communication between two end-users without involving the eNB (evolved Node B).
We have sharded the UEs and CUs based on the criteria of DISTANCE. To do so, we
used the K-means clustering method.

Abstract: Reliable downlink communication in satellite-to-underground networks remains
challenging due to severe signal attenuation caused by underground soil and
refraction in the air-soil interface. To address this, we propose a novel
cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an
aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices
(UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization
problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time
slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve
this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a
deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling
and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic
underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional
benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.

Abstract: As augmented and virtual reality evolve, achieving seamless synchronization
between physical and digital realms remains a critical challenge, especially
for real-time applications where delays affect the user experience. This paper
presents MetaLore, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for
joint communication and computational resource allocation in Metaverse or
digital twin environments. MetaLore dynamically shares the communication
bandwidth and computational resources among sensors and mobile devices to
optimize synchronization, while offering high throughput performance. Special
treatment is given in satisfying end-to-end delay guarantees. A key
contribution is the introduction of two novel Age of Information (AoI) metrics:
Age of Request Information (AoRI) and Age of Sensor Information (AoSI),
integrated into the reward function to enhance synchronization quality. An open
source simulator has been extended to incorporate and evaluate the approach.
The DRL solution is shown to achieve the performance of full-enumeration
brute-force solutions by making use of a small, task-oriented observation space
of two queue lengths at the network side. This allows the DRL approach the
flexibility to effectively and autonomously adapt to dynamic traffic
conditions.
