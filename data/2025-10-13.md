### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是如何通过少量数据微调来充分发挥其能力，解决传统方法需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少于1000张图像数据上的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配或超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM方法在目标检测任务中展现出卓越的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境中的多模态应用提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对脑肿瘤MRI分割中U-Net模型使用focal loss和数据增强策略的可重复性评估，达到90%精度，提供公开代码和结果作为研究基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展，需要建立可重复的基准研究。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上评估U-Net分割性能，使用focal loss并调参，结合三种数据增强技术：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Result: 使用focal loss的U-Net达到90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当，数据增强策略有效提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了透明、可重复的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，既能降低记忆化又能保持图像与文本的对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致图像与提示词对齐不佳。

Method: 发现初始噪声样本对逃逸吸引盆地的时间有重要影响，提出两种策略：集体调整和个体调整初始噪声，以找到能促进早期逃逸的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像与文本的良好对齐。

Conclusion: 通过精心选择初始噪声样本，可以在不牺牲图像质量的情况下有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化的创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题，特别是在职业场景中的性别偏见。

Method: 生成了750多张AI职业图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram工具，通过主题分析评估性别偏见。

Result: 两种AI图像生成工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。

Conclusion: AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘代表性的风险，需要采取措施确保生成图像中的多样性表现。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态混合专家路由机制，通过尺度感知阈值策略减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在不同分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要优化计算效率。

Method: 集成动态混合专家路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略，根据token复杂度和分辨率平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 提出的动态混合专家路由方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了未知物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法通常依赖预测熵，但这种方法混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD对象。需要一种能更好分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比基于预测熵的方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 基于层次贝叶斯建模的认知不确定性提取方法能有效提升无监督OOD检测性能，优于现有的不确定性基准方法。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，还允许将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在已标注传感器数据集训练范围与实际生活中活动范围之间的巨大差距，未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性，且活动类别之间存在不同程度的相似性和层次关系。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，支持开放集分类并允许未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行19种不同情境活动的数据，该数据集完全公开可供下载。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还提供了超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察力，为开放集人类活动识别研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类和S变换的高频振荡自动检测方法，在癫痫患者中验证了HFOs作为癫痫发生区生物标志物的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫发生区的新生物标志物，但手动检测耗时费力且主观性强，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分高频振荡、尖波、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在受控数据集中达到97.67%灵敏度、98.57%精确度和97.78% F分数；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率达到0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，发现其概念表示超越了简单的线性稀疏性，提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2视觉模型如何感知和表示视觉概念，探索其内部表示的本质特征。

Method: 采用线性表示假说和稀疏自编码器构建32,000个单元的字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究概念几何结构和统计特性。

Result: 发现功能专业化现象：分类使用"Elsewhere"概念实现否定逻辑，分割依赖边界检测器，深度估计利用单目深度线索。概念表示部分稠密而非严格稀疏，具有局部连接的低维结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说，认为token是通过凸混合原型组合形成的，这种结构基于概念空间理论，为理解视觉变换器表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法解决遥感图像多退化问题，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转为显式决策信号，实现多种异构退化的精确识别和差异化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化恢复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理复杂异构的退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含渐进式退化挖掘和利用机制，使用残差流形投影器和频率感知退化分解器分析退化特征，结合物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在所有四个恢复任务中均取得优越性能，显著优于现有最优方法，同时大幅减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，显著提升了恢复质量，同时获得了显著的效率增益。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，集成了语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法，能够从任意视角理解和创建场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。本文旨在开发一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，弥合相机与视觉语言之间的模态差距。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，使用Puffin-4M数据集（400万视觉-语言-相机三元组）进行训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，实现灵活可靠的空间生成。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解方面优于专用模型，通过指令调优可泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一相机中心的多模态方法，显著推进了空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集管道和基准测试以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医疗图像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，且在小数据下仍可能过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少额外参数使模型适应特定数据。

Result: 在三个少样本医疗图像分类任务上评估，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络相比现有基准取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供广泛适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Result: 评估20个代表性MLLM发现其在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限。BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 改善MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为全面评估MLLM具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种受生物视觉机制启发的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳采样和皮层填充机制，在不需重新训练分类器的情况下有效缓解对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过生物机制天生具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性，作者假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕捉多个中央-外周瞥视，整合成重建图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提高系统对各种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的关键挑战，实现了SOTA感知质量和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，计算成本高。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但历史上存在训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决问题。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用SNR-based Mixture of Experts架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 建立轻量级TAG引导范式，基于"精度优于数量"原则。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了SOTA感知质量和卓越效率，核心扩散前向传递达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作为在逼真超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于计算机视觉的无监督关键帧提取方法，用于新西兰濒危鹦鹉kākā的个体识别和重识别，替代传统的物理标记方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式的高效自动化识别方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: 这种基于AI和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-Router，一个基于多层级模型路由系统的智能视频质量评估框架，通过视觉语言模型动态选择专家模型，解决现有VQA模型的泛化性、可解释性和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在三个主要问题：(1)在不同内容和任务间泛化能力差，包括用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容；(2)可解释性有限；(3)缺乏对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性。

Method: Q-Router采用智能框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并组合最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重的层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在基于质量的问题回答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，并具有作为视频生成模型后训练奖励函数的潜力。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法缺乏统一的模态对齐方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且知识融合可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 使用对比学习和最优传输理论实现多层次模态对齐；2) 软标签硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇表作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的模态对齐、有效的硬负样本处理和选择性知识融合，显著提升了Med-VQA性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在视频生成和修复中很关键，但计算成本高且速度慢，限制了其在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益很少，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准SR基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟加速，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过简单而有效的策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少了视频超分辨率的计算量，为高分辨率和长视频处理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解来解决图像预训练视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域时的感知瓶颈和token过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，这超出了图像模型的能力范围。论文识别了感知瓶颈和token过载这两个关键问题。

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含两个核心组件：1）动态压缩 - 自适应选择代表性帧并进行内容感知的空间token聚合，减少冗余同时保留信息内容；2）问题分解 - 将原始查询重新表述为子问题，引导模型关注视频的不同方面。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色，显示出处理复杂视频-语言任务的潜力。

Conclusion: D-CoDe通过动态压缩和问题分解成功解决了视频大语言模型中的感知瓶颈和token过载问题，为图像预训练模型向视频领域的扩展提供了有效的训练免费适配方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D映射带来的噪声和计算开销，在ScanNet200数据集上达到35.7 AP50，推理速度提升6.0-152.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D RGB-D图像，然后使用视觉语言模型分类，但这种方法会引入2D遮挡噪声，且推理时计算和内存成本高，速度慢。

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中。教师模型生成包含可见性和视角多样性的2D CLIP嵌入，学生模型直接生成3D实例嵌入。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica数据集上实验，ScanNet200数据集AP50达到35.7，相比之前方法推理速度提升6.0-152.2倍。

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏避免了2D映射的噪声问题，显著加速了推理过程，在开放词汇3D实例分割任务上取得了最先进的性能和效率。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蔓越莓生长监测通常需要人工完成，耗时耗力。深度学习虽有望解决此问题，但面临高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的挑战。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器(ViTs)，通过时间回归和类别预测的双重预训练任务学习植物和果实外观的时间演化潜在空间。

Result: 生成的2D时间轨迹提供了可解释的作物生长时间序列模型，能够预测生长趋势并区分不同蔓越莓品种的时间差异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和场景，同时提供了一个包含8个品种、52次观测的新时间序列蔓越莓数据集。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量的方法，同时捕捉概念家族内的层次结构和跨概念家族的组合性，在多项任务上优于现有单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构（如狗⊑哺乳动物⊑动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"汽车里的狗"⊑狗,汽车）。虽然双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表示能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲空间的笛卡尔积上采用ℓ₁-乘积度量，让家族内层次结构出现在单个双曲因子中，而跨家族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP成功解决了同时表示层次结构和组合性的挑战，通过双曲空间笛卡尔积和ℓ₁-乘积度量的设计，在多个任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一个新的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种分割模型和三种骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息重映射有效提升了对抗样本的跨模型迁移能力，且不引入额外计算开销，在迁移攻击成功率和计算效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度学习模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以扩展到图像恢复任务，因为图像恢复是生成任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保持，微小扰动效果有限。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值以注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系，同时保持教师模型输出质量。

Result: 在超分辨率、低光增强、水下增强、去雾和去雨五个图像恢复任务中，ASVP将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新视频MLLM模型。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，但通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，证明了其在提升模型鲁棒性方面的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 解决农业监测系统中无人机动物健康监测面临的数据稀缺问题，特别是针对特定农场条件下动物品种、环境和行为的多样性不足。

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术生成真实多样的场景。

Result: 初步实验显示增强数据集在动物检测任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，在数据稀缺场景下实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过鼓励丰富的感知标记和分解复杂感知问题，显著提升大型视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于推理时间扩展的方法在提升LVLMs推理能力方面取得成功，但对视觉感知的影响尚不明确。研究发现LVLMs在视觉估计任务中精度有限，推理时间扩展仅带来边际收益。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励丰富的感知标记生成，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS将DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在域外任务上泛化良好。即使使用纯合成数据，与数学推理数据结合也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: PTS通过增加感知相关标记和提升模型对图像标记的关注，有效解决了当前LVLMs快速感知范式的局限性，使感知能够与推理时间扩展对齐并从中受益。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射常导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，这种对先验的过度依赖会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出增强额外的关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下的115,000多个信号帧评估中，mmJoints描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模姿态估计中的偏差，不仅提高了可解释性，还显著提升了关节位置精度和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了HiMIR框架，通过分层检索和冗余优化，在提升多模态检索准确性的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法准确性有限，现有的多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度图像片段冗余方面存在不足。

Method: 采用分层检索范式，使用多个中间粒度处理不同图像对象以增强对齐；利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算；自动配置数据集参数。

Result: 在保持显著准确性提升的同时，计算量比现有MVR系统减少高达3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，适用于多样化的实际场景。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

*Zichuan Wang,Bo Peng,Songlin Yang,Zhenchen Tang,Jing Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集和结合手部关键点先验知识的多模态大语言模型，显著提升了生成手部图像的质量评估准确性，并在下游应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）生成准确细节方面仍存在困难，生成的手部经常出现结构扭曲和不真实纹理，但手部区域质量评估研究却被忽视，限制了人本生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 首先构建HandPair数据集（包含48k张高质量和低质量手部图像对），然后开发HandEval模型，该模型利用多模态大语言模型的强大视觉理解能力，并融入手部关键点先验知识，从而获得对手部质量的强感知能力。

Result: 在从各种最先进T2I模型收集的手部图像构建的人工标注测试集上验证，HandEval比现有最先进方法更好地与人类判断对齐。将其集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中，分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确性。

Conclusion: HandEval作为首个专门针对生成手部区域的质量评估模型，在评估准确性和下游应用效果方面都表现出色，证实了其在各种下游应用中的普遍有效性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI上色技术存在版权侵权风险（如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影上色并转售），目前缺乏有效的防御方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换以增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低上色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI上色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传递来生成单张图像，效率低下。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并通过低成本微调预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归文本到图像模型推理效率低的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出一种简单有效的策略：1）使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉token；2）在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中屏蔽这些不确定token

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和抑制不确定视觉token，可以有效缓解物体幻觉问题，且该方法简单高效

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略在自回归图像生成中具有通用性，能同时改善生成质量和加速采样过程。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在领域偏移下会进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，强制特征级一致性，并基于置信度感知过滤的预测应用交叉熵损失。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，整体算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为LiDAR语义分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Conclusion: 通过多模态知识嵌入和正则化对齐，可以在不依赖测试时多模态输入的情况下，显著提升单模态网络的动态手势识别性能。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的基于视觉Transformer的图像异常检测框架能够有效监控柔性微电极植入过程，确保植入的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Conclusion: 提出的深度稀疏表示分类网络能够有效学习鲁棒特征和稀疏表示，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状理解，对局部几何细节建模探索不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并设计补丁级状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过增强局部几何上下文学习和细粒度几何理解，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小目标和频繁遮挡等问题挑战现有方法的检测精度和轨迹连续性。

Method: 采用GL-DT框架，包含时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协同检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法解决ID切换和轨迹碎片化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持了实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型参数规模大导致推理开销大，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，提出混合块选择性激活DiT块，设计多步蒸馏流程包括泰勒度量专家初始化、负载均衡知识蒸馏和组特征损失优化。

Result: 将FLUX.1等大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，FFN中激活参数减少62.5%，整体激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能并超越剪枝方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: SOS是一个基于物体中心组合策略的简单可扩展数据合成管道，通过将高质量合成物体片段粘贴到新图像中，生成准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式，在检测和定位任务上超越大型真实图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型标注数据集成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展，合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性，需要一种可控的数据集构建方法来改善泛化能力。

Method: 使用物体中心组合策略，通过结构化布局先验和生成式重光照将高质量合成物体片段粘贴到新图像中，生成准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于在GRIT（2000万）和V3Det（20万）等更大真实图像数据集上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力，增强LVIS和COCO可带来跨真实数据规模的强大性能，在极有限真实数据下获得更大增益。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)生成细胞和细胞核分割的真实图像-掩码对，通过整合形态学、颜色特征和元数据来解决标注数据稀缺问题，显著提升分割模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过细胞/细胞核形态学(水平和垂直图)、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指征元数据来条件化生成过程，通过多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像和真实图像的嵌入之间具有低Wasserstein距离。加入合成样本(如柱状细胞)显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性的问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角度处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角度基，实现完全核分解，使径向和角度处理独立，从而构建可分离的正交变换。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降低到O(N² log N)，内存需求降低到O(N²)，条件数缩放降低到O(√N)，在数值稳定性、计算效率和分类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架实现了传统方法无法实现的高阶矩分析，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法通常单独分析输入特征或训练样本影响，需要将两者结合研究以更好理解深度模型内部机制。

Method: 开发训练特征归因方法，通过关联测试预测与训练图像特定区域，揭示模型决策过程。

Result: 在视觉数据集实验中，该方法能识别导致错误分类的有害样本，发现传统方法无法暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因提供细粒度、测试特定的解释，能更深入理解深度神经网络的工作机制。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Motivation: 传统支气管镜导航方法依赖术前CT扫描和额外传感器，成本高且操作复杂。拓扑定位通常足以辅助外科医生导航，无需精确的度量定位

Method: 开发基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用幻影数据进行训练，无需真实患者数据标注，避免了高昂的数据标注成本

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列上表现优异，超越了现有方法，特别是在真实数据上

Conclusion: 该图像支气管镜拓扑定位方法无需患者CT扫描，仅用幻影数据训练即可提供有效的导航辅助，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，但细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了ILR在实际应用中的跨领域适用性。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，形成大规模训练集，不依赖任何真实图像。

Result: 在基础视觉模型上使用生成数据进行微调，在七个跨领域ILR基准测试中显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR提供了高效有效的替代方案，无需大量数据收集和整理，仅需目标领域名称即可，开启了ILR的新范式。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将它们分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法仅标记为'Unknown'更有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，遇到未知物体时存在风险。传统开放集检测方法将所有未知物体标记为单一'Unknown'类别不够实用，在自动驾驶等安全关键场景中，为未知物体分配更具描述性的子类别能显著提升决策质量。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的head建模物体性，层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督，分类模块学习层次关系。通过语义层次结构将未知物体分类到粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了传统开放集检测的局限性，通过层次化分类为未知物体提供更有意义的语义信息，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合部署在低功耗硬件上，代码和编译脚本将开源。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对板球击球动作分类进行了首个全面基准研究，比较了7种深度学习方法在4个研究范式下的表现，发现学术文献中的高精度声明与实际实现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 板球击球动作分类在体育视频分析中仍具挑战性，需要有效建模时空特征。现有文献中的高精度声明缺乏标准化评估，需要系统性的基准研究来验证实际性能。

Method: 实现并系统评估了7种深度学习方法：传统CNN-LSTM、注意力模型、视觉变换器、迁移学习方法以及现代EfficientNet-GRU组合，使用统一的基准和现代MLOps实践。

Result: 重新实现先前文献的方法发现性能显著下降（46.0%、55.6%、57.7% vs 原报告的96%、99.2%、93%），而现代SOTA方法（EfficientNet-B0 + GRU）达到92.25%准确率。

Conclusion: 现代架构和系统优化能带来显著改进，标准化评估协议在体育视频分析研究中至关重要，现有文献中的性能声明需要谨慎对待。

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAAD-X数据集和VCBM框架，用于自动驾驶中的可解释驾驶员意图预测，通过多模态数据和概念瓶颈模型生成时空一致的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。深度学习系统缺乏对环境和驾驶任务底层表示的理解，这限制了人机交互的有效性。

Method: 构建DAAD-X多模态数据集，包含驾驶员眼动和车辆视角的层次化文本解释；提出VCBM框架，使用概念瓶颈模型生成时空一致的解释，无需后处理技术。

Result: 实验表明基于Transformer的模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性；提出的多标签t-SNE可视化技术能够展示多个解释之间的解缠和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架和DAAD-X数据集为可解释驾驶员意图预测提供了有效解决方案，Transformer架构在可解释性方面优于CNN，多标签可视化技术有助于理解解释间的因果关系。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在完全监督和少样本学习场景下均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康和生产力的重要指标，现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的识别框架。

Method: 基于CLIP大规模图像-语言模型，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门文本提示来弥合预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，Cattle-CLIP在监督设置下达到96.1%的总体准确率，对进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景下也表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高，特别是在长距离或复杂场景中，时间分辨测量的3D重建面临挑战。

Method: 设计了专门的时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器，通过多尺度特征处理来探索局部和全局相关性，并开发了TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个任务特定实现。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，两种实现都显著优于现有方法，并贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构为光子效率成像提供了有效的解决方案，通过专门的注意力机制提升了3D重建性能，并丰富了该领域的数据资源。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [59] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流媒体故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练与推理之间的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要通过手工设计的抗漂移技术来缓解累积错误，但仍局限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与自回归推理现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调，将扩散变换器(DiT)自生成的错误回收为监督提示，鼓励模型主动识别和纠正自身错误。具体包括：(i)注入历史错误干预干净输入；(ii)通过一步双向积分高效近似预测并计算残差误差；(iii)跨离散时间步动态存储错误到回放记忆中。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时保持与多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）的兼容性。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的累积错误问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面均表现出色，确立了该领域的领先地位。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐在电商平台中至关重要，需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式以提供个性化用户体验。

Method: 使用LLM基于商品标题和描述生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与商品ID、文本和视觉特征融合构建增强表示，采用标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统具有显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and

TL;DR: 提出了基于多模态大语言模型的肩部疾病诊断框架HMVDx，通过动作理解和疾病诊断的分工，在医疗资源匮乏地区实现低成本辅助诊断，诊断准确率比直接视频诊断提升79.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病如肩周炎等常见病的早期准确诊断面临挑战，急需低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出混合运动视频诊断框架HMVDx，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑流程的可用性指数新指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%，显著提升了MLLM在医疗视频理解中的应用效果。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的研究提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本研究建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，比较了开源视觉语言模型与专用模型在隐私预测方面的性能，发现尽管VLMs参数更多、推理更慢，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专用的小型模型，但VLMs对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用为通用任务设计的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽视了专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准进行公平比较，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，并与已有的视觉专用和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs尽管资源密集（参数多、推理慢），但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专用的小型模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专用模型，但其在鲁棒性方面的优势值得关注，为未来模型设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中容易产生幻觉的问题，研究者希望找到一种可靠的方法来识别和过滤可能产生错误回答的问题。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，在温度1.0下对每个问题回答15次，通过双向蕴含检查将意义等效的回答分组，计算语义簇的相对频率得到DSE值。然后排除DSE值高于阈值的问题重新计算准确率。

Result: 在706个图像-问题对中，基线准确率分别为51.7%(GPT-4o)和54.8%(GPT-4.1)。过滤掉高熵问题(DSE>0.3)后，剩余问题的准确率分别提升至76.3%(GPT-4o)和63.8%(GPT-4.1)，统计学显著。

Conclusion: DSE方法能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，通过量化语义不一致性显著提高了诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM方法采样策略要么依赖手工启发式规则忽略时序线索，要么使用外部关键帧模型增加系统复杂性，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: 1) 训练时使用专用[FIND]令牌进行时序令牌相似度匹配来识别关键时刻；2) 推理时采用时刻中心采样策略密集采样信息时刻；3) 开发双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Result: 该方法自然整合了关键时刻定位能力，避免了外部时间戳编码需求，同时保持了运动细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有效解决了RefVOS中的时序推理和细粒度视觉理解需求，通过联合优化TSG和RefVOS实现了更高效准确的分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅建立了分析多模态RLVR的token级感知视角，还提出了显著增强LVLM多模态推理能力的新型优化策略。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，通过大规模眼动实验发现视觉信息搜索具有最优效率，且CNN模型能够仅从图像输入预测注视热点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类视觉注视的时空统计特性，理解视觉探索的底层动态，这对注意力建模和视觉界面有广泛应用价值。

Method: 进行大规模人类被试实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点，分析注视轨迹统计特性，并训练CNN模型预测注视热点。

Result: 人类视觉注视轨迹确实遵循Levy行走模式，类似于动物觅食行为；CNN模型能够准确预测新图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建CapGeo-Bench数据集进行系统评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为标题是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过标题辅助推理桥接视觉和文本模态；创建CapGeo-Bench数据集（4,641个图形-标题对）和基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 配备标题后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。评估指标与下游性能强相关。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和基准测试为推进MLLMs的几何推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Result: 在保持重建精度的同时，参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 为未来6G网络的可扩展、高能效、实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提升自监督单目深度估计性能，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法因语义-空间知识提取不足而存在性能限制，需要更充分的上下文信息。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE流水线集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net网络，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制改进半监督细胞核实例分割，解决了现有方法在实例级一致性、病理结构先验利用和伪标签噪声方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺限制了全监督方法的应用，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化、病理结构先验知识利用和伪标签噪声控制方面存在不足。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用细胞核形态先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签并增强高质量预测。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升了半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越了全监督方法。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识引导的伪标签质量控制，有效提升了半监督细胞核实例分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于热红外图像增强的渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，通过建立基于热成像过程的提示对来调制模型特征，能够自适应处理单一或复合退化问题，并在复杂退化场景中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 提出渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合对应提示对调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练(SPT)机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Result: 该方法不仅能去除相机噪声、保留关键结构细节，还能增强热图像整体对比度，在复杂退化场景中实现了8.76%的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复合退化问题时具有明显优势，为热红外图像处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试因训练测试重叠而高估模型能力。需要开发更有效的多模态关键词预测方法。

Conclusion: 提出的动态CoT等策略能够有效提升视觉语言模型在多模态关键词预测任务中的表现，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，而非依赖外部知识，要求模型进行细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，往往将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，作者开发了一个基于挑战性感知任务的视觉中心推理基准。

Method: BLINK-Twice整合了三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型测试视觉推理、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程。评估了20个领先的MLLM，包括12个基础模型和8个推理增强模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战。现有的语言空间推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提升性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高模型性能，主动视觉交互（如o3模型）突显了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了开发专门针对视觉推理的新范式的必要性，现有模型在纯视觉推理任务上仍有显著改进空间，需要超越语言主导的推理方法。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市场景中由于观察视锥不重叠导致点覆盖不均匀和不完整，训练时会产生扭曲和伪影。现有密度化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 1) 基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2) 多样性感知视图选择选取信息丰富的支持视图；3) 基于块匹配的多视角立体重建恢复缺失结构；4) 在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导生成新的高斯基元，有效解决了3DGS在城市场景中几何恢复的挑战，即使在没有初始点的区域也能实现高质量重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确的森林生物量量化对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR擅长捕捉3D森林结构，但由于难以建模区分树木所需的长距离依赖关系，直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长距离依赖关系以改进树木区分。加入跳跃连接以增强特征并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清查。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在目标检测等任务中。分析DETR中MLP层的内在稀疏性，并开发利用这种稀疏性的方法，以提高推理效率。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法，预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR基础上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS方法实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持甚至提高性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: MGS提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得无需完全重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉transformer模型。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景进行基于文本的编辑在内容创作和虚拟环境中具有广泛应用价值，但面临在复杂动态场景中实现语义精确编辑同时保持未编辑内容完整性的挑战。

Method: 方法包括：1）用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；2）两阶段点级定位策略（CLIP相似度候选选择+空间范围精炼）；3）使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型进行针对性编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor为4D场景编辑提供了一个灵活准确的解决方案，成功解决了复杂动态场景中语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，相比现有最优方法提供更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过有效利用时间信息，在低光视频增强任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于森林环境下树木实例分割和物种分类，包含1476棵树、24个物种，在五个生物气候区域收集，基准测试显示树木分割相对容易但物种分类仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注城市环境或有限物种，无法满足复杂自然环境中林业机器人感知需求，如精确林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候区域收集林冠下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树、24个物种，构建SilvaScenes数据集，并基准测试现代深度学习实例分割方法。

Result: 树木分割表现良好（最高mAP 67.65%），但物种分类仍具挑战性（mAP仅35.69%），表明在复杂自然环境中物种识别是主要难点。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes填补了森林环境感知数据集的空白，为开发林业机器人感知系统提供了重要资源，同时揭示了物种分类在复杂自然环境中的挑战性。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at
https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes.

TL;DR: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布来缓解对比视觉语言模型中主导维度的影响，改善测试时提示调优的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差。

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，从而减轻对主导维度的依赖。

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，提高了视觉语言模型在真实部署场景中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化为对比视觉语言模型提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，通过减轻主导维度依赖来增强模型校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画、游戏等领域中，从少量人类设计的参考角色生成无限新角色，同时保持艺术风格和视觉特征的挑战。

Method: 基于DreamBooth微调技术，提出多令牌策略（使用聚类为单个角色和集体风格分配独立令牌），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机令牌和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上评估，定量指标和人工评估均表明该方法能生成高质量、多样化角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了从少量参考生成无限新角色的问题，在保持艺术风格的同时扩展了创意可能性，人工评估进一步证实了其有效性。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 交互式分割是构建稳健、可泛化医学图像分割算法的有前景策略，但不一致和不现实的评估阻碍了公平比较并歪曲了真实性能。

Method: 提出了临床基础的方法论来定义评估任务和指标，并构建了软件框架用于构建标准化评估流程。

Result: 评估发现：(i)最小化用户交互处理中的信息损失对模型稳健性至关重要；(ii)自适应缩放机制提升稳健性和收敛速度；(iii)验证提示行为/预算与训练不同时性能下降；(iv)2D方法在板状图像和粗糙目标上表现良好，但3D上下文有助于处理大或不规则形状目标；(v)非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要标准化评估框架来公平比较交互式分割算法，临床现实的评估对于准确反映真实世界性能至关重要。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准，包含三个难度级别：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造，通过1000多个图像-文本对进行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代MLLMs在具身AI中利用其广泛常识进行高级规划，但它们对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估32个MLLMs在三个难度级别上的表现：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造。

Result: 对32个MLLMs的全面评估显示，在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，包括专有、开源、专用具身和VLA骨干模型。

Conclusion: 提出了初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开，为改进MLLMs的物理工具理解能力提供了基准和分析。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: 三星智能手机存在对角线伪影问题，影响PRNU相机源验证。某些Galaxy S和A系列机型存在指纹碰撞问题。支持PRO模式和RAW拍摄的设备仍可进行可靠验证，但中端A系列无法使用此方法。对角线伪影在法证应用中也有潜在用途。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三星智能手机对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，解决指纹碰撞问题，探索法证应用可能性。

Method: 分析三星Galaxy S和A系列机型图像中的对角线伪影模式，比较RAW图像和普通图像的差异，研究PRO模式的作用。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列机型存在共同模式导致指纹碰撞，A系列也有类似问题。支持RAW拍摄的设备可绕过伪影问题，但中端A系列无法使用此方法。对角线伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影影响PRNU验证，但支持RAW拍摄的设备仍可可靠验证。伪影在法证应用中具有潜在价值，特别是在处理HDR和人像模式图像时。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标表示，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含渐进细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间语义对齐，以及增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化的重排和卷积在下采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功解决了航拍图像小目标检测中的信息退化问题，在实时性和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行变形时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造，将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保变换的连续性和可逆性。

Result: 在面部变形、图像变形和高斯溅射变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的变形方法提供了原则性和稳定的变换，能够实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA提出了一种动态参数化控制方法，通过超网络为每个扩散步骤生成LoRA适配器，实现条件引导的时变调节，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成质量和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件引导，这种固定策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态特性，限制了模型在生成过程中从粗结构到精细细节的适应能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络根据时间和用户条件动态生成LoRA适配器，直接调节冻结骨干网络的权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过权重的深度功能适配来修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于先前的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在低样本和开放集场景中。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，为生物医学检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Motivation: 量化计算机视觉和机器学习领域的研究趋势变化，特别是多模态视觉语言模型、生成方法和3D/视频理解的发展动态，为学术界提供宏观视角。

Method: 对论文标题和摘要进行标准化处理，使用手工构建的词典匹配方法，为每篇论文分配最多35个主题标签，挖掘任务、架构、训练机制、目标函数、数据集和多模态线索等细粒度信息。

Result: 发现三大宏观转变：1）多模态视觉语言LLM研究急剧增长，将传统感知重新定义为指令跟随和多步推理；2）生成方法稳步扩展，扩散研究集中在可控性、蒸馏和速度；3）3D和视频研究保持活跃，从NeRF转向高斯泼溅，更关注人本和智能体理解。

Conclusion: 多模态视觉语言模型已成为主导趋势，参数高效适应方法流行，训练实践从零构建编码器转向指令调优和微调强骨干网络。不同会议各有侧重，CVPR在3D领域更强，ICLR在VLM方面份额最高。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效使视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时理解无限视频流设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练-推理对齐框架，使用KV缓存重用和注意力机制，在长视频处理中实现低延迟和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的训练-推理对齐框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存，重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token和文本token。通过简单的监督微调策略，在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能。SFT策略还提升了通用VQA能力，在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升+4.30和+5.96。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频处理的延迟和内存问题，实现了实时稳定的无限视频流理解，同时提升了通用视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学物）难以区分的问题，提升模型在实际应用中的准确性。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理在开发集上显著提升性能（微F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上表现不佳（微F1从0.79降至0.77），表明存在过拟合开发数据的问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化方法对预训练BioNER模型具有潜力，但必须解决过拟合开发数据的问题，确保模型在真实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时缩放(TTS)方法存在一个未被认识到的失败模式：当候选回答多样性受限时，TTS更可能产生不安全输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中关于候选回答多样性的假设存在安全漏洞，当多样性受限时会导致安全风险增加。

Method: 提出RefDiv参考引导多样性减少协议作为诊断攻击，通过约束候选回答多样性来测试TTS管道的安全性。

Result: 在四个开源模型和两种TTS策略中，限制多样性显著增加了不安全输出的产生率，且现有安全防护措施无法有效检测这种攻击。

Conclusion: TTS方法存在普遍的安全漏洞，需要设计更鲁棒的策略来抵御针对多样性的攻击。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC模型，通过多任务学习和跨层注意力机制整合多层自监督学习特征，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，在语音抑郁检测中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法通常只使用SSL模型的最终层或寻找单一最佳层，容易过拟合且无法充分利用层次结构来检测细微持久的抑郁信号。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含层次自适应聚类模块重组SSL特征为互补嵌入，以及跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系，结合CTC损失进行对齐感知训练。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的macro F1分数，在标准数据划分和交叉验证两种设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层SSL特征和CTC时序建模，显著提升了语音抑郁检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对数学的真正理解程度，超越传统基准测试，诊断具体失败点。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5生成结构化推理步骤，然后用GPT-4o-mini进行错误分类和无监督聚类，识别不同的推理模式。

Result: 发现模型表现出非人类化的脆弱性：在顺序计算等程序性模式上近乎完美，但在需要组合推理的模式上表现急剧下降。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更细粒度的数学理解评估方法，为开发新能力和更可靠的应用提供了精确路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无参考指标（如自困惑度）对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布中推导出置信度分数(CS)，在99个创意提示上测试其表现。

Result: 基于流畅度的指标在0%的情况下偏好新颖回答，而CS在19%的情况下偏好新颖回答，差异具有统计显著性。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: 置信度分数减轻了传统指标对创意的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供了更平衡的评估方法。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的性能恢复研究主要关注鲁棒量化技术，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的来源（如不当模型序列化）中恢复模型精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA能够恢复5-17%的模型精度。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA是一种有效的轻量级方法，能够从各种模型优化导致的性能退化中恢复模型精度。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一种受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的LLM设计，使用图结构存储和概率召回机制，在医疗对话场景中显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法在资源受限的边缘设备上有效处理长期记忆需求，特别是在医疗等需要处理时间序列相似对话的场景中。

Method: 采用图结构存储、模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和剪枝机制，以及基于人类记忆模型的概率召回（包含时间衰减和刷新过程），并引入从固定长度记忆图子集高效推导的"核心摘要"来捕获用户个性等长期细节。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的最高胜率（基线RAG为31.1%），在LoCoMo基准测试中在时间推理和单跳检索方面达到当前最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI等常用基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以实现改进的事实召回、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应，为纵向医疗助手等应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

Motivation: 现有方法将AI文本检测视为二分类问题，但人类文本并不构成统一分布，这种二元化方法导致模型记忆观察到的OOD特征而非学习'非ID'行为的本质，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD和HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（如基于能量的方法），构建离群检测框架来处理检测任务。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、受攻击、未见模型和领域文本设置下均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为OOD检测问题能显著提升检测器的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

Motivation: 解决LLM在病理学等高门槛领域的幻觉问题，传统领域微调方法无法扩展知识边界或强制执行证据约束。

Method: 构建包含28个子领域153万段落的病理学向量数据库，采用双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块。

Result: 在YpathR基准上Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M基准上，通用和医学LLM准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: YpathRAG显著提高了检索质量和事实可靠性，为病理学导向的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction

Motivation: 现有越狱攻击使用高困惑度的对抗后缀或长提示模板来解锁模型响应，但容易被基于困惑度的过滤检测到。

Method: 通过最小化对抗提示与无害请求在潜在空间中表示的距离，选择语义等效的词语替换输入提示中的词语，生成自然且低困惑度的对抗提示。

Result: LatentBreak生成的提示更短且困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上优于其他越狱算法对抗基于困惑度的过滤器。

Conclusion: LatentBreak提供了一种有效的方法来生成低困惑度的对抗提示，能够规避基于困惑度的防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Method: 检测文本、音频和视频中的每句话热点，通过热点门控融合与全局特征结合，使用路由混合对齐器对齐模态，并通过跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中相比强基线获得一致提升，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的贡献。

Conclusion: 提出了以热点为中心的视角，可为未来多模态学习提供信息，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估大语言模型在亚洲语境下文化意识的框架，包含多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集和五维评估协议，旨在测试模型的文化认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在非西方高资源环境下的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的表现。

Method: 构建包含8个亚洲国家、10种语言的27,000个多选题基准数据集，采用五维评估协议（文化意识差异、跨语言一致性、跨模态一致性、文化知识泛化、基础有效性），并开发文化意识基础验证模块检测捷径学习。

Result: 数据集79%的问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理，首次实现了文本、图像和语音三种模态在输入层面的对齐，支持跨模态迁移的直接测试。

Conclusion: 通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和创新的视觉消融前缀回放方法，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间的差异，为构建文化可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一框架，将神经元激活及其信号传播表示为图，解释LLMs如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用基于图的视角，使用PageRank等图算法来表征LLMs的特性，识别GraphGhost中的激活神经元，并通过结构干预进行评估。

Result: 揭示了跨不同数据集的共享和模型特定的推理行为，对关键神经元节点的编辑会触发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预并最终理解LLMs推理结构基础的强大工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中虽然诊断结果相对一致，但在判断患者性别相关性和必要性时存在显著不一致性，特别是对女性-男性性别差异的系统性偏见，这会影响LLM在临床实践中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用前景广阔，但其对偏见的敏感性是一个关键问题。性别长期以来影响着医生行为和患者结果，因此需要研究LLM在扮演人类角色时是否会复制或放大与性别相关的偏见。

Method: 使用《新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛》的案例研究，为多个开源和专有LLM分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估它们在LLM性别分配下的响应一致性，包括基于LLM的诊断以及模型对患者性别临床相关性或必要性的判断。

Result: 对于大多数模型，不同LLM性别分配下的诊断结果相对一致。但在判断患者性别相关性和必要性方面，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是在相关性判断方面。一些模型甚至在对患者性别的解释中显示出系统性的女性-男性差异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了一种未被充分探索的偏见，可能会削弱LLM在临床实践中的可靠性，强调在与人机交互时需要常规检查身份分配一致性，以确保可靠和公平的AI支持临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用LLMs自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，解决了现有干扰条件数据集质量低、难以检测的问题，同时保持原始问题解法不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，缺少有意义的干扰条件。当引入干扰条件时，主流LLMs性能显著下降，但现有干扰条件数据集难度低、表达不自然，降低了基准测试的可信度。

Method: 设计迭代框架，利用LLMs从多个视角和认知层次修订数学应用题，自动生成有意义的干扰条件。关键优势是保持原始问题与修订问题解法一致，无需生成新答案。

Result: 该框架高效易部署，大幅减少了生成含干扰条件数学应用题的工作量，同时保持高质量数据。

Conclusion: 提出的自动生成干扰条件框架解决了现有数据集的局限性，为评估LLMs在复杂数学推理场景下的表现提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过重新评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现来探测LLM泛化能力的简单协议，发现改写会导致显著的准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试分数可能因记忆测试项目或近似重复项而虚高，需要评估模型是否真正理解问题而非依赖表面形式捷径。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上测量原始问题和改写问题之间的准确率差距，包含解码控制、多选题输出格式强制和语义保持的改写清理步骤。

Result: 改写会导致非平凡的准确率下降（原始vs改写），这与之前关于污染和脆弱的表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能存在污染问题，模型可能过度依赖表面形式而非真正理解语义，需要更严格的评估方法来测试泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从较小的英语模型开始，通过扩展参数空间来系统整合泰语知识，避免了传统方法中知识侵蚀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖现有开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法会侵蚀模型参数空间中已有的知识。需要一种既能保持原有通用智能又能有效整合泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从较小的高性能英语开源LLM开始，扩展其参数空间，利用新分配的能力系统整合泰语知识。预训练接触1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），随后进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）上表现优于Typhoon2-70B模型。

Conclusion: 上扩增和知识整合框架有效，既能保持原有通用智能，又能建立独特的架构，支持未来的可扩展增强。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于职业条件的轻量级策略，使销售导向的对话代理能根据用户职业调整对话意图，实现更短更成功的对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟研究来优化对话策略。研究旨在探索基于用户画像（年龄、性别、职业）的销售对话代理适应性。

Method: 分析了年龄、性别和职业对对话意图的影响，发现职业差异最显著。据此开发了轻量级的职业条件策略，指导代理优先选择符合用户偏好的对话意图。

Result: 职业对对话意图影响最大，基于职业的策略能显著缩短对话长度并提高成功率。年龄和性别主要影响整体性能。

Conclusion: 丰富的模拟用户画像很重要，简单的基于人物特征的策略能有效提升销售导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: Text2Stories提出了一种评估软件需求与用户访谈内容对齐度的任务和指标，包括正确性和完整性两个维度，通过文本块与用户故事的匹配来量化需求是否真实反映用户需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以自动从访谈记录生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否准确反映用户需求仍然主要依赖人工，需要自动化的评估方法。

Method: 将访谈记录分割成文本块，将用户故事与文本块的匹配建模为匹配问题，使用LLM和嵌入模型进行匹配，计算正确性（故事被访谈支持的比例）和完整性（访谈内容被故事覆盖的比例）。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，嵌入模型虽然性能稍差但能有效进行阻塞匹配。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成vs自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、忠实于源头的补充评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升非结构化文本的结构化信息提取性能，减少幻觉错误并保持向后兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将LLM应用于JSON模式提取任务，但将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、频繁出现幻觉，以及在模式规范模糊或不完整时代理行为不可靠。

Method: 开发PARSE系统，包含ARCHITECT（自动优化JSON模式）和SCOPE（基于反射的提取方法）两个协同组件，通过RELAY代码生成系统保持向后兼容性。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，PARSE在SWDE上提取准确率提升64.7%，整体框架改进达10%，首次重试时提取错误减少92%，同时保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为可解释和改进的自然语言理解合约，显著提高了结构化信息提取的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示会夸大LLM性能，导致更长的推理链但准确性提升有限，建议采用中性措辞和双框架检查来确保基准测试反映真实部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查评估导向提示是否夸大LLM性能而不带来相应的能力提升，因为真实部署需要简洁、合同约束的回答而非冗长的推理过程。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型，在六个配对A/B场景中固定任务内容和解码，仅改变框架（评估导向vs真实世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确性、合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理链长度（数百到1000+字符），降低仅回答合规性，准确性提升有限或不一致。激励措辞会重新分配错误组成，多语言标题会重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双框架检查、合同感知评分等方法来确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力，避免评估气味带来的性能膨胀。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: PULSE框架利用SLM生成的推理文本作为主要学习信号，结合交互历史共同建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素，在推荐系统中实现了比传统ID、协同过滤和LLM方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐系统中推理能力强但推理成本高，而SLMs效率高但推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理文本作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的推理文本作为直接学习信号，与交互历史共同监督，创建跨域的用户和物品理解空间（Thought Space）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PULSE超越了领先的ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的顺序推荐模型，并在跨域推荐和推理问答等下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将推理文本作为一等学习信号，生成了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入表示，为高效且有效的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，仅提供二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释，无法满足实际内容审核需求。现有的解释-检测方法性能甚至不如简单的SFT基线。

Method: 提出ExPO-HM框架，结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵作为推理质量度量和奖励，灵感来源于人类标注员的训练评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量上达到最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升15%和17%的F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Conclusion: HDLM提供了一种通用的分层扩散语言建模框架，能够有效处理多粒度语义信息，在语言生成任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思想嵌入实现CoT压缩，使用小模型作为压缩器生成富含推理信息的嵌入，大模型作为执行器利用这些嵌入进行简短推理，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链式思维(CoT)在大型语言模型中实现了高级推理，但由于生成式LLMs的自回归特性，存在高计算成本和显著延迟损失的问题。现有CoT压缩方法要么需要繁琐的离散提示设计，要么构建外部压缩CoT数据集而牺牲关键推理细节。

Method: UCoT采用协作工作流程：第一阶段训练小模型(压缩器)生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化大模型(执行器)利用这些嵌入通过奖励机制得出正确答案并进行简短推理。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少了50%，性能比最先进方法高出3.08%，同时保持了强大的推理能力。

Conclusion: UCoT框架成功实现了高效的CoT压缩，避免了手动设计提示的缺点，在显著减少推理长度的同时保持了模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分析个人叙事风格的形式化框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，自动提取语言特征来分析作者表达主观体验时的语言选择模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事中作者通过语言风格来表达主观体验，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析叙事中的序列模式。

Result: 应用于数百个梦境叙事，包括对患有PTSD的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 语言选择模式与心理状态之间存在关联，该框架能够系统揭示个人叙事风格与心理体验之间的关系。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表的新型心理测量框架，通过实证选择最具信息量的LLM评分指令来提升测量精度，在抑郁症案例研究中实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富细微差别。本研究旨在利用LLM技术挖掘定性数据，增强传统心理测量工具。

Method: 开发结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的增强测试框架，使用真实世界高中生样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)进行验证，基于项目信息计算实证选择最优LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计显著改进。LLM项目带来的信息增益相当于为原始19项测试增加了6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用日益增长的转录文本流增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展方法，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值，代表了绕过传统自动化评分瓶颈的概念性转变。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散式大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)作为一种有前景的自回归模型替代方案，但由于缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架，其广泛应用受到限制。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件：模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略和KV缓存管理器，并结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，dInfer在HumanEval上达到1100+ tokens/秒，在六个基准测试中平均超过800 tokens/秒。相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的自回归模型QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer为扩散式大语言模型提供了一个高效、可扩展的推理框架，显著提升了推理效率而不损失模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对代码LLM的缩放定律进行了大规模实证研究，发现代码相比自然语言需要更高的数据-参数比，且Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言在语法严谨性等方面存在根本差异，需要验证这些定律是否适用于代码LLM。

Method: 进行了117次实验，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合了Chinchilla定律和Farseer定律，并进行了代码-自然语言混合实验。

Result: 代码LLM能有效随模型规模扩展，但代码是更数据饥渴的领域，需要比自然语言高得多的数据-参数比；Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确；在资源受限场景下自然语言有益，但在高计算预算下反而有害。

Conclusion: 代码LLM的缩放定律与自然语言不同，需要专门针对代码特性的缩放策略，特别是更高的数据-参数比。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 案例推理是美国法律实践的核心，但LLM在这种复杂、细致的推理形式中的能力需要进一步研究。

Method: 提出一个正式框架，将案例区分过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，组织成法律知识层次结构，并定义可验证的规则来识别区分、分析论证支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 现代推理LLM在表面推理（任务1）上准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上表现显著下降。模型在错误答案上消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法，揭示了必须解决的基本限制，以实现稳健可信的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Motivation: 现有基准存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误的问题，需要找到最小错误代码集和测试用例集来全面覆盖错误空间。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基，提出WrongSelect算法选择最大多样性的错误代码，构建TC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的测试生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗分数膨胀的基准，有效评估LLM生成测试用例的质量，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中传统基准测试时间成本过高的问题，探究微基准测试能否替代完整基准测试来一致性地排名模型。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准测试在不同模型性能差异下排名的可靠性，比较不同样本大小和采样方法的效果。

Result: 微基准测试需要250个样本才能稳定排名相似性能的模型，现有方法建议的10个样本无法保证排名一致性，随机采样在较大样本量时与现有方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要谨慎选择样本数量，为微基准测试用户和开发者提供实用指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Conclusion: LLM在地理编码任务中展现出强大的潜力，通过适当的策略和微调，较小的模型也能获得与大型模型相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保护其多语言响应，确保在不同语言和文化背景下的准确性和安全性。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，评估模型在五个维度上的多语言响应，涵盖低资源和高资源语言。

Result: GPT-5在所有类别中平均表现最佳，尤其在同意与自主权及伤害预防与安全类别中得分最高（3.56和4.73），而Gemini 2.5 Pro得分最低（1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化对LLM响应的影响，并改进模型在多语言环境中的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性、分层令牌选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，将Transformer注意力复杂度从O(n²)降低，保持95%性能的同时减少35-45%内存使用并提升1.8倍吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力随序列长度呈二次方增长(O(n²))，限制了长上下文应用，需要解决计算和内存效率问题。

Method: 使用伯努利门建模保留机制，通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，使方法可微分且可直接替代标准编码器。

Result: 在分类、抽取式问答和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的令牌即可保持≥95%的完整模型性能，峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升高达1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，为长上下文应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在中文语境下的综合评估研究不足，需要专门的中文常识多跳推理基准来评估模型整合中文特定事实知识与多步逻辑推理的能力。

Method: 首先从现有QA数据集中构建领域平衡的种子集，然后开发基于LLM的流水线生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题，并通过专家人工验证系统确保数据质量。

Result: 评估显示最先进的LLMs在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续局限，检索增强生成能显著缓解知识差距并带来性能提升。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLMs在中文多跳推理任务中的知识处理局限，检索增强是有效的缓解策略，为未来模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Motivation: 科学编码任务需要严谨的算法、深厚的领域知识和特定领域的推理，而现有方法在处理需要分解为子问题的复杂科学任务时存在局限性。

Method: 采用训练免费的多智能体框架，包含专门设计的智能体进行自反思、创建原理、编码和调试，结合学生-教师范式和整合上下文窗口(CCW)来减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架通过多智能体协作和上下文整合，有效解决了科学代码生成中的挑战，为复杂科学任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言结构对LLM隐私泄露的影响，发现意大利语隐私泄露最严重，英语在成员推理攻击中更易区分，而法语和西班牙语由于形态复杂性更高而更具韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多语言应用中部署增加，处理敏感数据时的隐私风险日益突出。目前主要针对英语进行评估，需要研究不同语言结构如何影响隐私泄露。

Method: 量化六个语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取攻击、反事实记忆和成员推理攻击，基于英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语的医疗语料库进行实验。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余性和分词粒度成正比：意大利语泄露最严重，英语在成员推理中区分度更高，法语和西班牙语由于形态复杂性而更具韧性。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供定量证据表明语言在隐私泄露中起重要作用，强调在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Search-on-Graph (SoG)框架，通过让LLM在知识图谱上进行迭代式导航来解决多跳知识问答问题，避免了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在知识密集型多跳问题上存在可靠性不足的问题，而传统KGQA方法面临查询编译困难、子图检索噪声大、搜索空间指数级增长等挑战。

Method: 采用"观察-导航"原则，设计单一Search函数让LLM在每一步检查当前实体的可用关系后决定下一跳，无需预规划路径或检索大子图。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在Wikidata上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase上也有一致改进。

Conclusion: SoG框架简单有效，能够适应不同知识图谱模式，处理高度节点，无需微调即可实现优异的KGQA性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PE-CoA框架，使用五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10个危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模式特定的漏洞和LLM行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，且对话模式与跨危害类别漏洞之间的关系研究不足。

Method: PE-CoA框架包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建多轮越狱攻击，评估了12个LLM在10个危害类别上的表现。

Result: 实现了最先进的性能，发现模型具有不同的弱点分布，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能推广到其他模式，模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

TL;DR: 本文评估了文档级质量估计重排序在机器翻译中的应用，发现使用SLIDE和GEMBA-DA等质量估计指标可以显著提升翻译质量，特别是在使用更多候选翻译时效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级机器翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，本文旨在探索其在文档级翻译中的效果。

Method: 使用多种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量估计指标（如SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译任务上进行重排序实验，比较不同候选数量下的性能提升。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20分数在2个候选翻译时提升+2.00，在32个候选时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，分别提升+1.63和+4.30。即使在长文档（512-1024个源标记）上，32个候选重排序仍能带来+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的提升。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小的运行时开销显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个针对财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性三个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使得财务审计难以自动化验证，而LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务：FinSM（语义一致性）、FinRE（关系一致性）、FinMR（数值一致性），并提出集成检索、分类和推理指标的统一评估框架。

Result: 对13个最先进LLM的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，在分层多文档结构上的推理准确率下降达60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类法的财务推理方面存在系统性限制，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知和法规对齐的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出一种在强化学习中为不同token类型应用不同温度设置的方法，通过提高推理token的温度来促进探索，同时保持知识token的低温以确保事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段显式促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，可分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 在采样过程中为不同token类型应用不同温度设置：对推理token使用较高温度以鼓励探索，对知识token使用较低温度以保持事实正确性。系统研究了多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式地在采样阶段为不同token类型应用差异化温度设置，可以有效促进探索并提升LLM的推理能力，同时保持事实准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在嵌套实体、实体边界模糊性和跨语言泛化方面存在困难，需要统一的解决方案来提升生物医学命名实体识别性能。

Method: 将BioNER重构为文本生成任务，设计符号标记策略处理平面和嵌套实体；进行中英文数据集的双语联合微调；引入基于对比学习的实体选择器过滤错误预测。

Conclusion: 提出的统一BioNER框架在生物医学命名实体识别任务中表现出色，特别是在处理嵌套实体和跨语言场景方面具有优势。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: SAC提出了一种新的上下文压缩方法，通过直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免了自编码训练，在多种压缩比下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法主要依赖自编码任务训练压缩token，但这种训练目标与下游任务存在不匹配，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接选择原始上下文中的锚点token，将上下文信息聚合到其KV表示中，包含锚点嵌入和双向注意力修改两个关键设计。

Result: 实验结果显示SAC在各种压缩比下都优于现有方法，在MRQA的分布外评估中，5倍压缩时比强基线提升1个EM分数，在更高压缩比下优势更明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过消除自编码训练需求，直接利用锚点token进行上下文压缩，在保持压缩性能的同时更好地服务于下游任务。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

<details>

Motivation: 研究LLM内部是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些模式如何影响模型的下游行为。

Method: 使用线性探针在生成的提示上预测基于二维刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的印象，分析隐藏表征中的印象可解码性。

Result: 发现LLM在被提示时不一致地报告印象，但从隐藏表征中能更一致地线性解码印象；人工印象能预测模型响应的质量和模糊语使用；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些模式与模型行为相关，且受提示特征影响。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

TL;DR: 提出了SOP-Maze基准，基于真实业务数据构建了397个任务，评估LLM在复杂标准操作流程中的表现，发现现有模型在流程遵循、对话处理和计算推理方面存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估LLM的指令遵循和决策能力，但缺乏对复杂业务场景中标准操作流程(SOP)执行能力的专门评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，包含23个复杂SOP场景的397个任务，分为横向根系统(LRS)和核心根系统(HRS)两类，分别评估宽选项选择和深度逻辑推理能力。

Result: 实验显示几乎所有最先进模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个主要错误类型：路线盲区(流程遵循困难)、对话脆弱性(无法处理真实对话细节)和计算错误(复杂上下文下的时间或算术推理错误)。

Conclusion: SOP-Maze基准为评估LLM在复杂业务流程中的能力提供了新视角，揭示了模型在流程遵循和深度推理方面的局限性，为改进模型能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on
https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照，将文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，通过熵值测量均匀性、丰富度测量多样性、Jensen-Shannon散度测量漂移来量化变化。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和行动，且分布更均匀，但规则组成保持稳定。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而发展，而非重大规范性转变，为评估AI工作流对权威分配的影响提供基线。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法使用静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的变化，导致训练在不同难度级别上失衡，阻碍整体性能提升。

Method: 提出DARO方法，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛速度更快，最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态权重调整有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，为强化学习与可验证奖励的结合提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

Motivation: Safety alignment is crucial for trustworthy AI but challenging to implement without degrading general performance. Current methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions.

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training that trains solely on safety data, with LoRA decoupling safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Result: LoRA effectively serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches without interfering with inherent model capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA-based approach provides a practical solution for safety alignment that preserves general performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

*Shengmin Piao,Jieun Lee,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitE-SQL是一个轻量高效的Text-to-SQL框架，通过模式检索器和两阶段微调的SQL生成器，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数数量，适用于隐私敏感和资源受限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于大型语言模型的Text-to-SQL方法依赖专有模型带来的部署可行性和数据隐私问题，提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：使用向量数据库进行高效模式链接的模式检索器，以及经过监督微调和执行引导强化学习两阶段微调的SQL生成器，支持自我修正而无需昂贵的多候选生成。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%的执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，性能与LLM方法相当或更优，同时参数数量减少2到30倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用轻量级模型可以实现高质量的Text-to-SQL生成，为隐私敏感和资源受限的场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 该研究通过迭代优化评分标准来提升LLM在自动作文评分中的表现，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上显著提高了评分一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，研究探索通过优化评分标准来提升自动作文评分效果。

Method: 通过让模型反思自身评分理由和与人工评分的差异，迭代优化评分标准，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct进行实验。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上，二次加权Kappa分别提升了0.19和0.47，即使使用简单初始评分标准也能达到或超过详细人工编写标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化对于基于LLM的自动作文评分至关重要，能显著提升与人工评价的一致性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源语言Chakma构建了孟加拉语转写的语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型，在掩码语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印欧语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足，需要解决这一资源匮乏问题。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中收集语料，经母语者验证后构建孟加拉语转写的Chakma语料库，然后对6种多语言Transformer模型进行掩码语言建模任务的微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在孟加拉语转写的Chakma上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写的Chakma对于Chakma语言的迁移学习非常有效，研究还揭示了数据质量对模型性能的影响以及OCR在形态丰富的印度文字上的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs内部状态无法可靠区分事实与幻觉，当幻觉与主题知识相关时，其内部处理过程与正确回答相同，导致无法检测；只有当幻觉与主题知识无关时，才能通过不同的表征模式进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部计算是否能可靠区分事实输出与幻觉输出，因为LLMs可能在编码事实性信号的同时也产生基于捷径或虚假关联的事实错误。

Method: 对LLMs处理事实查询进行机制分析，比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主题知识的幻觉和与主题知识无关的幻觉，分析其内部状态几何结构。

Result: 当幻觉与主题知识相关时，LLMs使用与正确回答相同的内部回忆过程，隐藏状态几何结构重叠且无法区分；而与主题知识无关的幻觉产生不同的聚类表征，可以被检测。

Conclusion: LLMs内部状态不编码真实性，只编码知识回忆的模式，表明"LLMs并不真正知道它们不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct模型，通过改进的自指导技术构建高质量多语言合成数据集，在100美元预算内为乌尔都语开发出高性能LLM，超越了多个主流多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发LLM面临的挑战：高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题，现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别且成本高昂。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术构建高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐，基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上表现优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等领先多语言LLM，训练预算低于100美元。

Conclusion: 通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言的LLM，并实现文化对齐，所有数据集、模型和代码均已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne是一个训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO提升推理模型的可信度，包括可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信度这一关键维度。

Method: 结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型生成结构化推理轨迹、明确披露决策信息、提供自我评估。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，ReFIne模型显著提升了可解释性(+44.0%)、忠实性(+18.8%)和可靠性(+42.4%)。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注可信度的多个维度。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程获取框架嵌入，结合上下文学习和深度度量学习，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(CLM)在多种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。本研究旨在探索CLM在此任务中的潜力，特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的语言如日语。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1) 使用提示工程获取输出单一框架名称的嵌入；2) 结合上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)优化嵌入质量；3) 对生成的嵌入进行聚类完成框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有框架归纳方法。特别是对于日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 证明了CLM在语义框架归纳任务中的有效性，特别是对于资源匮乏的语言，少量示例即可获得良好性能，为低资源语言的框架分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

TL;DR: 本文对检索增强生成(RAG)进行了全面综述，分析了RAG的目标、组件、挑战和应用，指出RAG在解决LLMs静态知识局限性的重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速变化的信息或领域特定查询，RAG通过结合外部检索机制来解决这一局限性。

Method: 本文采用综述研究方法，首先分析RAG的总体目标和核心组件，然后识别RAG面临的关键挑战和弱点，最后展示RAG与LLMs结合的应用案例。

Result: 研究发现，虽然LLMs自身能力不断增强，但RAG在特定场景下仍能显著提升LLMs的效能，特别是在处理动态信息和领域知识方面。

Conclusion: RAG仍然是解决LLMs知识局限性问题的重要方法，需要重新思考RAG的角色并开发下一代RAG系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准依赖表面指标，无法捕捉网络小说这一独特体裁的特点，需要专门评估框架来评估LLM在网络小说翻译中的表现。

Method: 构建DITING框架评估六个维度：成语翻译、词汇歧义、术语本地化、时态一致性、零代词解析和文化安全；提出AgentEval多智能体评估框架模拟专家审议；开发MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 评估14个模型发现：中文训练的LLM优于更大的国外模型；DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格连贯性方面表现最佳；AgentEval在七个自动指标中与人类判断相关性最高。

Conclusion: 为LLM网络小说翻译研究建立了新范式，提供了公开资源推动未来研究发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 现有的对话模型在模拟个体个性方面存在不足，希望通过思维表达话语来更准确地捕捉说话者的个性特征。

Method: 使用思维表达话语增强对话数据，训练个性LLM，并基于大五人格框架评估模型与说话者个性的对齐程度。

Result: 使用TAU增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质两个维度上比使用原始对话数据训练的模型更接近说话者的真实个性。

Conclusion: 思维表达话语增强能有效提升LLM对个体个性的建模能力，且增强质量对模型性能有重要影响。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以评估其保护个人身份信息的效果，需要更强的重新识别攻击来测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用多排序策略聚合预测结果，并引入推理模型来利用背景知识进行重新识别。

Result: 多排序聚合和推理模型都能显著提高重新识别的性能，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识的情况下。

Conclusion: 这两种策略能够构建更强的重新识别攻击，为评估文本去标识化方法的鲁棒性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，专门增强翻译的模型又缺乏推理能力。需要找到平衡两者能力的方法。

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据对特定层进行选择性调优，提出Qwen3-XPlus模型。

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上均有显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet。在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，同时保持15个推理数据集的熟练度。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型(SLMs)对大型语言模型(LLMs)的输出进行思维链修正，解决LLMs在推理任务中忽视用户特定格式要求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽略详细的输出格式要求，直接微调LLMs成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: 提出DICE框架：1) 通过两阶段方法构建结构化思维链适应数据集；2) 采用双重调优策略微调SLMs，以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明DICE将LLM输出的格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保留LLMs广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，提供了一种高效解决格式遵从问题的方法。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量，采用混合方法结合统计算法和LLM进行因果发现，并包含缺失变量提议组件来扩展因果图。

Result: 该方法能够实时进行因果发现，无需预先存在的数据集，能够发现已知和新颖的因果关系。

Conclusion: IRIS框架成功解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，实现了从初始变量开始的实时因果发现，能够同时发现已知和新颖的因果关系。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

### [161] [CrisiText: A dataset of warning messages for LLM training in emergency communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09243)
*Giacomo Gonella,Gian Maria Campedelli,Stefano Menini,Marco Guerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrisiText，这是首个用于在13种不同危机场景中生成警告信息的大规模数据集，包含超过40万条警告信息，旨在通过NLG技术帮助平民在危机期间获得及时警告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害或暴力袭击等危机情况下，及时识别威胁并减轻潜在损害至关重要。虽然AI已被用于协助人类应对紧急情况，但NLP技术的应用仍然有限，主要集中在分类任务上，而利用NLG架构生成及时警告信息的巨大潜力在很大程度上被忽视了。

Method: 从现有的危机描述出发，创建与场景相关的事件链，每个事件都配有一条警告信息。这些生成遵循专家编写的指南，确保术语正确性和建议的事实性。此外，每条信息还附带三种次优警告类型，以研究不同的NLG方法。

Result: 进行了系列实验，比较了监督微调设置与偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法。进一步评估了模型在分布外场景中的性能，并评估了自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集为危机场景下的警告信息生成提供了首个大规模资源，通过多种NLG方法的比较研究，展示了在紧急情况下生成及时有效警告信息的可行性。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤来增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在多个QA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖提示来激发模型的代理能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能上限和崩溃问题，未能充分发挥其代理潜力。

Method: 引入动态过滤序列级策略优化（DSPO），通过纯RL训练模型进行多轮搜索和推理交错，无需监督演示数据。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，DSPO训练的7B模型比同类先前工作提升34.1%，在复杂多跳QA如HotpotQA中甚至优于先前工作的14B模型近9%，且保持出色的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: DSPO算法能够有效提升LLM在复杂任务中的外部知识搜索能力，实现更好的性能表现和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Self-Critique方法，首个针对RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测方案，通过检测模型输出熵分布崩溃来识别污染数据，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RL后训练在提升LLM推理能力中日益重要，现有污染检测方法仅覆盖预训练和SFT阶段，缺乏针对RL阶段的专门方法，存在关键漏洞。

Method: 基于RL后训练导致模型输出熵分布崩溃为稀疏模式的关键观察，提出Self-Critique方法，通过探测底层策略崩溃（模型收敛到狭窄推理路径）来检测污染。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上的广泛实验表明，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，而现有方法对RL阶段污染接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: Self-Critique填补了RL后训练阶段污染检测的研究空白，使RL阶段污染检测成为可能，为可靠评估LLM性能提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，用于评估多模态检索增强生成模型在视频理解中的能力，发现现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出自适应视觉优化框架AVR来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面存在局限，主要关注单模态或有限模态任务，以及粗粒度的场景理解，需要更全面的评估基准

Method: 构建了包含599个公开视频和5360个开放式问答对的大规模人工验证基准CFVBench，并提出自适应视觉优化框架AVR，通过自适应增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来提升细粒度多模态理解

Result: 系统评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLM模型，发现当前模型在捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节方面存在严重瓶颈，而AVR框架能持续增强细粒度多模态理解并提升所有评估模型的性能

Conclusion: CFVBench基准测试揭示了当前MLLM模型在细粒度多模态理解方面的局限性，提出的AVR框架为解决这一问题提供了有效方案，能够显著提升模型在复杂视频内容理解上的表现

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的病例来评估大语言模型，比静态基准更贴近临床实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要依赖静态医学考试基准，与现实临床实践存在偏差，无法反映真实世界的模糊性和复杂性。

Method: DyReMe生成新鲜的咨询式病例，引入干扰因素如鉴别诊断和误诊因素，并评估准确性、真实性、帮助性和一致性四个维度。

Result: 实验表明动态评估更具挑战性和真实性，揭示了最先进LLM与真实临床实践之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

*Jiuheng Lin,Cong Jiang,Zirui Wu,Jiarui Sun,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity是一个成本效益高的强化学习框架，使用小型通用LLM来增强专家模型在稀缺数据领域的推理质量，通过一致性感知奖励机制和两阶段训练流程提高推理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖多项选择题。但标准的基于结果的强化学习有风险，可能提高准确性但降低推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有监督推理的解决方案如大规模过程奖励模型成本过高。

Method: CLARity框架整合了：1）一致性感知奖励机制；2）两阶段精炼-监控训练流程；3）动态数据重构策略以更好地利用有限数据。

Result: 实验显示CLARity相比基线方法提高了16.5%的响应一致性和7.5%的准确性。人工评估进一步确认了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: DualCSE是一种句子嵌入方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法仅为每个句子分配单个向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，在共享空间中为每个句子同时分配显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，可根据特定任务需求选择相应语义表示。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能够有效编码显式和隐式语义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双嵌入表示克服了传统句子嵌入方法的局限性，能够更好地捕捉句子语义，提升下游应用效果。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，这掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了模型发展的可靠评估

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计）来对抗参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性

Result: 实验表明MaP能产生更平滑的性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和真实的视角，为LLM研究奠定了重要的实证基础

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成可能限制性能。

Method: 构建中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，包含超过11万个案例，每个案例包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成任务上达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测任务上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1值。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large

construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个针对扩散大语言模型的训练无关缓存驱逐框架，通过mask-query评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少KV缓存内存占用，在仅保留5%令牌的情况下保持94%性能，实现31倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存驱逐策略是为自回归模型设计的，忽略了扩散模型的独特特性。

Method: 1) mask-query引导的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别和驱逐每个头中不太重要的提示令牌；2) 自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，将KV缓存压缩到仅256对（少于5%令牌），在LongBench上保持94%的完整缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型的缓存内存问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升效率，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法基于输出或激活，无法深入理解计算失败的原因，需要更深入的白盒分析方法。

Method: 使用基于归因图的电路推理验证方法，训练分类器识别正确与错误推理步骤在计算图中的结构特征差异。

Result: 发现错误的结构特征具有高度预测性，且在不同推理任务中表现出特定计算模式，通过针对性干预可纠正错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过分析模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的深入因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型参数量巨大，难以在资源受限硬件上部署。现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩比会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳

Method: FLRC方法为每层确定最优秩分配，并采用渐进式低秩解码技术来维持文本生成质量

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC在摘要任务上相比最先进的低秩压缩方法实现了17%的ROUGE-L提升

Conclusion: FLRC建立了一个更鲁棒和高效的框架来改进大语言模型推理

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决C2C平台上个人卖家在二手产品定价时面临的挑战，传统静态回归模型泛化性能差且无法捕捉市场动态。

Method: 使用LLM框架，先检索相似产品，然后通过监督微调(SFT)和分组相对策略优化(GRPO)两阶段优化，结合置信度过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采用率从40%提升到72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采用率。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著优于现有方法，能很好地泛化到未见过的类别，成功解决了二手产品定价问题。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

Motivation: 当前对小语言模型(SLM)的评估主要关注最终答案的准确性，而忽视了推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对SLM能力的错误估计。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，采用专家标注的数据集，并使用大型语言模型(LLM)作为自动评判器进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现14-24%的情况下SLM给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用LLM进行推理感知评估时，SLM在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，最多下降25%。

Conclusion: 仅基于最终答案的评估方法会高估SLM的能力，过程级评估对于准确评估SLM的推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种无需训练的解码时方法，使用小模型引导大模型进行长链推理，通过logit算术实现推理能力提升。ThinkLogit-DPO进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，显著提高推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型推理模型的长链推理能力是否可以在无需额外训练的情况下激发，探索使用小模型引导大模型进行推理的可行性。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，使用logit算术将小推理模型的推理能力传递给大非推理模型；ThinkLogit-DPO进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，使用正确/错误推理对进行优化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别实现平均准确率相对提升24.5%和29.1%，使用21倍小的引导模型成功提升大模型性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效且实用，可在不同模型家族间工作，与后训练方法正交，为无需昂贵后训练即可解锁大规模模型长推理能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

TL;DR: NL2GenSym框架将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，通过执行驱动的生成器-批评器机制，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了SOAR手动编码规则的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，这阻碍了其实际应用。大语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但现有研究缺乏实验验证。

Method: 提出NL2GenSym框架，包含基于LLM的生成器（使用RAG访问知识库）和批评器，通过执行验证和迭代优化来生成符号规则。

Result: 在水壶问题数据集上，框架成功生成规则的成功率超过86%，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym有效解决了SOAR规则生成的自动化问题，小参数模型也能获得更好性能，为认知架构的实用化提供了新途径。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究医学领域大语言模型的微调机制，提出tuning vectors框架来捕捉参数变化方向，发现微调主要修改小部分表示子空间，在MLP层写入新方向信息，在注意力头中放大现有方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，对领域专业化大语言模型的微调机制理解不足，特别是医学领域微调如何重塑参数空间尚不明确。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架（受task vectors启发），系统分析医学领域大语言模型的微调过程，研究参数变化方向和表示子空间修改。

Result: 微调仅修改小部分表示子空间，保持预训练模型表示；tuning vectors能提升指令跟随和生成质量；跨领域组合tuning vectors可改善泛化能力；MLP层写入新方向信息，注意力头放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应机制提供新见解，并提出一个通用、可解释的分析框架来理解大语言模型的专业化过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在链式思维推理中面临稀疏令牌奖励的挑战，现有方法依赖无差别的令牌级熵调整，常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO令牌级框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与令牌关联，实现令牌级聚合。

Result: 实验表明TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新SOTA并显著提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO框架有效解决了令牌级奖励稀疏性问题，为语言模型的推理能力提升提供了新方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Method: 开发了歧义分类法并提出量化指标，使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题验证指标，探索基于Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论和问题讨论框架的多轮对话策略。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多尺度图思维链（MSGCOT）提示框架，将多尺度结构信息整合到图提示中，通过从粗到细的粒度动态集成多尺度信息，形成渐进式提示链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示调优方法局限于单粒度（如节点级或子图级）的提示生成，忽视了图数据中固有的多尺度结构信息，这限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级、低秩粗化网络来高效捕获多尺度结构特征作为提示生成的层次基础向量，然后模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每个推理步骤动态集成多尺度信息。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中能够有效提升图提示调优的性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法依赖完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂。需要一种能高效识别最佳LLM的主动选择方法。

Method: 使用自适应查询选择策略，仅标注对模型选择最关键的少量查询，并利用基于判断器的标注模型进一步降低成本。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，该方法在选择最佳和接近最佳LLM时，标注成本降低高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR提供了一个高效的主动模型选择框架，显著减少了LLM评估的标注需求。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Motivation: 命名实体是文本知识的基本构建块，但LLM内部如何表示实体仍不清楚。现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身知之甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLM隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多token提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多token提及。

Result: LLM开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多token实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: LLM内部形成了专门的实体表示机制，能够有效编码和操作多token实体，这为理解LLM的知识表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Result: 完整口语历史输入在相似规模模型中表现最佳，显著超越先前方法；注意力池化压缩方法在保持竞争力的准确性的同时减少了上下文大小。

Conclusion: 通过更有效的上下文利用可以显著提升口语对话状态跟踪性能，注意力池化压缩提供了良好的精度与效率权衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for

evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a

specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模数据索引提供了可行方案，促进了向绿色计算的转型，并为LLM安全性和数据透明度提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Motivation: 尽管神经模型取得了显著进展，但其泛化能力（特别是逻辑推理等应用中的泛化能力）仍然是一个关键挑战。论文旨在明确区分组合性和递归性这两个泛化能力的基本方面，并研究LLMs在这两方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，评估预训练大语言模型的逻辑泛化能力。为了克服LLMs的局限性，提出了一种集成符号推理和神经计算的混合架构，其中神经组件加速处理，符号推理确保完整性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在递归性方面表现出合理的熟练度，但在组合性方面存在困难。实验表明，即使使用相对较小的神经组件，混合架构也能保持高效率。

Conclusion: 这种分析为混合模型提供了理论基础，并突出了混合模型在有效解决神经推理系统中关键泛化障碍方面的潜力。混合架构通过神经和符号组件的协同交互实现了稳健高效的推理。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural

TL;DR: 提出了多模态策略内化(MPI)任务，将复杂的多模态策略内化到模型参数中，无需在推理时包含策略文本，从而提升策略遵循能力并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代对话系统依赖预定义策略，但随着系统扩展，策略变得复杂冗长，导致遵循困难且计算成本高昂。多模态策略管理研究不足，现有方法主要关注文本压缩或安全规则对齐。

Method: 提出TriMPI三阶段训练框架：1)通过持续预训练注入策略知识；2)监督微调；3)PolicyRollout强化学习，使用策略感知响应进行探索。

Result: TriMPI在端到端准确性、泛化能力和抗遗忘鲁棒性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个多模态策略内化工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了第一个全面的统计学基准StatEval，包含13,817个基础问题和2,374个研究级证明任务，用于评估大语言模型的统计推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注数学和逻辑推理，而统计学作为一个独特且综合的学科在大语言模型评估中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 设计了可扩展的多智能体流水线，结合人工验证，自动化大规模问题提取、重写和质量控制，同时确保学术严谨性。

Result: 实验结果显示，闭源模型如GPT5-mini在研究级问题上准确率低于57%，开源模型表现更差，凸显了统计推理的独特挑战。

Conclusion: StatEval可作为推进大语言模型统计智能的严格基准，所有数据和代码已在web平台开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了在无标签情况下估计NLP模型性能的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据集漂移或零样本基线方法能产生更一致和更强的性能排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化时，无标签估计模型性能是一个重要目标。现有方法基于数据集相似性或预测正确性，但它们在跨域时产生可靠性能排名的条件尚不清楚。

Method: 使用四类基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集（涵盖15个领域）上进行两步评估实验，比较基于大语言模型的错误预测器与漂移基线和零样本基线的表现。

Result: 实验显示，基于大语言模型的错误预测器与真实准确率之间的排名相关性更强且更一致。当跨域性能差异较大，且错误模型的预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时，排名可靠性更高。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了性能估计方法在跨域模型评估中何时可信，并为其使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过集成口音分类和频谱图掩码增强技术，显著提升了英语和波斯语ASR模型在口音多样性下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练Transformer模型在ASR中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别并掩码对分类预测影响最大的区域，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强，提升ASR模型的口音鲁棒性。

Result: 在Whisper模型上的实验表明，该方法在英语和波斯语场景下均实现了显著的词错误率降低，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了多语言ASR系统的发展，使其能够更好地应对口音和方言多样性，并为低资源语言多样性语言的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: 提出GRSP方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡推理模型的效率和准确性，解决过度思考问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法在减少推理长度时会损害模型性能，因为token级监督过于简单

Method: 提出Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP)，基于推理段落的长度感知加权机制，进行步骤级正则化

Result: GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提高token效率，特别是在困难问题上优势明显，且能稳定RL训练并有效扩展到不同模型规模

Conclusion: 监督粒度对平衡推理模型的效率和准确性至关重要，GRSP通过步骤级方法实现了更好的性能平衡

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Dyna-Mind框架，通过模拟训练增强AI代理在复杂交互环境中的推理和决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在长时程交互任务中表现不佳，需要模拟未来状态的能力来提升性能

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段ReSim通过真实环境交互生成结构化推理轨迹；第二阶段Dyna-GRPO使用在线强化学习结合结果奖励和中间状态反馈

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld基准测试中，ReSim有效注入模拟能力，Dyna-GRPO学习到更好的长时程规划策略

Conclusion: 模拟在AI代理推理、规划和行动中发挥核心作用，能显著提升在复杂环境中的表现

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务中对拼写错误的鲁棒性，发现拼写错误会显著降低模型性能，特别是在生成任务和推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数基准测试假设输入是干净的，而实际应用中用户输入自然包含拼写错误，因此需要评估LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，基于语言特定的键盘布局和打字行为模拟人类拼写错误，评估了18个开源LLM在语言推理、多选问答、数学推理和机器翻译等5个任务上的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低模型性能，特别是在生成任务和推理任务中；指令调优提高了干净输入的性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言通常比低资源语言更鲁棒；从英语翻译比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估的必要性，为LLM在实际应用中的鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)虽然能并行解码多个token，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务奖励的对齐。现有基于证据下界(ELBO)的替代方法会产生显著的政策梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基于ELBO或一步估计的基线方法：GSM8K准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个推理任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 本文识别了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)，发现DLLMs仅在简单任务中实现真正并行解码，在复杂推理中会退化为自回归行为。作者提出了三个扩展维度和实用缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然提供高吞吐量和有效顺序推理，但并行解码与因果推理顺序要求存在冲突，限制了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 通过行为分析识别PSC问题，引入并行、扩散和顺序三个扩展维度进行实证研究，并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: 实验表明并行扩展能带来持续改进，但扩散和顺序扩展受PSC限制。自回归提示会使解码步骤翻倍且不提升质量。

Conclusion: PSC限制了DLLMs的自反性、推理深度和探索广度，需要通过并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等策略来缓解PSC导致的低效问题。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多语言医学视频检索中现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗糙嵌入，要么细粒度匹配成本过高的问题。

Method: 将视频字幕分成语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实丰富，构建分层树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入，采用粗到细的树搜索策略，最后用轻量级LLM重新评分。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进性能，消融研究证实了知识图谱增强、分层索引和LLM重新排名的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型越来越多地依赖思维链推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间思考过程本身仍然研究不足。

Method: 研究评估了语言合规性、答案准确性和一致性；通过跨语言交换思考痕迹来评估一致性；采用截断和错误注入等扰动技术来探测思考痕迹的忠实性。

Result: 发现模型对不同语言有强烈偏好，性能差异明显；思考痕迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对思考痕迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言思维链推理存在显著的语言偏好和性能差异，思考痕迹的质量和有效性受语言影响，模型对思考痕迹的依赖程度因语言而异。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 构建了包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估了17个不同规模和训练方式的语言模型在新实体推理任务上的表现。

Result: 调整语言模型以展示推理行为能显著改善大多数连接词类型的表现，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上都存在系统性困难。

Conclusion: 研究为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路，揭示了连接词类型对模型推理能力的重要影响。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

Conclusion: MPS框架有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，实现了类似人类思考与说话并行的能力

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

*Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS)方法，仅使用90个手动选择推理实例，通过测试时指令提示强度变化来合成多样化推理轨迹，显著提升LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量人工标注的推理数据集，成本高昂且资源密集。P-TTS旨在以最小标注开销有效提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 使用仅90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统变化测试时指令提示强度来合成多样化推理轨迹上下文，然后对Qwen-2.5模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，P-TTS-7B和32B模型显著优于基线，在AIME'24上分别获得+26.66%和+30.00%的绝对准确率提升，在零样本泛化测试中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放有效探索了推理模式的潜在空间，以最小标注开销放大了LLM问题解决能力，为资源受限或快速演进领域提供了实用的低成本LLM推理激发方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and
future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless
connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications.
However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend
critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive
survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne
platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced
Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with
generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing
related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we
explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide
representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct
additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include
raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories,
spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a
5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor
network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various
scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios.
References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable
full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community
toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models,
developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of
aerial wireless systems.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了DePSAC方案，通过延迟感知奖励函数和Boltzmann探索机制，在5G网络切片中实现更好的QoS-利润权衡，相比基线方法在利润、延迟、接受率和资源消耗方面均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL框架主要关注利润优化而忽略服务延迟，可能导致延迟敏感切片的QoS违规；同时epsilon-greedy探索导致收敛不稳定和策略学习次优。

Method: 基于DRL的延迟和利润感知切片准入控制方案，采用延迟感知奖励函数对服务延迟施加惩罚，并使用Boltzmann探索实现更平滑快速的收敛。

Result: 在模拟5G核心网络上的实验表明，DePSAC在整体利润、URLLC切片延迟降低、接受率提升和资源消耗改善方面优于DSARA基线方法。

Conclusion: DePSAC方案在实用5G网络切片场景中实现了更好的QoS-利润权衡，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: 5G networks enable diverse services such as eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC through
network slicing, necessitating intelligent admission control and resource
allocation to meet stringent QoS requirements while maximizing Network Service
Provider (NSP) profits. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks focus primarily on profit optimization without explicitly accounting
for service delay, potentially leading to QoS violations for latency-sensitive
slices. Moreover, commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration of DRL often results
in unstable convergence and suboptimal policy learning. To address these gaps,
we propose DePSAC -- a Delay and Profit-aware Slice Admission Control scheme.
Our DRL-based approach incorporates a delay-aware reward function, where
penalties due to service delay incentivize the prioritization of
latency-critical slices such as URLLC. Additionally, we employ Boltzmann
exploration to achieve smoother and faster convergence. We implement and
evaluate DePSAC on a simulated 5G core network substrate with realistic Network
Slice Request (NSLR) arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method outperforms the DSARA baseline in terms of overall profit, reduced
URLLC slice delays, improved acceptance rates, and improved resource
consumption. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed DePSAC
in achieving better QoS-profit trade-offs for practical 5G network slicing
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于众包测量的不确定性感知和可解释的下行用户吞吐量估计方法，分析了从4G到5G SA演进中吞吐量瓶颈从无线接入网向传输和服务层转移的趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络容量提升使连接瓶颈转向网络深层，传统方法如路测和运营商计数器成本高、覆盖有限，无法捕获端到端服务质量及其变异性。

Method: 利用大规模众包测量数据，包括端到端、无线、上下文和网络部署特征，采用NGBoost模型输出点估计和校准置信区间。

Result: 验证并改进了4G方法（R²提升8.7%），首次为5G众包数据集提供基准，显示吞吐量瓶颈从无线接入网向传输和服务层转移。

Conclusion: 端到端指标重要性超过无线相关特征，表明5G网络中吞吐量瓶颈已从无线接入网转移到传输和服务层。

Abstract: Characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks
is increasingly challenging as the higher capacity of the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN) shifts connectivity bottlenecks towards deeper parts of the
network. Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment
counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of
Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale
crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network
deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an
uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput
estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then
extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G
crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply
NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence
intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications.
Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA,
and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service
layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.

Method: 引入动态超图学习捕获高阶非成对关系；提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动力学微分方程转换为线性系统，利用物理信息神经微分方程确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂网络动态预测中的高阶关系捕获和可解释性问题，在准确性和长期预测性能方面表现优异。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现创造了机会，需要支持假设狩猎过程

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，使用具有异质行为的LLM研究代理自组织成演化网络

Result: 实验显示社交动态能够沿多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路和提出新治疗靶点

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社交结构化的代理网络可以大规模持续进行探索性假设狩猎

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统车辆路径规划在真实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 提出一个框架，使用大语言模型根据政策标准批判车辆路径规划生成的路线，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。生成了400个案例进行标注和评估。

Result: 开源大语言模型识别路线问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高达到86%。基于大语言模型的评估可作为超越传统距离和时间指标的有效可扩展评估层。

Conclusion: 大语言模型评估车辆路径规划路线的方法可有效提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家的最后一公里物流。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Motivation: 解决现有模块化架构中导航规划与视觉世界建模分离导致的动作状态不对齐问题，以及在新颖或动态场景中适应性有限的问题。

Method: 采用统一记忆增强世界模型，在单一多模态自回归主干中集成自我中心视觉预测和规划，通过分层记忆机制结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，并在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性进展，通过紧密对齐预测与控制来提升导航的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法缺乏对算法表现不佳原因的解释和针对性改进，导致生成的算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch在最差情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有所改善，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供表现不佳实例的解释和针对性设计建议，可以显著提升生成启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过分离战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理来解决LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理存在小错误累积、幻觉和失去连贯性的问题，上下文管理成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：主代理执行推理和工具使用，元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预，上下文管理器维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练管道进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

Motivation: 随着AI写作工具普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是评估中的归因偏见问题。

Method: 使用雷蒙·格诺《风格练习》进行对照实验：研究1比较人类和AI在盲测、准确标签和反事实标签下评估文学段落；研究2测试AI评估者和创作者14×14矩阵中的偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7%偏见，AI显示+34.3%偏见（2.5倍于人类）。AI系统会因"AI生成"标签而系统性地贬低创意内容，无论实际创作者是谁。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制还放大了这种偏见，导致评估标准因感知作者身份而颠倒。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Motivation: 需要一种系统性的方法来评估智能体的操作循环，覆盖从目标设定到行动执行的完整过程，以全面检测智能体的各类失败模式。

Method: 基于智能体操作循环（设定目标、制定计划、执行行动）构建评估框架，包含目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度五个评估指标。

Result: 在TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集和生产级数据智能体上的实验表明，该框架能覆盖所有智能体错误，LLM评估与人类标注的一致性达80%-95%，错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统化方法，能够有效识别和定位智能体失败，支持针对性的性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

TL;DR: 提出了ReviewerToo框架，通过AI辅助同行评审来补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审中存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，探索AI如何辅助科学出版评审流程。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持使用专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准进行系统实验，可部分或完全集成到实际会议工作流程中。

Result: 在1,963篇ICLR 2025论文上的实验显示，AI评审在事实核查、文献覆盖方面表现优异，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足。AI生成的评审质量高于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂的评估判断仍需领域专家。提出了将AI集成到同行评审流程的指导原则，为构建系统化混合评审系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [215] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策融入LLM的对齐过程，在推理时通过构建收益矩阵选择对用户和模型都有利的行动，在训练时引入互惠奖励来强化合作行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就等于最大化用户福利，但实际上LLM经常生成冗长或过度澄清的回答，而用户更喜欢简洁答案，这种个体理性选择导致社会次优结果。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互建模为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还提出了基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign显著提高了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了用户和模型的双赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LM Fight Arena是一个新颖的基准测试框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估它们在实时对抗环境中的视觉理解和战术决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法真实反映它们在实时对抗环境中的表现，需要开发能评估动态战略推理能力的测试方法。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试6个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步动作。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可复现且客观的评估框架，能够衡量LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 该工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染，准确率达到93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的LLM评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真正推理能力来获得高性能。

Method: 提取37个特征，涵盖表面级置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，在清晰案例中表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例中达到76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面级指标推进LLM评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是处理多模态信息的能力。

Method: 创建了93个问题的人工数据集，涵盖文本、表格、图像和多模态数据；开发了短语级召回指标和最近邻嵌入分类器来检测幻觉；比较了开源和闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差异更大；人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致（4.62/5和4.53/5）。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的整体性能，闭源模型在多模态处理方面表现更好，提出的指标与人类评估高度一致。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，利用多跳关联检索和动态关系推理来回答复杂问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆。作者希望开发一个类似的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架，用于复杂问题回答。

Method: 索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据，减少token消耗；检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，EcphoryRAG将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，相比HippoRAG等强基线方法提升了性能，token消耗减少了94%。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式对于复杂问题回答具有显著效果，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，在科学推理基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究框架存在的三个主要问题：上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱，这些限制了多步骤科学推理的准确性和稳定性。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。采用分层本地相关性函数、种子锚定语义扩散和因果语义路径匹配，并通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在HLE和GPQA科学推理基准上取得有竞争力的性能，使用InternAgent系统的日志文件，在HLE上准确率提升7.7%，在GPQA上提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为深度研究系统的补充，能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重建答案，显著提升科学推理性能。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件，并自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现知识与LLM的深度融合，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的prefix-tuning方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的关系语义，给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。需要更深入的知识融合方法。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域中提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现特征层面的深度知识交互。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快的推理速度和更高的准确性，统一了多任务多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在推理效率方面面临模型规模大、过度思考、轻量级场景下准确性受损等挑战，而针对轻量级MLLM推理能力的研究相对缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段提出LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整组内响应优势，优先简洁高质量响应；第二阶段提出AMM模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上表现出优越性能，使轻量级模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V证明了轻量级模型通过两阶段优化策略可以在多模态推理任务中实现高效且准确的性能，为轻量级MLLM的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估旅行规划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发评估器，并测试多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；RL方法在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，RL方法在提高规划可行性方面表现优异，为旅行规划任务提供了可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在奥林匹克数学问题上的进步，需要评估它们在证明评分方面的能力，特别是检测错误和分配公平分数，而不仅仅是二元正确性判断。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的90个解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，引入基于代理的工作流程来提取参考解决方案并自动推导问题特定的评分标准。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误解决方案，但在部分学分分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分学分处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于代理的工作流程能显著提高证明评分的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 现有正则表达式修复方法面临两难：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM泛化性强但可靠性不足

Method: 先使用符号模块定位漏洞子模式，再用LLM生成该隔离片段的语义等价修复

Result: 修复率比现有最佳方法提升15.4个百分点，能解决规则方法无法处理的复杂修复案例

Conclusion: LRR框架成功结合了LLM的泛化能力和符号方法的可靠性，为自动修复问题提供了有效方法

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著降低上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集大量轨迹，在真实GUI基准测试中显著提升长任务和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要一种可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨界面和长任务泛化能力。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹和验证成功来低成本扩展记忆；仅微调记忆编码器（1.2%参数）。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能；仅用1,500样本和约4000美元成本收集100k+轨迹。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理在长任务和分布偏移下的性能，以低成本实现与顶级闭源模型相当的效果，为GUI代理的可扩展记忆提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发三种人工意识（自我意识、潜意识、前意识），设计16种MBTI人格角色，创建10种不同情境评估模型的认知能力，采用调查评估、ChatGPT三级分类和定性审查三种方式评估决策过程。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型成功模拟了意识认知，但不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不够显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观和适应性强的类人意识AI系统，为改善AI在复杂认知情境中的交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

*Joonghyuk Hahn,Soohan Lim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MEC³O多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，显著提升了代码时间复杂度预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码时间复杂度预测中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，需要一种机制来整合各模型在不同类别上的优势。

Method: MEC³O系统：1）基于性能将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别；2）提供类别专业化指令，将模型转化为专家；3）专家进行结构化辩论；4）通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线准确率和macro-F1分数至少提升10%，在macro-F1上平均超越GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini达到竞争性水平。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样来发现多样模式，这一过程成本高且效率低下。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键是将扰动投影到与生成流正交的方向，以在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性的解释，说明为何生成质量能够稳健保持，理论上显示单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和反应中的重要性。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，提出强化学习框架训练智能体优化话语的说服效果。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中，所提出的智能体显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但部署时计算成本高昂。现有动态切换方法存在额外推理错误且缺乏性能损失的统计保证，这在关键应用中至关重要

Method: 构建性能损失的置信上界，将其表示为不确定性得分的单调函数，然后确定切换到非思考模型的阈值。理论上，使用该阈值在思考和非思考模式间切换可确保分布无关的有界性能损失

Result: 在推理基准测试上的综合实验表明，该方法能够节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为大型推理模型提供了统计保证的效率改进，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否考虑医疗的社会性质，特别是对健康差异和偏见的处理，以确保公平的患者支持。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案向LLMs提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人群体获得的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉性群体中这种差异更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对LLMs日益增长的信任，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保不转化为不公正的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，用于评估LLMs和LRMs的空间计算限制，发现模型在处理需要大量搜索空间探索的问题时存在常见失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但PSPACE完全问题能更严格地评估模型的计算能力，因为其解决方案需要大规模搜索空间探索。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了包含超过100万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，使用6个LLMs和5个LRMs进行广泛评估。

Result: 揭示了模型在处理PSPACE完全正则表达式问题时的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，证明了现有模型在空间计算能力上的局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对LLMs和LRMs的空间计算限制进行了实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统LLM在现实世界任务中存在局限性，研究旨在开发能够自动化复杂任务、弥合与人类能力差距的智能体化LLM。

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的系统：感知系统（将环境感知转换为有意义表示）、推理系统（制定计划、适应反馈、评估行动）、记忆系统（通过短期和长期机制保留知识）、执行系统（将内部决策转化为具体行动）。

Result: 集成这些系统能够创建更强大和通用的软件机器人，模拟人类认知过程实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过整合感知、推理、记忆和执行系统，可以构建出能够模仿人类认知过程、具备自主智能行为的更强大LLM智能体。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域中，同时满足可解释性和高性能的需求。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过局部性调节参数动态控制表示的局部化程度。

Result: 数学证明显示，当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架支持在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，适用于需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Motivation: 传统约束编程中基于后继变量的模型无法有效处理可选访问或插入式启发式算法，这限制了CP在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量，包括其域定义、更新操作和一致性级别，设计了专门的数据结构以集成到现有CP求解器中，并开发了针对序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Conclusion: 序列变量为车辆路径问题提供了更直观和强大的建模框架，能够有效处理可选访问和插入启发式，扩展了约束编程在复杂路由问题中的应用能力。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test

Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves

reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [243] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的基准测试，具有高质量测试用例和离线评估系统，评估显示GPT-5达到81.76百分位但仍落后于顶尖人类选手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试缺乏足够挑战性的问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API限制可访问性，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的题目，每个题目平均60个专家设计的测试用例，建立包含详细子任务评分标准和私有测试用例的基准。

Result: 评估32个主流LLM，GPT-5达到81.76百分位，但落后于通常超过90百分位的顶尖人类选手；开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位。

Conclusion: 强大推理模型应优先精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [244] [Web Crawler Restrictions, AI Training Datasets \&amp; Political Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09031)
*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 分析显示AI爬虫限制在网站中日益增长，且限制模式因网站流行度和内容类型而异，可能导致训练数据偏向低质量或极化内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着内容创作者越来越多地阻止AI爬虫以保持对其数据的控制，研究这种限制对训练数据构成的潜在下游影响。

Method: 分析自2023年以来访问量最大的前一百万个网站的爬虫限制情况，按网站流行度和内容类型检查限制模式。

Result: 前1000名网站中有四分之一限制AI爬虫，前100万网站中降至十分之一。新闻媒体限制率较高（34.2%），高事实报道媒体达55%。政治立场中立的网站限制最强（58%），而右倾网站限制最少（仅4.1%）。

Conclusion: 异质性的阻止模式可能使训练数据集偏向低质量或极化内容，影响主要AI即服务提供商所服务模型的能力。

Abstract: Large language models rely on web-scraped text for training; concurrently,
content creators are increasingly blocking AI crawlers to retain control over
their data. We analyze crawler restrictions across the top one million
most-visited websites since 2023 and examine their potential downstream effects
on training data composition. Our analysis reveals growing restrictions, with
blocking patterns varying by website popularity and content type. A quarter of
the top thousand websites restrict AI crawlers, decreasing to one-tenth across
the broader top million. Content type matters significantly: 34.2% of news
outlets disallow OpenAI's GPTBot, rising to 55% for outlets with high factual
reporting. Additionally, outlets with neutral political positions impose the
strongest restrictions (58%), whereas hyperpartisan websites and those with low
factual reporting impose fewer restrictions -only 4.1% of right-leaning outlets
block access to OpenAI. Our findings suggest that heterogeneous blocking
patterns may skew training datasets toward low-quality or polarized content,
potentially affecting the capabilities of models served by prominent
AI-as-a-Service providers.

*Patrick Gerard,Luca Luceria,Leonardo Blas,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于网络邻近度的跨平台信息传播预测方法，通过构建平台无关的话语网络来预测内容在不同平台间的传播模式，无需依赖用户追踪或共享标签等脆弱信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨平台信息传播模型将平台视为孤立系统，忽视了跨平台活动可能带来的预测性模式，需要更有效的方法来预测内容在不同平台间的传播。

Method: 将跨平台预测构建为网络邻近问题，通过共享叙事参与连接用户，构建平台无关的话语网络，利用网络邻近度作为预测信号。

Result: 该方法显著优于传统传播模型和其他基线方法，仅需不到3%的活跃用户即可进行预测，在2024年美国选举期间的570万社交媒体帖子测试中，AUC超过94%，能提前识别新兴叙事。

Conclusion: 基于话语网络邻近度的跨平台预测方法具有高度可扩展性和有效性，能够为主动干预提供足够的提前时间，是预测跨平台信息传播的有力工具。

Abstract: Online narratives spread unevenly across platforms, with content emerging on
one site often appearing on others, hours, days or weeks later. Existing
cross-platform information diffusion models often treat platforms as isolated
systems, disregarding cross-platform activity that might make these patterns
more predictable. In this work, we frame cross-platform prediction as a network
proximity problem: rather than tracking individual users across platforms or
relying on brittle signals like shared URLs or hashtags, we construct
platform-invariant discourse networks that link users through shared narrative
engagement. We show that cross-platform neighbor proximity provides a strong
predictive signal: adoption patterns follow discourse network structure even
without direct cross-platform influence. Our highly-scalable approach
substantially outperforms diffusion models and other baselines while requiring
less than 3% of active users to make predictions. We also validate our
framework through retrospective deployment. We sequentially process a
datastream of 5.7M social media posts occurred during the 2024 U.S. election,
to simulate real-time collection from four platforms (X, TikTok, Truth Social,
and Telegram): our framework successfully identified emerging narratives,
including crises-related rumors, yielding over 94% AUC with sufficient lead
time to support proactive intervention.

Motivation: 随着Community Notes模型在社交媒体平台中的推广，需要评估其底层动态和有效性，为未来研究提供基础。

Method: 解析四年项目数据，进行语言检测，提取英文笔记中的URL和话题，构建贡献者月度互动网络。

Result: 提供了系统文献综述和主要数据集及源代码，为Community Notes研究提供了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 这些资源为推进Community Notes系统研究提供了稳健的基础支持。

Abstract: Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch) is the first large-scale
crowdsourced content moderation initiative that was launched by X (formerly
known as Twitter) in January 2021. As the Community Notes model gains momentum
across other social media platforms, there is a growing need to assess its
underlying dynamics and effectiveness. This Resource paper provides (a) a
systematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated
dataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community
Notes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the
program and conducted language detection across all Notes. Focusing on
English-language Notes, we extracted embedded URLs and identified discussion
topics in each Note. Additionally, we constructed monthly interaction networks
among the Contributors. Together with the literature review, these resources
offer a robust foundation for advancing research on the Community Notes system.

TL;DR: 本研究评估开源大语言模型在本地部署环境下作为意图驱动操作系统核心组件的可行性，并与GPT-4进行性能对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于云端专有模型的实现存在隐私、自主性和可扩展性限制，需要探索本地可部署的开源模型作为未来意图操作系统的核心组件。

Method: 对多个开源和开放访问模型进行评估，与OpenAI的GPT-4系统进行对比分析，测试其在生成用户意图工作流方面的性能。

Result: 研究提供了关于开源LLMs作为下一代操作系统自主本地可操作组件的实际可行性、性能权衡和潜力的实证见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持AI基础设施的去中心化和民主化，指向通过本地嵌入式智能实现更无缝、自适应和隐私保护的用户设备交互未来。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

### [248] [Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609)
*Imranur Rahman,Jill Marley,William Enck,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束类型对依赖过时和漏洞风险的影响，发现浮动次要版本约束是最可能导致过时和漏洞的约束类型，而浮动主版本约束最不容易过时，浮动次要版本约束最不容易产生漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者使用版本约束来管理依赖，固定依赖(pinning)可以减少破坏性变更风险但需要手动管理更新，浮动依赖(floating)能自动获取修复但存在破坏性变更风险。安全实践者推荐固定依赖以防止供应链攻击，但固定依赖最可能导致依赖过时。目前尚不清楚不同版本约束类型对依赖过时和漏洞风险的具体影响。

Method: 首先识别npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束的使用趋势和开发者更改模式，然后使用生存分析建模依赖状态转换，估计使用固定依赖相比其他约束类型时依赖过时或产生漏洞的可能性变化。

Result: 在过时和存在漏洞的依赖中，最常用的版本约束类型是浮动次要版本约束，固定依赖次之。浮动主版本约束最不容易导致依赖过时，浮动次要版本约束最不容易导致依赖存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发者在选择依赖版本约束时做出明智决策，了解不同约束类型对依赖过时和漏洞风险的具体影响。

Abstract: Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable
versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can
reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually
managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other
hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security
fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners
advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain
attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the
tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in
outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or
vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The
goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency
version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of
dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at
scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version
constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by
developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the
dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the
likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning}
as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among
outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint
type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common.
We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in
outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable
dependencies.

*Imranur Rahman,Md Rayhanur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的上下文收集策略，通过代码分块和相对定位来提升LLMs在代码补全任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDE中的代码补全功能缺乏对有效上下文的研究，需要确定基于IDE可用信息的最佳上下文来提升大语言模型的代码补全性能。

Method: 将代码库预处理为小代码块，然后使用基于语法和语义相似性的代码块检索方法，并在最终上下文中使用相对定位。

Result: 代码分块和代码块的相对定位能够提高代码补全任务的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文收集策略能够有效提升LLMs在代码补全任务中的表现。

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the
development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern
integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what
makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to
the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper,
we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in
performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to
preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and
semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We
found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final
context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在软件开发生命周期中对团队协作的影响，通过文献综述、行业案例、团队调查和案例研究，发现LLM能提升效率、改善沟通，但也带来模型局限性和隐私问题等新挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地集成到软件开发过程中，需要了解它们如何影响团队协作流程和生产力，以及如何应对由此产生的新挑战。

Method: 采用文献综述、行业案例研究、团队调查和两个案例研究的方法，评估LLM辅助工具对协作软件工程实践的影响。

Result: 研究发现LLM能显著提高效率（通过自动化重复性任务和文档）、增强沟通清晰度、促进跨职能协作，但同时也引入了模型局限性和隐私问题等新挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在软件团队协作中具有显著潜力，未来研究方向包括领域特定模型定制、改进开发工具集成以及确保信任和安全的稳健策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
development processes, with the potential to transform team workflows and
productivity. This paper investigates how LLMs affect team collaboration
throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We reframe and update a
prior study with recent developments as of 2025, incorporating new literature
and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and
explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making
in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey,
and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code
generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on
collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs
can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and
documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional
collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and
privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research
questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest
future research directions including domain-specific model customization,
improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring
trust and security.

*Ha Min Son,Huan Ren,Xin Liu,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了GradleFixer，一个专门用于修复Android构建错误的LLM代理，通过领域特定工具显著提升了构建错误修复的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android作为最大的移动平台，自动构建应用仍面临挑战。虽然LLM在代码修复方面有潜力，但在修复Android构建错误方面的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先创建AndroidBuildBench基准测试集，包含1,019个构建失败案例；然后提出GradleFixer，这是一个配备领域特定工具的LLM代理，用于检查和操作Gradle构建环境。

Result: GradleFixer实现了81.4%的解决率（pass@1），显著优于依赖通用shell的最先进编码代理。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虽然LLM具备解决构建失败的高层知识，但使用通用shell将其转化为有效底层操作存在困难。提出的工具桥接策略通过提供API格式的工具和约束操作空间，成功弥合了高层推理与底层执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building
applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a
benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43
open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution
from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose
GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and
manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate
of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent
that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that
while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they
struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a
general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term
Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware
abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it
provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it
constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the
gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出Faver方法，通过函数抽象的可验证中间件简化基于LLM的RTL生成流程，将电路验证细节与功能实现分离，提高生成准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在RTL生成中面临语义鸿沟大、训练数据有限的问题，导致生成准确性不足。受人类设计验证经验启发，但RTL测试数据稀缺且LLM对高级语言更擅长

Method: 使用函数抽象的可验证中间件(Faver)，混合LLM友好的代码结构和基于规则的模板，解耦电路验证细节，让LLM专注于功能本身

Result: 在SFT模型和开源模型上的实验表明，Faver将模型生成准确性提高了最高14%

Conclusion: Faver方法有效解决了LLM在RTL生成中的语义鸿沟问题，通过验证中间件显著提高了生成准确性

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds
the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design.
However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications
and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with
generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification
helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more
scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level
languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When
implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ
significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to
consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level
details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we
propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines
RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures
with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit
verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our
experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's
generation accuracy by up to 14%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于ReAct范式的可控代码生成框架，通过多智能体协作实现安全、准确、可解释的代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成模型在安全性、准确性和可控性方面存在不足，缺乏动态工具集成、透明推理和用户安全控制。

Method: 采用四智能体协作架构：规划器任务分解、基于ReAct的搜索器推理和工具集成、代码生成器准确编码、提取器结构化数据检索。

Result: 在SVEN数据集上达到94.8%的安全率，优于现有方法，支持多语言代码生成。

Conclusion: 该框架通过透明推理过程增强用户信任，提高了代码生成的可控性和安全性。

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide
adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and
controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack
dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control
over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation
framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This
framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and
interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and
external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture
comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a
Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration,
a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured
data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating
reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of
internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance
accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's
effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the
SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent
reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

TL;DR: 提出基于RAG的框架，集成Sentence-Transformers和FAISS向量搜索，为JIRA工单提供上下文感知的解决方案推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件团队在处理重复或相关问题时常因知识分散在JIRA工单、开发者讨论和GitHub PR中而遇到延迟。

Method: 使用语义嵌入技术嵌入历史JIRA工单、用户评论和关联的PR元数据，通过FAISS向量搜索检索相似历史案例，再由LLM合成基于检索证据的解决方案建议。

Result: 实验评估显示，该系统在解决准确性、修复质量和知识重用方面显著改善，减少了解决时间并提高了开发者接受度。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一JIRA和GitHub数据、异构软件工件的嵌入索引策略以及基于检索证据的解决方案生成模块，有效提升了DevOps环境中的问题解决效率。

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or
related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets,
developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this
challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that
integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based
vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The
approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata
to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a
Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution
suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and
GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous
software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved
evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time
reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system
significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in
modern DevOps environments.

real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

TL;DR: 使用差分进化算法调优DynaMOSA和MIO多目标搜索算法的超参数，相比基本网格搜索更高效，能显著提高测试套件的覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索式测试生成算法有众多配置选项，用户通常使用默认值，但这些默认值可能无法获得最佳结果。超参数调优可以找到更好的参数值，但通常需要大量资源。

Method: 使用差分进化算法作为元启发式搜索方法，调优Pynguin框架中DynaMOSA和MIO多目标搜索算法的超参数。

Result: 调优后的DynaMOSA算法能显著提高测试套件的覆盖率，且差分进化比基本网格搜索更高效。

Conclusion: 差分进化是调优搜索式测试生成算法超参数的有效方法，能显著提升测试覆盖率且效率更高。

Abstract: Search-based test-generation algorithms have countless configuration options.
Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values,
which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's
hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it
typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search
algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been
proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we
explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the
hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as
implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant
improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned
DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic
grid search.

TL;DR: 开发了PyMigTool，一个结合LLM、静态分析和动态分析的端到端Python库迁移工具，能够自动迁移任意功能相似的Python库之间的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动库迁移耗时且容易出错，现有自动化技术大多停留在API映射阶段或支持有限的库和代码转换。

Method: 使用大型语言模型作为主要迁移引擎，结合静态分析和动态分析进行后处理，开发了PyMigTool命令行应用。

Result: 在717个真实Python应用上评估，PyMigTool能够完全正确迁移32%的案例，剩余迁移中超过一半项目只有14%的迁移相关变更需要开发者修复。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效执行库迁移，结合后处理步骤可以进一步提升性能，PyMigTool为Python库迁移提供了实用的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Library migration is the process of replacing a library with a similar one in
a software project. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,
as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces
(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code
transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most
of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage
or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,
we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between
any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due
to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.
Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library
migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that
LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps
can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a
command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and
dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool
on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find
that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of
the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left
for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在学习编程时会产生各种误解，这些误解不仅会导致bug和低效代码，还会阻碍相关概念的学习。

Method: 开发了可扩展的误解基准数据集和大量包含误解的代码样本，引入了两种基于LLM的McMiner方法。

Result: 通过广泛评估表明，Gemini、Claude和GPT系列的模型在发现学生代码中的误解方面非常有效。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的方法能够有效挖掘学生编程中的误解，为编程教育提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件调试技术在游戏开发中应用有限，游戏开发需要独特的调试技术如屏幕控制台、调试绘制、调试相机等，但缺乏对这些技术实际使用情况的系统研究。

Method: 记录游戏工作室中20名资深开发者在处理关键bug（崩溃、对象行为、对象持久化）时的调试会话，进行主题分析。

Result: 游戏开发者36.6%时间用于检查游戏构件，35.1%时间用于本地复现bug；识别了调试瓶颈活动和使用的工具，以及不同专业角色在调试中的协作模式。

Conclusion: 技术角色在调试中处于核心地位，游戏开发需要专门的调试工具和方法来应对构件检查和bug复现这两个主要时间消耗环节。

Abstract: Conventional debugging techniques used in traditional software are similarly
used when debugging video games. However, the reality of video games require
its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug
Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this
article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned
industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments
rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs
categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this
paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug
resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging
techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during
debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic
analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting
game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM微调的文件路径检索方法，通过代码感知策略生成训练数据，在多个Python项目中实现了高精度的文件路径检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码搜索方法缺乏语义上下文和跨文件链接理解，而大语言模型虽然理解自然语言但缺乏仓库特定细节，需要一种能够结合两者优势的代码文件检索方法。

Method: 使用QLoRA和Unsloth优化对Qwen3-8B模型进行微调，通过六种基于AST结构和仓库内容的代码感知策略生成训练数据，包括单文件提示到分层仓库摘要等多种方法。

Result: 在Flask、Click、Jinja、FastAPI和PyTorch等Python项目上获得高达91%的精确匹配率和93%的召回率，在PyTorch大型代码库（约4000个Python文件）上达到59%的召回率。

Conclusion: 多级代码信号有助于LLM推理跨文件上下文，该方法展示了良好的可扩展性，未来可进一步整合检索与基于LLM的代码智能。

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find
the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature
work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or
IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large
language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific
detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong
LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file
paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we
introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST)
structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs,
where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file
prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine
tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch,
and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on
held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase
like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing
scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over
cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context
length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based
code intelligence.

Abstract: We present a repository decomposition system that converts large software
repositories into a vectorized knowledge graph which mirrors project
architectural and semantic structure, capturing semantic relationships and
allowing a significant level of automatization of further repository
development. The graph encodes syntactic relations such as containment,
implementation, references, calls, and inheritance, and augments nodes with
LLM-derived summaries and vector embeddings. A hybrid retrieval pipeline
combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based
assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces
human-oriented explanations.

Motivation: 现有可持续性方法多为高层指南，实施耗时且依赖团队适应性，且主要集中在设计或实现阶段，而可持续性评估应从需求工程阶段开始。

Method: SEER框架分三个阶段：从通用分类法中识别特定软件产品的可持续性需求；基于识别的需求评估系统需求的可持续性；优化未能满足可持续性需求的系统需求。使用LLM推理和RAG方法实现。

Result: 在四个不同领域的软件项目上实验，使用Gemini 2.5推理模型，结果显示该方法能准确识别跨领域的广泛可持续性问题。

Conclusion: SEER框架在软件开发的早期阶段有效解决了可持续性问题，能够准确识别和优化可持续性需求。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental,
technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable
practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are
time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus
on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at
the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a
framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software
development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies
sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from
a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are
based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that
fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning
capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from
different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately
identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

Result: 提出了涵盖四个维度的可持续性需求综合分类法，包含明确定义、相关指标和度量方法，并构建了跨维度类别的相关性矩阵。

Conclusion: 该分类法为软件开发者和研究人员提供了有效制定、管理和协调可持续软件开发中权衡的系统化参考框架。

Abstract: Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability
concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors
be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase.
Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs),
these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or
limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a
unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To
address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art.
The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four
dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic).
For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics,
and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the
positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories
across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software
developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and
reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.

Motivation: 当前基于GitHub问题的基准测试无法准确反映开发者与IDE中聊天式编码助手的真实交互方式，导致对代理能力的高估。

Method: 通过分析开发者与聊天式代理的交互模式，将现有正式基准转换为真实用户查询的测试框架。

Result: 应用该框架后发现，现有基准显著高估了代理能力，公开基准高估超过50%，内部基准高估10-16%。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过基准变异技术建立了评估交互式聊天式软件工程代理的新范式。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as
SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to
accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in
integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads
to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios,
especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that
transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through
systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents.
Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks.
In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the
TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and
transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries
based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our
findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent
capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public
benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new
paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents
through benchmark mutation techniques.

Motivation: LLMs在处理超出上下文窗口的长源代码时翻译不准确，需要解决长代码翻译的效率和成本问题

Method: 使用标识符替换技术，将用户给定的长标识符替换为通用占位符，让LLM专注于代码逻辑结构

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能保留语法和层次结构信息，并产生token数量减少的翻译结果

Conclusion: 提出的标识符替换方法有效提高了长代码翻译的效率和成本效益

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate
tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language
is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs
often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window,
which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel
zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By
substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during
translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the
code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical
information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

Abstract: Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern
software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly
integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle.
Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of
how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive
their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a
global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are
utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report
benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster
learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited
context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as
assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet
practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early,
practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key
considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.

Motivation: 随着计算机系统日益庞大复杂，系统专家向新手解释程序如何工作变得至关重要。现有的代码内注释缺乏全局上下文，而设计文档又缺乏与代码的具体连接。

Method: 开发了TReX工具，能够创建交互式、可视化的文学化追踪，这些追踪通过构造保证与程序语义一致。

Result: 已使用TReX为大型系统软件（包括Linux内核、Git源代码控制系统和GCC编译器）的组件编写了文学化追踪文档。

Conclusion: 文学化追踪通过具体执行追踪补充了代码注释和设计文档的不足，为程序理解提供了更有效的文档方法。

Abstract: As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, a crucial task in
software development is for one person (the system expert) to communicate to
another (the system novice) how a certain program works. This paper reports on
the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call
literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated,
concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both
in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs
(which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX,
our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and
guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have
used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems
software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC
compiler.

Motivation: 机器学习库如PyTorch和TensorFlow的API有严格的输入约束，涉及张量等复杂数据结构。现有自动化测试工具如Pynguin不了解这些约束，常生成不合规输入，导致测试过早失败和代码覆盖率有限

Method: 提出PynguinML方法，改进Pynguin测试生成器，利用从官方API文档中提取的约束条件来生成符合要求的ML API输入

Result: 在PyTorch和TensorFlow的165个模块上评估，PynguinML相比Pynguin显著提高测试效果，代码覆盖率最高提升63.9%

Conclusion: PynguinML通过利用API约束生成合规输入，能够更彻底地测试机器学习库，显著提高代码覆盖率

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential
for a wide range of modern applications. Ensuring the correctness of ML
libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict
input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated
test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and
often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and
limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from
official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach
that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to
generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and
higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and
TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that
PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %
higher code coverage.

Motivation: 当前数字孪生应用多为器官特异性或孤立数据类型，缺乏统一且隐私保护的基础设施，无法满足个性化慢性护理对多模态数据整合的需求。

Method: 使用OWL 2.0实现本体驱动的患者数字孪生框架，围绕模块化蓝图构建，通过专家研讨会、问卷和真实世界免疫治疗患者试点研究进行迭代优化和验证。

Conclusion: PMDT通过弥合数据碎片化和语义标准化差距，为下一代数字健康生态系统提供了验证基础，推动慢性护理向主动、持续优化和公平管理转变。

Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data
to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current
digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data
types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper
introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in
silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,
behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.
Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports
automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its
ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse
events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively
refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot
study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.
Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and
GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous
data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,
and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By
bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT
provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,
transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and
equitable management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by
supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its
adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict
privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering
(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies
on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated
transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At
its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that
enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning
pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning
architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw
patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving
privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy
study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with
support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy
in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings
suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated
code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,
reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated
source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code
corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two
critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific
features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the
output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic
alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,
resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original
source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured
Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT
consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the
syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic
syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality
fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation
module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and
contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction
tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused
by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs
syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend
structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code
generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code
based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in
code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.
