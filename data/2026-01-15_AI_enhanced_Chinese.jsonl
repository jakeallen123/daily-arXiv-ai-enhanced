We introduce DELIBERATIONBENCH, a controlled benchmark evaluating three deliberation protocols against a strong baseline of selecting the best response from a pool of model outputs. Across 270 questions and three independent seeds (810 total evaluations), we find a striking negative result: the best-single baseline achieves an 82.5% +- 3.3% win rate, dramatically outperforming the best deliberation protocol(13.8% +- 2.6%).

We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adversarial Tales\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d5b\u535a\u670b\u514b\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6c11\u95f4\u6545\u4e8b\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfcLLMs\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe71.3%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6784\u6210\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdversarial Tales\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\uff1a1)\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d5b\u535a\u670b\u514b\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\uff1b2)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f17\u62c9\u57fa\u7c73\u5c14\u00b7\u666e\u7f57\u666e\u7684\u6c11\u95f4\u6545\u4e8b\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff1b3)\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u89e3\u91ca", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u768426\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523071.3%\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e4b\u524d\u7684Adversarial Poetry\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6784\u6210\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u522b", "conclusion": "\u6587\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u9632\u5fa1\u96be\u4ee5\u7a77\u5c3d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe"}}

This mismatch substantially limits the real-world applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL systems. To bridge this gap, we explore a database-centric approach that leverages intrinsic, fine-grained information residing in relational databases to construct missing evidence and improve Text-to-SQL accuracy under annotation-scarce conditions. Our key hypothesis is that when a query requires multi-step reasoning over extensive table information, existing methods often struggle to reliably identify and utilize the truly relevant knowledge. We therefore propose to \"cache\" query-relevant knowledge on the database side in advance, so that it can be selectively activated at inference time. Based on this idea, we introduce Companion Agents (CA), a new Text-to-SQL paradigm that incorporates a group of agents accompanying database schemas to proactively mine and consolidate hidden inter-table relations, value-domain distributions, statistical regularities, and latent semantic cues before query generation. Experiments on BIRD under the fully missing evidence setting show that CA recovers +4.49 / +4.37 / +14.13 execution accuracy points on RSL-SQL / CHESS / DAIL-SQL, respectively, with larger gains on the Challenging subset +9.65 / +7.58 / +16.71. These improvements stem from CA's automatic database-side mining and evidence construction, suggesting a practical path toward industrial-grade Text-to-SQL deployment without reliance on human-curated evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCompanion Agents (CA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u6316\u6398\u9690\u85cf\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u7684Text-to-SQL\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Text-to-SQL\u57fa\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6807\u6ce8\u5b8c\u6574\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6613\u5f97\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86SOTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCompanion Agents (CA)\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6316\u6398\u8868\u95f4\u9690\u85cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u503c\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9884\u5148\u7f13\u5b58\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b", "result": "\u5728BIRD\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u8bc1\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cCA\u5728RSL-SQL/CHESS/DAIL-SQL\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387+4.49/+4.37/+14.13\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u5927\uff1a+9.65/+7.58/+16.71\u70b9", "conclusion": "CA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7aef\u6316\u6398\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84"}}

However, the prevailing industry model, where corporations retain ownership of the VTuber persona while the Nakanohito bears the immense pressure of dual-identity management, exposes the Nakanohito to significant vulnerabilities, including burnout, harassment, and precarious labor conditions. When these pressures become untenable, the Nakanohito may terminate their contracts and later debut with a new persona, a process known as \"reincarnation\". This phenomenon, a rising concern in the industry, inflicts substantial losses on the Nakanohito, agencies, and audiences alike. Understanding the quantitative fallout of reincarnation is crucial for mitigating this damage and fostering a more sustainable industry. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of VTuber reincarnation, analyzing 12 significant cases using a comprehensive dataset of 728K livestream sessions and 4.5B viewer interaction records. Our results suggest reincarnation significantly damages a Nakanohito's career, leading to a decline in audience and financial support, an increase in harassment, and negative repercussions for the wider VTuber industry. Overall, these insights carry immediate implications for mitigating the significant professional and personal costs of the reincarnation, and fostering a healthier and more equitable VTuber ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "VTuber\"\u8f6c\u751f\"\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4eba\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\uff1a\u89c2\u4f17\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u6536\u5165\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u9a9a\u6270\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2aVTuber\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVTuber\u4ea7\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f01\u4e1a\u62e5\u6709\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4eba\u627f\u53d7\u53cc\u91cd\u8eab\u4efd\u7ba1\u7406\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u5026\u6020\u3001\u9a9a\u6270\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u52b3\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f53\u538b\u529b\u8fc7\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u7ea6\u5e76\u4ee5\u65b0\u5f62\u8c61\"\u8f6c\u751f\"\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7ed9\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4eba\u3001\u7ecf\u7eaa\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u89c2\u4f17\u90fd\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5bb3\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76VTuber\u8f6c\u751f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u679012\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b728,000\u4e2a\u76f4\u64ad\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c45\u4ebf\u6761\u89c2\u4f17\u4e92\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8f6c\u751f\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u4e2d\u4e4b\u4eba\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\uff1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c2\u4f17\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u9a9a\u6270\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2aVTuber\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u51cf\u8f7b\u8f6c\u751f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684VTuber\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR", "comment": "technical report", "summary": "Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization.

The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions. These results provide initial empirical evidence that a safety-preserving, humansupervised multi-LLM architecture can achieve stable recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic, publicly deployed environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff09\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6765\u514b\u670d\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210LLM\u3001\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1LLM\u7ec4\u6210\u9012\u5f52\u4ea4\u4e92\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\uff08RKS\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u572847\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u53cd\u5c04\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5f97\u52060.78\u00b10.06\uff0c\u7ea668%\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u22650.8\uff0c\u7ea689%\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6536\u655b\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5728\u590d\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u6536\u7f29\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784LLM\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u7684RKS\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u516c\u5f00\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u591aLLM\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance.

Obtaining the optimal QoS while minimizing resource consumption remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes the streamlined pathway (SP) model, which is a flow scheduling solution that requires minimal statistical knowledge of the DCN data plane. The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement. These results confirm that SP outperforms leading techniques such as Sieve, Hedera, and ECMP, concerning bisection bandwidth, DCN link utilization, packet loss, and packet delivery latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSDN\u7684\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u578bSP\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u7aef\u53e3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u80d6\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edcQoS\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548cQoS\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18QoS\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u7ebf\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff08SP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSDN\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u6536\u96c6\u6700\u5c11\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u7aef\u53e3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u80d6\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfECMP\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cSP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5305\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSieve\u3001Hedera\u548cECMP\u7b49\u9886\u5148\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86QoS\u3002", "conclusion": "SP\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728SDN\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684QoS\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Pan"], "title": "Consistency-Aware Editing for Entity-level Unlearning in Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts.

We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning.

Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions.

These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.\n  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy.

In a UAV-CPN, a UAV functions as a dynamic relay, outsourcing computing tasks from the request zone to an expanded service zone with diverse computing nodes, including vehicle onboard units, edge servers, and dedicated powerful nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks and overcome the \"island effect\" observed in multi-access edge computing. A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing. We further enhance UAV-CPN performance under a hybrid energy architecture by jointly optimizing UAV altitude and transmit power, where fuel cells and batteries collectively power both UAV propulsion and communication systems. Extensive evaluations show significant performance gains, highlighting the importance of balancing communication and computing capabilities, especially under dual-energy constraints. These findings underscore the potential of UAV-CPNs to significantly boost computing power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f7f\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7f51\u7edc(UAV-CPN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u8bf7\u6c42\u533a\u57df\u5916\u5305\u5230\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f66\u8f86\u5355\u5143\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\"\u5b64\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\"\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u548c\"\u5b64\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u6982\u7387\u6765\u91cf\u5316UAV-CPN\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u5171\u540c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a8\u8fdb\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u7535\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86UAV-CPN\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UAV-CPN\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7ee7\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u5b64\u5c9b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification.

This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "HACHI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5728AI\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7eb3\u5165\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u65f6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ea\u6709\u6781\u5c11\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "HACHI\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2) \u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6982\u5ff5\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u662f\u975e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u900f\u660e\u5730\u5ba1\u67e5\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u521b\u4f24\u6027\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cHACHI\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u65b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ad9\u70b9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HACHI\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff1a\u6307\u5bfcAI\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6539\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6b8b\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc(CRFN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6b8b\u5dee\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u542c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95e8\u63a7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6b8b\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc(CRFN)\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u6b8b\u5dee\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e92\u8865\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6539\u5584\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Replica\u548cMatterport3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCRFN\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CRFN\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6b8b\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness.

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

For such systems to function in interactive settings, models must be able to incorporate externally provided confidence information into their verbal responses. In this work, we test whether instruction-tuned language models preserve this controllability across different interaction modes.\n  Using Llama-3.2-3B on GSM8K, we perform a causal intervention study in which explicit external confidence signals are injected and model compliance is measured under multiple prompt strategies. We find that base models exhibit near-perfect controllability (Spearman rho close to 1.0), while instruction-tuned models display a striking context dependence: they fully comply with external corrections under explicit command prompts (bias approximately 0 percent, rho = 0.93), yet systematically ignore the same signals in natural conversational queries (bias plus 40 percent, rho = 0.04).\n  This behavior is not a capability failure; the model can process the signal, but an emergent property of RLHF optimization that prioritizes conversational fluency over external calibration cues in natural dialogue. We further show that internal token-level confidence in small models is uninformative (r = 0.035), underscoring the necessity of external supervision. Our findings highlight a deployment-critical failure mode: the interaction style users expect is precisely where safety corrections are least effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u9075\u4ece\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.2-3B\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1a\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u9075\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5ffd\u7565\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662fRLHF\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5916\u90e8\u6821\u51c6\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u98ce\u683c\u6b63\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u6b63\u6700\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002"}}

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.", "AI": {"tldr": "ForensicFormer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u7edf\u4e00\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523086.8%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53d6\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5df2\u5931\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8303\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e75%\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6ForensicFormer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u7edf\u4e00\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u4f4e\u5c42\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e2d\u5c42\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u56fe\u50cf\u53d6\u8bc1\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523086.8%\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4f20\u7edf\u7be1\u6539\u3001GAN\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5bf9JPEG\u538b\u7f29\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08Q=70\u65f683%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f2a\u9020\u5b9a\u4f4dF1\u5206\u65700.76\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e4-10%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ForensicFormer\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u56fe\u50cf\u53d6\u8bc1\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7be1\u6539\u6280\u672f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53d6\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our \"Trust Curve\" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions.

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "DScheLLM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5feb\u901f-\u6162\u901f\uff09\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u5de5\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u610f\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u63d2\u5165\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDScheLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u534e\u4e3aOpenPangu Embedded-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6162\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8f93\u5165", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u65e9\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET", "summary": "Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This \"write once, run anywhere\" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAviationLMM\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6c11\u822a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6c11\u822a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6848\u5b64\u7acb\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c11\u822a\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6c11\u822a\u9886\u57df\u5448\u73b0\u5b64\u5c9b\u5316\u548c\u7a84\u5316\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u548c\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAviationLMM\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7a7a-\u5730\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u673a\u8f7d\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7075\u6d3b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6001\u52bf\u6458\u8981\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8b66\u62a5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AviationLMM\u7684\u613f\u666f\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9610\u8ff0AviationLMM\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6c11\u822a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u5171\u540c\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6c11\u822aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage.

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines.

At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains.

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential.

While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u59a5\u534f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u4ecd\u662f\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u611f\u77e5\u5168\u5c40\u4efb\u52a1\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6839\u672c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165MoE\u8def\u7531\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u5982\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u8981\u6c42\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5185\u90e8\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165MoE\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u8def\u7531\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faForeman\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u62a4\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4bXZ Utils\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6076\u610f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u4ef6", "motivation": "C\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5305\u542bC\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u5982\u7f16\u8bd1\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6253\u5305\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6280\u672f\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u5206\u6790\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3002XZ Utils\u548cSolarWinds\u653b\u51fb\u8868\u660e\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8584\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u6295\u6bd2\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u6613\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6743\u9650\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177Foreman\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u9650\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "Foreman\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8b66\u544a\u4e86XZ Utils\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u5e94\u50cf\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4e00\u6837\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not.

Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's \"privacy mind\", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios.

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests.

Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning. This work highlights the value of integrating vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory.

While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5149\u523b\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u4e0d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u96f6\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b(2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u7ec3\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1b(3) \u5c11\u6837\u672c\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5149\u523b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99-100%\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u752820\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5c06\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u6574\u5408\u523092%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4ec5\u75285\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u8fbe\u523096.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e25\u91cd\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u8fdb\u884c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS.

However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive \"correct\" or \"incorrect\") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness).

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency.

However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems.

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer.

This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thermo-LIO\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387LiDAR\u7684\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u70ed\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u867d\u6709\u7528\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5730\u4e0b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u548cLiDAR\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u5c06\u8be5\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eLiDAR\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08LIO\uff09\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6865\u6881\u548c\u5385\u5802\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cThermo-LIO\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u70ed\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "Thermo-LIO\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u571f\u6728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DepRadar\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u7f3a\u9677\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5e93\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7f3a\u9677\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0b\u6e38\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\uff08\u5982Transformers\u548cMegatron\uff09\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u4ece\u9759\u9ed8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u4e0b\u6e38\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u9677\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u914d\u7f6e\u6807\u5fd7\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u3001\u95f4\u63a5API\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u3002", "method": "DepRadar\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) PR\u6316\u6398\u5668\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u5668\u4ece\u63d0\u4ea4\u6216\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u534f\u8c03\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b3) \u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0b\u6e38\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u89e6\u53d1\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548cDL\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027DL\u5e93\u7684157\u4e2aPR\u548c70\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523090%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b57\u6bb5\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5b57\u6bb5\u5f97\u52061.6\uff09\u3002\u5728122\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0a\uff0cDepRadar\u8bc6\u522b\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523080%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DepRadar\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points.

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint.

While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u5e93\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027", "method": "RISER\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u539f\u8bed", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRISER\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f973.4-6.5%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5177\u67092-3\u500d\u7684token\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u589e\u76ca", "conclusion": "RISER\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411"}}

Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u56e2\u805a\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7126\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8c\u7ef4\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6676\u4f53\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5047\u56e2\u805a\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u6676\u4f53\u56e2\u805a\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u4e8c\u7ef4\u663e\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u4f3c\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5047\u56e2\u805a\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u666f\u6df1\u6d45\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6e05\u6670\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u6784\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u56e2\u805a", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u91cf\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u70b9\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b2\u7c7b\u7126\u70b9\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7126\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\uff09\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u6c34\u5e73\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u56e2\u805a\u5206\u7c7b", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u6c2f\u9178\u94f5\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u7cd6\u6676\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e2\u805a\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7126\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u56e2\u805a\u548c\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u6676\u4f53\u91cd\u53e0\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5047\u56e2\u805a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6676\u4f53\u56e2\u805a\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $\u03b4$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $\u03b4$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines.

Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \\textit{observable} and \\textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning. We instantiate \\texttt{ITP} with both training-free and reinforcement-trained variants. Extensive experiments across representative agent benchmarks demonstrate that \\texttt{ITP} significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u53d7\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u8d28\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002\u867d\u7136\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5728\u5206\u6790\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u75be\u75c5\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8bef\u8bca\u4ecd\u7136\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u4f53\u6a21\uff08Bakic\u548cXCAT\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4e73\u817a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u7684\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6ce8\u89c6\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5931\u8d25\u5360\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u53d7\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5256\u566a\u58f0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5bf9\u6bdb\u523a\u72b6\u75c5\u7076\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u6839\u636e\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u8bca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation.

A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all \"10 choose k\" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B).

However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation.

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5757\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8868\u793a\u53d1\u5c55\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u9700\u8981\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u5757\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83BWSSL\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5757\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5212\u5206\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u3001\u5757\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5757\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5757\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u65e9\u66b4\u9732\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5757\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u5e76\u5728\u66f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6c60\u5316\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5757\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u671f\u5757\u9971\u548c\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5757\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8868\u793a\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0LLM\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\u7248\u672c\u8f83\u65e7\u3002\u968f\u7740LLM\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u65b0LLM\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff08HITS\u3001SymPrompt\u3001TestSpark\u3001CoverUp\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u65b0LLM\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728393\u4e2a\u7c7b\u548c3,657\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u534717.72%\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u534719.80%\uff0c\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534720.92%\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u5e94\u7528\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0LLM\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u8d85\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\u7684LLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002"}}

To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels.

Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks.

In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShortCoder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u5230\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u751f\u6210\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa10\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u4fdd\u6301\u8f6c\u6362\u7684Python\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b018.1%\u7684token\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6539\u5199\u548cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u521b\u5efaShorterCodeBench\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u57fa\u7840LLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cShortCoder\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad818.1%-37.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ShortCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness.

The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks.

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods.

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7740\u8272\u65f6\u95f4Petri\u7f51\u548c\u53ef\u5c4f\u853d\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001JSSP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u610f\u5916\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7740\u8272\u65f6\u95f4Petri\u7f51\u8868\u793a\u8c03\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\uff0cMaskable Proximal Policy Optimization\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\uff0cGamma\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5230\u8fbe\uff0cWeibull\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c4f\u853d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001JSSP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5236\u9020\u5468\u671f\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Petri\u7f51\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684Petri\u7f51\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning.

In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed).

While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM-Aug\uff1a\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u67095%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u5730\u533a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5236\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAM-Aug\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u4e91\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528SAM\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u540c\u4e00SAM\u884d\u751f\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e27\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PASTIS-R\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76845%\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSAM-Aug\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5mIoU\u8fbe\u523036.21%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.33\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb6.89%\uff09\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u5272\uff08seed=42\uff09\u8fbe\u523040.28% mIoU\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca11.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9065\u611f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang.

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench.

Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faslow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLN\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u96c6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u7684\uff0c\u5145\u6ee1\u5404\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6cdb\u5316\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6cdb\u5316\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faslow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u79ef\u7d2f\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u6790\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u53cd\u601d\u63d0\u53d6\u589e\u5f3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5feb\u6162\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684slow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLN\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the \"curse of two-hop reasoning\" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm.

Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoFSM\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSM\uff09\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoFSM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7684Flow\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7684Skill\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u9650\u64cd\u4f5c\u96c6\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eEvoFSM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728DeepSearch\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523058.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoFSM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757(CMRM)\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\"\u6062\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\"\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f66\u724c\u5b57\u7b26\u5e8f\u5217(\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f)\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757(CMRM)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b57\u7b26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6062\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher.

To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment.

We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\\% in $S_\u03b1$, +0.86\\% in IOU, and +1.77\\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline.

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data.

Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \\textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains.

While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative.

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2).

This model goes beyond Korean text processing by integrating the values, reasoning patterns, and commonsense knowledge inherent to Korean society, enabling nuanced understanding of cultural contexts, emotional subtleties, and real-world scenarios to generate reliable and culturally appropriate responses. To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use. By offering accessible and high-performance Korea-centric LLMs, KT aims to accelerate AI adoption across Korean industries, public services, and education, strengthen the Korean AI developer community, and lay the groundwork for the broader vision of K-intelligence.

To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization.

However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm.

This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u5fae\u5999\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u8c61\u6389\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u968f\u7740LLM\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7acb\u573a\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e3b\u5f20\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u8981\u6c42\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u81ea\u7136\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728CURE-TSR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30Snow\u548cRain\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5e72\u6270\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eVanilla\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cAugMix\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u4ee5T\u500d\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u5f02\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance.

While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability.

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive).

While existing benchmarks have highlighted this weakness through basic character operations, such failures are often dismissed due to lacking practical relevance. Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning.

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy.

This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines.

We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead.

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity.

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaGKD\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9NBI-WLI\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347WLI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u767d\u5149\u6210\u50cf\uff08WLI\uff09\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u50cf\uff08NBI\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u7684NBI-WLI\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPaGKD\uff08Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u7ec4\u7ea7\u539f\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Pro\uff09\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u75c5\u7076\u611f\u77e5\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u539f\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5bc6\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Den\uff09\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ec4\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u534f\u540c\u786e\u4fdd\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPaGKD\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9AUC\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u4e3a3.3%\u30011.1%\u30012.8%\u548c3.2%\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "PaGKD\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WLI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $\u0394W = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $\u0394W = B\u03a3A^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold).

While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling.

However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting.

We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.\n  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity.

However, current methods exhibit two issues. They rely on static and context-unaware profiles, necessitating extensive manual redesign for new scenarios, thus limiting generalizability. Moreover, they neglect human strategic thinking, leading to vulnerability to agent manipulation. To address these issues, we propose UserLM-R1, a novel user language model with reasoning capability.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations. We also contribute a novel benchmark dataset featuring expert qualitative annotations and multi-label scores.

To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices.

However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.\n  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.\n  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.\n  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.\n  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u7535\u8868\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u7535\u8868\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u88c2\u7eb9\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528DreamBooth\u98ce\u683c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7535\u8868\u7ed3\u6784\u7eb9\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2) \u51e0\u4f55\u88c2\u7eb9\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5757\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u5c5e\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\uff1b3) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aFID\u964d\u4f4e32.7%\uff0c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u6e38\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668mAP\u63d0\u534715.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations.

However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReGraM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u5e76\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u8bc1\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6269\u5927\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "ReGraM\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2) \u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\"\u6240\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\u540c\u7b49\u6709\u7528\"\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReGraM\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf(KGARevion)\uff1aMCQ\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53478.04%\uff0cSAQ\u63d0\u53474.50%\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e42.9%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u8df3\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002"}}

While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats.

While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector.

One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6c7d\u8f66\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5728GPS\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7d27\u51d1\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u802616\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7684\u5ba4\u5185VPR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e5f\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5f15\u5bfcVAE\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use.

In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model.

While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems.

Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models.

Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3ICT\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\uff08DICModel\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u75287B\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8632B\u53c2\u6570\u7684SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ICT\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528LLM\u6216\u6784\u5efa\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528Mermaid\u5de5\u5177\u548cLLMs\u5408\u6210\u7ea67K\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2\uff09ICT\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7ea62K\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\u548cLLMs\u8054\u5408\u5408\u6210\u7ea61.5K\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u4ec57B\u53c2\u6570\u7684DICModel\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed632B\u53c2\u6570\u7684SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd47B\u548c32B\u53c2\u6570\u7684SOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0cBLEU\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea656.8%\u548c20.8%\u3002\u5728ICT\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cDICModel\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4Qwen2.5-VL 32B\u9ad81%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdbICT\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "BabyLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578bBERT\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4ece500+GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u81f330\u5c0f\u65f6\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6216\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BabyLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u53d8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7d27\u51d1BERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83BabyLMs\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6BERT\u7684\u5185\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "BabyLMs\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6BERT\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u5148\u524d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "BabyLMs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u52a0\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u3002"}}

Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions.

However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fed\u4ee3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u7c7b\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u4e3a\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u9488\u5bf9\u8c13\u8bcd-\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8c13\u8bcd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios.

For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCAP\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u526a\u679d\u901a\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\uff1a\u5c06\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u90e8\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u9053\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u5e7f\u64ad\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u9053\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u865a\u90e8\u3002\u5c06\u590d\u6570\u573a\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u9891\u57df\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u89c6\u4e3a\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VGG16\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c0.6\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f9790.11%\u7684FLOP\u51cf\u5c11\u548c96.30%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.67%\uff08\u4ece93.44%\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity.

This is the authors' final accepted manuscript", "summary": "With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods.

A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily.

Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MXFP\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MXFP8\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u635f\uff0cMXFP4\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u683c\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u7f29\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MXFP\u5df2\u6210\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u5728MXFP\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76MXFP\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684PTQ\uff0c\u6db5\u76d67\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e0aPTQ\u7b97\u6cd5\u300115\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c3\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u683c\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "1) MXFP8\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u635f\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMXFP4\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2) PTQ\u6548\u679c\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u683c\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b3) \u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u7f29\u653e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584MXFP4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5c06\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u5230MXFP\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MXFP\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u505c\u6ede\u6307\u6570\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u76d1\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u505c\u6ede\u6a21\u5f0f", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u6765\u76d1\u63a7\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f55\u65f6\u63d0\u95ee\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u6548", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a1) \u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b2) \u505c\u6ede\u6307\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u590d\u7c7b\u522b\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6551\u63f4\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06DT\u4fe1\u53f7\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "DT\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u505c\u6ede\u5e26\u6765\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u56e0\u679c\u8bca\u65ad\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u76d1\u63a7"}}

Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant \"Reasoning Gap\": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought.

Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k.

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

In this work, we perform the largest semantic tagging evaluation of the rule based system that uses the lexical resources in the USAS framework covering five different languages using four existing datasets and one novel Chinese dataset. We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model. The resulting neural network models, including the data they were trained on, the Chinese evaluation dataset, and all of the code have been released as open resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9USAS\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u94f6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u8bcd\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\u5728WordNet\u3001BabelNet\u7b49\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46USAS\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1) \u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684USAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e94\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efa\u82f1\u8bed\u94f6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4) \u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u8bed/\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b5) \u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "1) \u5b8c\u6210\u4e86USAS\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u94f6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4) \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b5) \u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u5747\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86USAS\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-DPM\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u548c4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728VGGT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u65743D\u8fd0\u52a8\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\uff08DPMs\uff09\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002DPMs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u66f4\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1DPMs\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4fbf\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u7528\uff1b2) \u5728VGGT\uff08\u5f3a\u5927\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff09\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u4e3aV-DPM\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u548c4D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4VGGT\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u5982P3\uff0cV-DPM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "V-DPM\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u8fd0\u52a8\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86DPMs\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRGD\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8def\u7531\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67e5\u8be2-\u7b54\u6848\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684CASCAL\u67e5\u8be2\u4e13\u7528\u8def\u7531\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u6784\u4e14\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRGD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u67e5\u8be2-\u7b54\u6848\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e13\u7528\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCASCAL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u6295\u7968\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c12\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u67e5\u8be2-\u7b54\u6848\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5668\u9700\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u81ea\u8eab\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u8db3\u591f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bCASCAL\u5728\u5f31\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u67e5\u8be2-\u7b54\u6848\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad84.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "RGD\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e13\u7528\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6bd4\u67e5\u8be2-\u7b54\u6848\u8def\u7531\u5668\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1bCASCAL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u6295\u7968\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation.

Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5(BMM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u5206\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5(BMM)\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6811\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cBMM\u5339\u914d\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6a21\u5f0f\u6784\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002BMM\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b49UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "BMM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aUDA\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths.

Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion.

Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES).

Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cfIDEM\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ICP\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e91\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08IDEM\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0eRMSE\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cIDEM\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u800cRMSE\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u57fa\u5ea6\u91cfIDEM\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations.

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures.

Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization.

We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRENDER\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u30013D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u89c6\u9891\u9700\u8981\u51e0\u5206\u949fGPU\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5177\u8eabAI\u548cVR/AR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff1b4\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "SRENDER\u5728\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u3002", "conclusion": "SRENDER\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u5206\u644a\u5230\u6570\u767e\u5e27\u4e2d\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "COMPOSE\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f53\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u4f20\u64ad\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\u534f\u8c03\u53d8\u5f97\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe23%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe11%\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0cCOMPOSE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
