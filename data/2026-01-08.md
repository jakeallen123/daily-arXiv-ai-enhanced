Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于超类型-子类型概念层次结构的群体概念擦除方法SuPLoRA，通过共享参数高效擦除多个相关概念，同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型概念擦除方法在处理多个概念时效率低下且效果不佳，每个概念需要单独参数集，且会降低整体生成质量

Method: 构建超类型-子类型概念层次结构，将语义相关概念分组；提出SuPLoRA方法，在冻结的下投影矩阵中编码超类型信息，仅更新上投影矩阵进行擦除

Result: 构建了更具挑战性的基准测试，涵盖名人、物体和色情内容等多个领域的概念同时擦除；理论分析证明了SuPLoRA在缓解生成性能退化方面的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的超类型-子类型层次结构和SuPLoRA方法能够高效、有效地擦除多个相关概念，同时保持扩散模型的整体生成能力

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM4VLA框架揭示：VLM通用能力不能预测下游VLA策略性能，视觉模块是主要瓶颈，控制相关监督能提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLM选择与能力如何影响下游VLA策略性能，挑战当前关于VLM能力直接转化为控制性能的假设

Method: 提出VLM4VLA最小适应管道，仅使用少量可学习参数将通用VLM转换为VLA策略，进行公平高效比较

Result: VLM初始化始终优于从头训练，但VLM通用能力不能预测下游性能；视觉模块是主要瓶颈；控制相关监督能提升性能

Conclusion: 当前VLM预训练目标与具身行动规划需求存在持续领域差距，需要针对性的视觉监督来弥合这一差距

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的白虾自动分类系统，利用CNN模型替代人工分拣，提高分选准确率和效率，保持虾类新鲜度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息技术融入水产养殖，生产日益稳定增长。消费者对高品质水产品需求上升，新鲜度和外观完整性成为关键关注点。虾类加工食品中，新鲜度在收获后迅速下降，软壳虾在烹饪或冷冻后常出现头身分离，影响产品外观和消费者感知。

Method: 利用基于深度学习的图像识别技术，采用卷积神经网络（CNN）模型对收获后的白虾进行自动分类，替代传统人工分拣方法。

Result: CNN模型提高了分类的准确性、效率和一致性，减少了处理时间，有助于保持虾类新鲜度，使虾类运输企业能更有效地满足客户需求。

Conclusion: 深度学习图像识别技术能够有效解决虾类加工中的新鲜度保持和外观完整性问题，通过自动化分类提升水产加工效率和质量控制。

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [6] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用高阶张量（三阶及以上）扩展PCA的协方差矩阵，以更精确描述复杂形状，并推导旋转不变特征，用于分子形状描述、物体识别和形状相似性度量等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA使用协方差矩阵（二阶张量）只能将形状近似为椭球体，而真实形状通常更复杂，需要更高阶的描述方法。

Method: 扩展PCA到高阶张量：如三阶张量p_abc=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]描述中心矩，或使用多项式乘以高斯函数，构建可解码的高精度形状描述符及其旋转不变特征。

Result: 该方法能生成任意高精度的形状描述符，提供旋转不变特征，可用于形状模旋转的描述和比较。

Conclusion: 高阶张量扩展为复杂形状分析提供了更强大的工具，在分子形状描述、旋转不变物体识别和形状相似性度量等领域有重要应用价值，避免了昂贵的旋转优化计算。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMErroR是一个多模态基准测试，包含2013个包含单一连贯推理错误的样本，用于评估视觉语言模型检测错误推理和分类错误类型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态学习中的进步，需要评估这些模型是否真正理解处理的内容，特别是能否检测推理过程中的错误并识别错误类型。

Method: 构建MMErroR基准测试，包含2013个样本，每个样本嵌入一个单一连贯推理错误，涵盖6个顶级领域下的24个子领域，进行过程级、以错误为中心的评估。

Result: 评估了20个先进视觉语言模型，即使最佳模型(Gemini-3.0-Pro)也只能在66.47%的情况下正确分类错误，表明识别错误推理具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 准确识别错误的能力为多模态推理模型的能力提供了有价值的见解，MMErroR基准测试揭示了当前模型在检测错误推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的可重光照3D高斯人头模型，能够从单张或多张图像重建可重光照的3D头像，无需复杂的OLAT照明数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量重光照方法需要复杂的时序多路照明数据（如OLAT），限制了应用范围。需要一种能从普通图像重建可重光照头像的通用方法。

Method: 采用两阶段设计：第一阶段在无OLAT的多样化数据集上学习平光照3D高斯头像；第二阶段在小型OLAT数据集上学习从平光照头像到物理反射参数的映射，实现高质量重光照。

Result: 该方法能够从单张或多张图像重建可重光照头像，实现新颖视角合成和重光照，且泛化能力强，无需为每个主体采集OLAT数据。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段模型成功解决了从普通图像重建可重光照3D头像的难题，为数字头像应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

Motivation: 自然界和计算机生成图像中常见的软边界（如细发）在3D视觉中具有挑战性，因为前景和背景线索的模糊混合难以处理。

Method: 1) 利用图像抠图数据集的数据整理流程；2) 深度修复网络自动识别软边界区域，通过门控残差模块精确细化深度；3) 基于深度的前向扭曲保留高保真纹理；4) 生成式场景绘制器填充遮挡区域并消除软边界内的冗余背景伪影；5) 颜色融合器自适应结合扭曲和修复结果。

Conclusion: HairGuard框架能够有效恢复3D视觉任务中的细粒度软边界细节，通过创新的深度修复和生成式场景绘制技术，在多个任务中取得优异表现。

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

### [10] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了RiskCueBench视频风险预测基准，要求模型从风险信号片段（而非完整视频）预测潜在危险事件，揭示了现有系统在早期风险识别上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风险评估研究通常让模型访问包含事故本身的完整视频序列，这大大降低了任务难度，无法反映真实世界条件。需要建立更贴近实际应用的基准来评估模型从早期视觉信号预测风险的能力。

Method: 引入RiskCueBench视频理解基准，通过精心标注识别风险信号片段——即指示潜在安全担忧的最早时刻，要求模型基于这些早期信号预测未来风险事件。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前系统在理解动态演变情境和从早期视觉信号预测未来风险事件方面存在显著能力差距，突显了视频风险预测模型实际部署的重要挑战。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench基准揭示了现有视频风险预测系统在早期风险识别方面的不足，为开发更实用的视频风险评估模型提供了重要基准和挑战方向。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

### [11] [A Novel Unified Approach to Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03382)
*Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合空间域和频域特征交叉注意力以及血液检测模块的深度伪造检测架构，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，深度伪造的合成和滥用威胁日益严重，为维护数字时代的信任，需要有效的深度伪造检测和标记方法

Method: 提出新颖架构，使用空间域和频域特征的交叉注意力机制，结合血液检测模块，采用Swin Transformer/BERT或EfficientNet-B4/BERT组合进行分类

Result: 在FF++数据集上达到99.80% AUC，Celeb-DF数据集上达到99.88% AUC（使用Swin Transformer和BERT）；使用EfficientNet-B4和BERT时分别达到99.55%和99.38% AUC，跨数据集泛化性能优秀

Conclusion: 提出的统一架构在深度伪造检测任务中超越了现有最佳方法，提供了有效的检测方案，并展示了良好的泛化能力

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

### [12] [Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了猕猴下颞叶皮层在观看自然视频时的神经响应与不同ANN模型的预测能力，发现当前视频模型主要捕捉外观相关的动态特征，而非IT皮层表现的外观不变性时间计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然前馈人工神经网络是灵长类腹侧视觉流的主流模型，但它们本质上是静态计算模型。灵长类世界是动态的，猕猴下颞叶皮层不仅支持物体识别，还在自然视频观看中编码物体运动速度。需要探究IT的时间响应是否反映了超越逐帧特征的更丰富动态计算。

Method: 通过比较猕猴IT在观看自然视频时的神经响应与静态、循环和基于视频的ANN模型的预测能力。应用"压力测试"：在保留运动但移除形状和纹理的"外观无关"变体视频上评估解码器的泛化能力。

Result: 视频模型在神经预测性方面提供了适度改进，特别是在后期响应阶段。IT群体活动在"外观无关"操作中表现出良好的泛化能力，但所有ANN类别都失败了。这表明当前视频模型主要捕捉外观相关的动态特征。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型更好地捕捉外观相关的动态特征，而非IT皮层表达的外观不变性时间计算。这强调了需要新的目标函数来编码生物时间统计特性和不变性。

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eye-Q是一个多语言视觉文字谜题基准测试，旨在评估视觉语言模型的深层推理能力，而非表面识别。该基准包含1343个需要从密集场景中推断目标词或短语的谜题，结果显示当前最先进模型的最大准确率仅为60.27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但往往依赖表面识别而非深层推理。现有基准存在字面理解、OCR捷径和简单检索匹配等局限性，需要更具挑战性的测试来评估模型的复杂视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出Eye-Q多语言基准测试，包含1343个视觉文字谜题。这些谜题具有概念密集的场景和简短描述，需要推断特定目标词或短语。谜题故意设计为非结构化和线索隐含，包含干扰项和上下文关系，要求选择性注意、抽象和关联推理。基准涵盖英语、波斯语、阿拉伯语和跨语言谜题。

Result: 评估最先进的视觉语言模型，使用开放式、人类对齐的协议来探测假设形成和修订。结果显示显著的性能差距，特别是在抽象和跨语言谜题上。最大准确率仅为60.27%，突显当前模型在构建和搜索适当概念表示以进行灵活图像到短语推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 视觉文字谜题是评估视觉语言模型深层推理能力的有效工具。Eye-Q基准揭示了当前模型在复杂视觉理解方面的局限性，特别是在抽象推理和跨语言场景中。这为未来研究提供了重要方向，需要开发能够进行假设形成、修订和概念搜索的更强大模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型的安全对齐在对抗性输入下仍然脆弱，传统攻击方法主要增加视觉任务复杂度，未能充分利用模型的推理激励机制，导致在推理模型上效果不佳

Method: 提出GAMBIT框架：1)分解和重组有害视觉语义；2)构建游戏化场景驱动模型探索和重构意图；3)将模型定位为参与者，通过追求游戏目标来降低安全注意力；4)诱导模型回答重构后的恶意查询

Result: 在流行的推理和非推理MLLMs上实现高攻击成功率：Gemini 2.5 Flash达到92.13%，QvQ-MAX达到91.20%，GPT-4o达到85.87%，显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 通过利用模型的推理激励机制构建游戏化场景，可以有效诱导模型主动完成越狱，这揭示了多模态模型安全对齐的新脆弱性，需要更强大的防御机制

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

TL;DR: FROST-Drive：一种新的端到端自动驾驶架构，通过冻结预训练视觉编码器来保留视觉语言模型的泛化能力，在长尾场景中表现优于完全微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶模型通过完全微调视觉编码器来适应驾驶任务，但这可能导致模型过度专业化于训练数据，限制了其在新颖复杂场景中的泛化能力。本文质疑这种训练范式的必要性，旨在探索如何更好地利用预训练视觉语言模型的广泛世界知识。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：1）冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重；2）使用基于transformer的适配器进行多模态融合；3）采用基于GRU的解码器生成平滑路径点；4）引入专门优化Rater Feedback Score的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（专门设计用于捕捉长尾场景的大规模数据集）上的广泛实验表明，冻结编码器方法显著优于完全微调模型，证明了保留VLM广泛知识是更有效的策略。

Conclusion: 保留强大视觉语言模型的广泛知识比密集的领域特定适应更能实现鲁棒、可泛化的驾驶性能，这为开发能更好处理现实世界应用复杂性的视觉模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Conclusion: SDCD通过解决视觉编码过程中的结构偏差，有效缓解了大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，为多模态理解提供了新思路

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

<details>

Motivation: 传统人体运动预测方法将问题视为序列回归，直接外推关节坐标。这种方法存在三个主要问题：1) 未分离观测重建与动力学建模；2) 缺乏对运动潜在因果的显式表示；3) 导致复合漂移、均值姿态崩溃和不确定性校准不佳

Conclusion: 将人体视为世界模型状态空间的一部分而非其输出，从根本上改变了运动模拟和预测的方式。SBWM通过分离动力学建模与观测重建，为人体运动预测提供了更稳定、可解释的框架

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

### [28] [EASLT: Emotion-Aware Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03549)
*Guobin Tu,Di Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASLT是一个情感感知的手语翻译框架，通过专门的情感编码器捕捉面部表情的连续动态，并使用情感感知融合模块解决手语翻译中的语义歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无标注的手语翻译方法主要关注手动信号，但忽略了面部表情的语义重要性，导致当不同概念具有相同手动表达时产生歧义。

Method: 提出EASLT框架，包含专门的情感编码器捕捉连续情感动态，通过情感感知融合模块自适应地重新校准时空特征，将面部情感作为语义锚点而非辅助信息。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中，EASLT在无标注方法中达到先进性能，分别获得26.15和22.80的BLEU-4分数，以及61.0和57.8的BLEURT分数。

Conclusion: 明确建模情感能有效将情感语义与手动动态解耦，显著提高翻译保真度，面部表情应被视为手语翻译中的核心语义锚点而非辅助信息。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc是一个利用粗到细策略的跨模态定位框架，通过实例级和全局级空间关系，使用文本和点云实现机器人定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态定位使用文本和点云使机器人能够通过自然语言描述进行定位，应用于自主导航和人机交互。由于物体在文本和点云中经常重复出现，空间关系成为最具有区分性的定位线索。

Method: 采用粗到细策略：粗阶段使用Bezier增强对象空间编码器（BEOSE）通过二次贝塞尔曲线建模实例级空间关系，以及频率感知编码器（FAE）在频域生成全局级空间表示；细阶段使用不确定性感知高斯精细定位器（UGFL）通过建模为高斯分布并带有不确定性感知损失函数来回归2D位置。

Result: 在KITTI360Pose数据集上的大量实验表明，SpatiaLoc显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc通过强调空间关系的粗到细策略，在跨模态定位任务中取得了卓越性能，证明了空间关系建模对于文本和点云定位的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略的AI生成图像检测方法，通过纹理感知掩码机制增强CLIP-ViT对生成模型特定模式的识别能力，显著提升对未见生成模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型快速发展，AI生成图像质量显著提升，引发了关于虚假信息和公众信任的担忧。检测AI生成图像成为关键挑战，特别是对未见生成模型的泛化能力。现有方法使用冻结的预训练CLIP模型虽然显示出泛化潜力，但仅将图像编码器作为基本特征提取器，未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略，包含纹理感知掩码（TAM）机制。首先分析冻结CLIP-ViT编码器，发现其能有效聚类真实图像但缺乏区分真实与AI生成图像的能力。TAM在微调过程中掩码包含生成模型特定模式的纹理区域，迫使CLIP-ViT关注真实图像的"分布偏差"来检测AI生成图像。

Result: 在GenImage和UniversalFakeDetect数据集上的大量实验表明，仅使用少量图像进行微调，该方法显著优于现有方法，在两个数据集上分别达到98.2%和94.6%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 通过纹理感知掩码机制微调CLIP-ViT编码器，能够有效提升AI生成图像检测的泛化能力，仅需少量训练数据即可实现对未见生成模型的高精度检测。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiT-Bench是一个评估纯文本大语言模型空间智能的新基准，通过将视觉场景转换为坐标感知的文本描述，测试LLMs在无像素输入下的空间推理能力，发现现有模型存在"空间差距"但具有潜在世界建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间智能研究主要依赖视觉语言模型，但尚不清楚空间理解能力究竟来自视觉编码器还是基础推理架构。本文旨在探究纯文本大语言模型是否具备空间推理能力，并为此创建专门的评估基准。

Method: 提出SiT-Bench基准，包含3,800多个专家标注项目，涵盖5个主要类别和17个子任务。通过将单/多视角场景转换为高保真、坐标感知的文本描述，要求LLMs进行符号文本推理而非视觉模式匹配。

Result: 评估发现：SOTA LLMs在局部语义任务上表现良好，但在全局一致性方面存在显著的"空间差距"。同时发现显式空间推理能显著提升性能，表明LLMs具有潜在的世界建模能力。

Conclusion: SiT-Bench为开发具有空间基础能力的LLM主干提供了重要资源，有助于未来视觉语言模型和具身智能体的发展。研究表明LLMs具备空间推理的潜力，但需要进一步改进以弥合空间差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出环境鲁棒的少样本分割新设定和基准ER-FSS，以及自适应注意力蒸馏方法AAD，在复杂环境条件下提升分割性能3.3%-8.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本分割研究忽视真实世界复杂环境因素（如光照、背景、视角变化），导致实验室训练的模型在实际部署中表现不佳。需要增强模型在动态复杂环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出自适应注意力蒸馏方法AAD，通过反复对比和蒸馏已知支持图像与未知查询图像之间的关键共享语义，推导出新类别的类特定注意力，增强模型在复杂环境中聚焦正确目标的能力。

Result: 建立环境鲁棒少样本分割基准ER-FSS，涵盖8个真实场景数据集。AAD方法在所有数据集和设定下将mIoU提升3.3%-8.5%，表现出优越性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 环境鲁棒少样本分割是实际应用的关键需求，提出的AAD方法通过自适应注意力蒸馏有效增强模型在复杂环境下的分割能力，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对印度石刻铭文的鲁棒自适应分块策略，结合注意力U-Net进行二值化，显著提升性能并展示跨脚本的零样本泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 石刻铭文图像存在对比度差、表面退化不均、干扰伪影多、文本密度和布局变化大等问题，导致现有二值化技术难以提取连贯字符区域

Method: 提出自适应分块策略，通过动态采样和分块选择方法训练注意力U-Net，注意力机制帮助模型聚焦细微结构线索，克服表面噪声和布局不规则性

Result: 新分块机制显著提升二值化性能，在经典和深度学习基线上均有改进；模型在单一印度脚本数据集上训练，却能在其他印度和非印度脚本上展示强大的零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为石刻铭文生成干净、结构化的内容表示，为下游任务（如脚本识别、OCR和历史文本分析）奠定基础，展示了鲁棒性和脚本无关的泛化能力

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 单目3D检测中，深度估计主干网络的选择比特征增强更重要，NeWCRFs在KITTI验证集上表现优于Depth Anything V2，语义特征注入仅带来边际提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D物体检测相比激光雷达成本更低但精度不足，主要挑战在于从单张图像准确估计度量深度。研究旨在系统评估深度主干网络和特征工程对伪激光雷达管道性能的影响。

Method: 在KITTI验证集上对比NeWCRFs（监督度量深度）和Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor（Base）两种深度主干网络，使用相同的伪激光雷达生成和PointRCNN检测协议。测试了点云增强方法，包括外观线索（灰度强度）和语义线索（实例分割置信度），并进行深度精度与距离的诊断分析。

Result: NeWCRFs在中等难度分割上达到10.50% AP₃D（IoU=0.7），表现优于Depth Anything V2。语义特征注入仅带来边际提升，基于掩码的采样甚至会因移除上下文几何而降低性能。深度精度与距离分析显示，粗略深度正确性不能完全预测严格的3D IoU。

Conclusion: 在使用现成的激光雷达检测器时，深度主干网络的选择和几何保真度主导性能，超过了次要特征注入的影响。深度估计质量是单目3D检测的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

Motivation: 现有基于描述性特征的物体分类技术依赖物体对齐来计算相似度，这限制了方法的适用性和效率

Method: 将物体边界归一化并分割为近似凸段，按长度降序排序，提取段长度、极值点数量、面积、基部和宽度等特征袋来测量图像边界相似度

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，观察到可接受的结果

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过特征排序成功替代了物体对齐需求，为物体分类提供了一种有效的替代方案

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 裂纹自动分割在实际部署中面临两大挑战：像素级标注稀缺，以及不同传感器、光照、纹理和标注规范导致的严重域偏移问题。

Method: 提出CrackSegFlow框架，包含两个流匹配模型：1）基于二元掩码生成逼真裂纹图像的生成器，采用拓扑保持掩码注入和边界门控调制技术；2）类别条件流匹配模型生成裂纹掩码，可控制裂纹覆盖率。还将裂纹掩码注入无裂纹背景中以增加多样性。

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Conclusion: VideoMemory通过动态记忆库机制实现了跨远距离镜头的实体一致性，支持连贯的长叙事视频生成，解决了现有模型在实体持续性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能产生高质量美学视频，但难以学习真实世界物理动态的表示，导致物体碰撞不自然、重力不一致、时间闪烁等伪影

Method: 提出PhysVideoGenerator框架，包含轻量级预测器网络PredictorP，从预训练的V-JEPA 2提取高级物理特征，从噪声扩散潜变量回归这些特征，通过交叉注意力机制注入到DiT-based生成器(Latte)的时间注意力层

Result: 证明了联合训练范式的技术可行性：扩散潜变量包含足够信息来恢复V-JEPA 2物理表示，多任务优化在训练过程中保持稳定

Conclusion: 该工作建立了物理感知生成模型未来大规模评估的基础，验证了训练稳定性，记录了架构设计和技术挑战

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

*Dennis Holzmann,Sven Wachsmuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用2D点轨迹作为额外运动线索的自我中心动作识别新方法，通过跟踪随机采样的图像点来提升识别准确率，无需检测手部、物体或交互区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心动作识别方法主要依赖RGB外观、人体姿态估计或其组合，缺乏有效的运动信息表示。本文探索使用2D点轨迹作为轻量级但有效的运动线索来增强动作理解。

Method: 使用CoTracker跟踪每个视频中随机初始化的一组点，将得到的轨迹与对应图像帧一起作为输入，送入基于Transformer的识别模型。特别的是，该方法甚至可以在仅提供初始帧及其关联点轨迹的情况下工作，无需完整视频序列。

Result: 实验结果表明，集成2D点轨迹相比不使用运动信息的相同模型能持续提升性能。令人惊讶的是，即使只使用初始帧和关联的点轨迹（不包含完整视频序列），也能获得显著增益。

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹作为一种轻量级但有效的表示，具有提升自我中心动作理解的潜力。该方法避免了复杂的手部、物体或交互区域检测，通过简单的点跟踪就能获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

TL;DR: 提出BREATH-VL框架，结合视觉语言模型的语义理解与视觉配准的几何信息，用于内窥镜6-DoF相机定位，在复杂气道环境中显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在导航任务中表现优异，但应用于内窥镜6-DoF定位面临三大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量医疗定位数据集、细粒度姿态回归能力有限、时序特征提取计算延迟高。需要结合语义理解与几何配准的优势。

Method: 1) 构建BREATH数据集——目前最大的体内内窥镜定位数据集；2) 提出BREATH-VL混合框架，整合VLM语义线索与视觉配准几何信息；3) 引入轻量级上下文学习机制，将运动历史编码为语言提示，实现高效时序推理。

Result: 视觉语言模块在挑战性手术场景中实现鲁棒语义定位。BREATH-VL在精度和泛化性上均优于最先进的纯视觉定位方法，平移误差比最佳基线降低25.5%，同时保持有竞争力的计算延迟。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力与视觉配准方法的几何精度，BREATH-VL框架有效解决了内窥镜6-DoF定位的挑战，在复杂医疗环境中实现了高精度、高泛化性的相机定位。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Motivation: 主动对准是光学系统大规模自动化组装的关键技术。基于光学仿真的数字孪生管道可生成大规模标注数据，但复杂成像条件导致仿真与真实图像存在域差距，限制了仿真训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出域自适应主动对准(DA3)，采用自回归域变换生成器和基于对抗的特征对齐策略，通过自监督学习提取真实域信息，提取域不变的图像退化特征以实现鲁棒的对准预测。

Result: 在两种镜头类型上的实验显示，DA3比纯仿真管道精度提升46%。接近使用3个镜头样本精确标注真实数据的性能，同时减少98.7%的设备数据收集时间。

Conclusion: 域自适应有效赋予仿真训练模型鲁棒的真实世界性能，验证了数字孪生管道作为显著提升大规模光学组装效率的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

TL;DR: CSMCIR提出统一表示框架解决组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过多级思维链提示、对称双塔架构和动态记忆库实现高效查询-目标对齐，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索方法存在表示空间碎片化问题：查询和目标包含异构模态，由不同编码器处理，迫使模型仅通过事后对齐来桥接未对齐的表示空间，这从根本上限制了检索性能。这种架构不对称在特征空间中表现为三个分离的簇，直接展示了异构模态如何从初始化就创建根本未对齐的表示空间。

Method: 1. 多级思维链提示策略：指导多模态大语言模型为目标图像生成具有区分性且语义兼容的标题，建立模态对称性；2. 对称双塔架构：查询和目标两侧使用相同的共享参数Q-Former进行跨模态编码，确保一致的特征表示；3. 基于熵的时序动态记忆库策略：提供高质量负样本，同时保持与演化模型状态的一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CSMCIR实现了最先进的性能，并具有优越的训练效率。全面的消融研究进一步验证了每个提出组件的有效性。

Conclusion: CSMCIR通过统一表示框架解决了组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过模态对称性、架构对称性和动态负样本策略实现了高效的查询-目标对齐，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略周围环境中的上下文交互，并且未能充分融入海洋生物分类学的层次结构，这限制了细粒度海洋物种分类的准确性。

Method: 提出MATANet模型，包含两个关键组件：多上下文环境注意力模块（MCEAM）学习感兴趣区域与周围环境的关系；层次分离诱导学习模块（HSLM）将分类学层次结构编码到特征空间中。

Result: 在FathomNet2025、FAIR1M和LifeCLEF2015-Fish数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MATANet通过结合实例特征、环境特征和分类学结构，有效提升了细粒度海洋物种分类的准确性，模仿了专家利用分类学和环境上下文解释水下动物模糊特征的策略。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 理解放射学图像集之间的差异对于生成临床见解和解释医学AI系统至关重要。目前缺乏系统的方法和基准来发现放射学数据中有意义的差异。

Method: 基于VisDiff的提议者-排序者框架，结合四个创新：1)通过领域适应的视觉语言模型注入医学知识；2)整合图像与临床报告的多模态推理；3)跨多轮推理的迭代假设细化；4)定位并放大显著区域以捕捉细微发现的目标视觉搜索。

Conclusion: RadDiff和RadDiffBench为系统性地发现放射学数据中有意义的差异提供了首个方法和基准基础，展示了在多种临床任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

<details>

Motivation: RGB图像在颜色纹理模糊的真实场景中检测伪装目标效果不佳，高光谱图像虽能提供精细光谱特征，但缺乏专用大规模基准限制了HCOD研究进展

Method: 提出HyperCOD基准（350张高分辨率高光谱图像），并设计HSC-SAM方法：将高光谱图像解耦为空间图（输入SAM编码器）和光谱显著性图（作为自适应提示），有效桥接模态差异

Result: HSC-SAM在HyperCOD基准上达到新的SOTA性能，并在其他公开HSI数据集上展现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: HyperCOD数据集和HSC-SAM基线为高光谱伪装目标检测这一新兴领域提供了坚实基础，将推动未来研究发展

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

TL;DR: I2E提出了一种"分解-行动"的图像编辑新范式，将图像分解为可操作的对象层，通过物理感知的视觉-语言-动作代理将复杂指令解析为原子动作序列，显著提升了组合编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于端到端像素级修复的图像编辑方法在组合编辑任务中存在三大局限：1) 规划与执行的隐式耦合；2) 缺乏对象级控制粒度；3) 依赖非结构化、像素中心的建模。这些限制导致在处理需要精确局部控制和复杂多对象空间推理的编辑任务时表现不佳。

Method: I2E采用"分解-行动"范式：首先使用分解器将非结构化图像转换为离散、可操作的对象层，然后引入物理感知的视觉-语言-动作代理，通过链式思维推理将复杂指令解析为一系列原子动作。同时构建了I2E-Bench基准，专门用于多实例空间推理和高精度编辑评估。

Result: 在I2E-Bench和多个公共基准上的实验结果表明，I2E在处理复杂组合指令、保持物理合理性以及确保多轮编辑稳定性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: I2E通过结构化环境中的可操作交互过程重新审视图像编辑，解决了传统像素级修复范式的根本局限性，为复杂组合编辑任务提供了更精确、更可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的VideoLLMs后训练方法主要关注整体内容理解（如字幕生成、视频问答），缺乏对内在时序连贯性和帧间相关性的显式监督，限制了模型捕捉复杂动态和细粒度视觉因果关系的能力。

Method: 提出MVP（掩码视频预测）目标，要求模型从一组具有挑战性的干扰项中重构掩码的连续视频片段；开发可扩展的数据合成管道，将任意视频语料库转换为MVP训练样本；采用GRPO（组相对策略优化）和细粒度奖励函数来增强模型对视频上下文和时序属性的理解。

Result: 综合评估表明，MVP通过直接强化时序推理和因果理解，显著提升了视频推理能力。

Conclusion: MVP作为一种新颖的后训练目标，通过显式监督时序连贯性和帧间相关性，有效弥补了现有VideoLLMs在捕捉复杂动态和视觉因果关系方面的不足，提升了视频推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDESplat提出迭代深度概率提升方法，通过级联warp操作和多层DPBU单元，显著提升3D高斯泼溅中高斯均值的预测精度，实现高质量场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法通常依赖单一warp操作估计深度概率，难以充分利用跨视角几何线索，导致深度图不稳定且粗糙，进而影响高斯均值的准确预测。

Method: 提出IDESplat框架：1) 引入深度概率提升单元(DPBU)，通过级联warp操作以乘法方式集成极线注意力图；2) 堆叠多个DPBU构建迭代深度估计过程，逐步识别高概率深度候选；3) 迭代提升深度概率估计并更新深度候选，逐步优化深度图以获得准确高斯均值。

Result: 在RealEstate10K、ACID和DL3DV数据集上取得优异重建质量，实现SOTA性能且保持实时效率。在RE10K上PSNR比DepthSplat提升0.33dB，仅使用10.7%参数和70%内存。跨数据集实验中，在DTU上PSNR比DepthSplat提升2.95dB，展示强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: IDESplat通过迭代深度概率提升机制有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中高斯均值预测的难题，实现了高质量、高效率的场景重建，并展现出优秀的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MDENeRF：通过NeRF不确定性迭代优化单目深度估计，融合单目全局结构与NeRF高频细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法生成的深度图通常过于平滑，缺乏精细的几何细节，限制了在自动驾驶、扩展现实等应用中的准确场景理解能力

Method: 提出三组件迭代框架：1) 初始单目深度估计提供全局结构；2) 在扰动视角上训练的NeRF，包含逐像素不确定性；3) 贝叶斯融合单目深度和NeRF深度，利用体积渲染过程推导NeRF不确定性来注入高频细节

Result: 在SUN RGB-D室内场景数据集上，在关键指标和实验中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: MDENeRF通过融合单目深度估计的全局结构和NeRF的高频细节，有效提升了深度估计的精度和几何细节，为场景理解提供了更准确的基础

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出SVL-DRL框架，通过分阶段强化学习解决医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，将每个体素视为自主智能体，动态修正错误标签影响。

Conclusion: SVL-DRL框架能有效处理医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，通过动态迭代更新策略自动减轻错误标签影响，无需人工干预，显著提升分割精度和语义完整性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

HemBLIP achieves higher caption quality and morphological accuracy, while LoRA adaptation provides further gains with significantly reduced computational cost. These results highlight the promise of vision language models for transparent and scalable hematological diagnostics.

### [58] [FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928)
*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI：一个高效的UI grounding框架，通过选择与指令相关的视觉token并保持位置连续性，显著减少计算开销同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在UI grounding任务中需要处理高分辨率截图，产生数千个视觉token，导致计算开销大且注意力稀释。而人类通常只关注感兴趣区域，因此需要更高效的UI grounding方法。

Method: 提出FocusUI框架，解决两个关键挑战：1) 通过融合指令条件分数和基于规则的UI图分数来消除冗余视觉token；2) 引入PosPad策略，将连续丢弃的视觉token压缩为特殊标记以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在四个grounding基准测试中超越GUI特定基线。在ScreenSpot-Pro基准上，FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B性能提升3.7%。即使只保留30%视觉token，性能仅下降3.2%，同时推理速度提升1.44倍，GPU峰值内存降低17%。

Conclusion: FocusUI通过选择性视觉token保留和位置连续性保护，实现了高效且准确的UI grounding，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResTok提出了一种新的视觉tokenizer，通过构建层次化残差表示来改进自回归图像生成，相比传统语言式tokenizer更好地适应视觉数据的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有1D视觉tokenizer直接借鉴语言建模设计，忽略了视觉数据的关键特性：层次化和残差网络设计对视觉模型的收敛和效率至关重要。需要将"视觉"特性重新引入视觉tokenizer。

Method: 提出ResTok：1D视觉tokenizer，为图像token和潜在token构建层次化残差表示。通过渐进合并获得层次化表示，实现跨层特征融合；层次间的语义残差防止信息重叠。同时引入层次化AR生成器，通过一次预测整个层级的潜在token来加速生成过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上仅用9个采样步骤就达到了2.34的gFID分数，显著改进了自回归图像生成性能。

Conclusion: 在视觉tokenization中恢复层次化残差先验能显著提升自回归图像生成效果，ResTok通过适应视觉特性的设计实现了更高效的生成。

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

TL;DR: 提出FUSION：首个基于扩散模型的无条件全身运动先验，联合建模身体和手部运动，解决现有方法忽略手部或任务范围狭窄的问题

Conclusion: FUSION是首个联合建模身体和手部运动的扩散模型先验，在标准基准测试中表现优异，并能通过优化流程支持特定应用，实现对精细手部运动的精确控制同时保持合理的全身协调

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Padé神经元(Paons)的新型非线性神经元模型，基于Padé近似，比传统McCulloch-Pitts神经元具有更强的非线性能力，且能包含现有神经元模型作为特例。


<details>

Motivation: 传统神经网络使用McCulloch-Pitts神经元模型（线性模型加逐点非线性激活），虽然已有二次神经元、广义运算神经元等非线性模型，但需要更强的非线性表达能力。作者受Padé近似启发，希望开发更优的非线性神经元模型。

Method: 提出Padé神经元(Paons)模型，基于Padé近似构建非线性函数。每个Paon学习输入的不同非线性函数，具有非线性多样性。Paons包含所有先前提出的神经元模型作为特例，因此可将任何网络中的任何神经元替换为Paons。

Conclusion: Padé神经元(Paons)是一种优越的非线性神经元模型，具有非线性多样性和层效率优势，能提升神经网络性能，且开源实现可供使用。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

Conclusion: REACT专门针对生成视频中的结构失真评估，通过创新的数据集构建、训练框架和推理机制，有效解决了现有模型忽略的结构质量问题

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的注释高效分割框架通过区域分类方法解决了传统深度学习方法对大量标注数据的依赖问题，实现了可靠的风力涡轮机叶片分割，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

TL;DR: 本文发现大型多模态模型存在"文本惯性"问题：一旦推理链中出现文本幻觉，模型会盲目坚持错误文本而忽略冲突的视觉证据，提出Active Visual-Context Refinement方法有效缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视频推理中展现出强大能力，但其推理链的鲁棒性存在问题。研究发现模型存在"文本惯性"现象，即一旦推理过程中出现文本幻觉，模型会盲目坚持错误文本而忽略冲突的视觉证据，这严重影响了推理的可靠性。

Method: 1. 提出LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol，在多样化LMMs的推理链中结构化注入扰动，评估其自我反思能力；2. 提出Active Visual-Context Refinement方法，这是一种无需训练的新型推理范式，通过主动视觉重定位机制强制细粒度验证，并结合自适应上下文精炼策略来总结和去噪推理历史。

Result: 实验结果显示：1. 模型在不到10%的情况下能成功自我纠正，主要倾向于盲目的文本错误传播；2. 提出的Active Visual-Context Refinement方法能显著抑制幻觉传播，增强推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型存在严重的文本惯性问题，导致推理链脆弱。提出的Active Visual-Context Refinement方法通过主动视觉重定位和上下文精炼，有效缓解了幻觉传播问题，提升了推理的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了桥接基础重建模型的强先验和视频扩散模型的能力，实现场景级的3D生成，同时探索重建模型与生成模型紧密耦合的相互益处。

Method: 重新利用VGGT重建模型生成几何潜在表示，通过在其token上训练适配器，并正则化使其与预训练视频扩散模型的外观潜在表示对齐。通过联合生成这些解耦但对齐的潜在表示，同时产生RGB视频和对应的3D几何信息（相机姿态、深度图、全局点云）。

Result: 在单图像和多图像条件下的3D场景生成中取得了最先进的结果。此外，该方法通过利用生成先验增强了重建的鲁棒性，展示了重建模型与生成模型紧密耦合的相互益处。

Conclusion: Gen3R成功地将基础重建模型与视频扩散模型相结合，实现了高质量的3D场景生成，并证明了重建模型与生成模型紧密耦合的协同效应。

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

TL;DR: GeoReason框架通过构建逻辑驱动数据集和两阶段训练策略，解决遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，提升空间决策的认知可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前遥感视觉语言模型(RS-VLMs)存在逻辑幻觉问题，即正确答案来自错误的推理链或依赖位置捷径而非空间逻辑，这削弱了复杂空间任务中的认知可靠性。需要从感知中心识别转向高级演绎推理。

Method: 提出GeoReason框架：1) 构建GeoReason-Bench数据集(4000个推理轨迹)；2) 两阶段训练：监督知识初始化(学习推理语法和领域知识) + 一致性感知强化学习(引入逻辑一致性奖励，通过选项排列策略惩罚逻辑漂移)。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了RS-VLMs的认知可靠性和可解释性，相比其他先进方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoReason通过同步内部思考与最终决策，有效解决了遥感视觉语言模型的逻辑幻觉问题，为复杂空间任务的可靠推理提供了新框架。

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星持续产生海量数据，特别是地球观测中的卫星图像时间序列(SITS)。现有深度学习模型大多处理完整图像或时间序列，难以有效提取像素级特征。需要更有效的表示方法来编码SITS中的视觉属性变化。

Method: 1) 从像素级植被指数时间序列(NDVI, EVI, SAVI)生成递归图作为2D表示；2) 提出PIMC多模态自监督方法，结合2D像素时间序列表示和遥感影像进行对比学习；3) 在PASTIS数据集上进行像素级预测和分类，在EuroSAT数据集上进行土地覆盖分类。

Result: 实验表明：1) 2D表示显著增强SITS特征提取能力；2) 对比学习提升像素时间序列和遥感影像表示质量；3) 多模态方法在各种地球观测任务中超越现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态方法为处理SITS和遥感影像提供了鲁棒的自监督框架，2D表示和对比学习的结合有效提升了地球观测任务性能。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear是一个音频-视频联合生成系统，通过改进模型架构、训练策略和数据构建，解决了现有方法中的音频-视频异步、唇语对齐差和单模态退化等问题，在联合和单模态生成任务中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频联合生成方法存在三个主要问题：音频-视频异步、唇语-语音对齐差、单模态退化。这些问题源于音频-视频对应建模弱、泛化能力有限、高质量密集标注数据稀缺。需要从模型架构、训练策略和数据构建三个维度进行系统性改进。

Method: 1. 架构：采用单塔设计，统一DiT块和Omni-Full Attention机制，实现紧密的音频-视频对齐和强可扩展性。
2. 训练：采用渐进式多任务策略（随机模态掩码到跨任务联合优化）和多阶段课程学习，增强鲁棒表示、强化A-V对齐世界知识、防止单模态崩溃。
3. 数据：构建首个大规模带密集标注的音频-视频数据集，开发自动化数据构建流程，标注和过滤数百万个多样化、高质量、严格对齐的音频-视频-标注三元组。

Result: Klear能够扩展到大规模数据集，在联合和单模态设置下均能生成高保真、语义和时间对齐、遵循指令的内容，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。在所有任务中，Klear大幅超越先前方法，性能可与Veo 3相媲美。

Conclusion: Klear通过系统性地解决音频-视频联合生成中的核心挑战，提供了一个统一、可扩展的路径，为下一代音频-视频合成技术奠定了基础。该方法在架构、训练和数据三个关键维度上的创新，使得模型能够实现高质量的音频-视频对齐生成。

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-DRF方法，使用冻结的视觉语言模型作为免训练评判器，通过可微奖励流优化视频扩散模型，避免传统偏好优化方法的标签依赖和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的视频生成方法依赖不可微的偏好信号（人工标注或奖励模型），导致训练标签密集、易产生偏见、容易被攻击，常引发奖励黑客和不稳定训练。

Method: 使用冻结的现成视觉语言模型作为免训练评判器，通过可微奖励流将VLM的logit级响应转换为token感知梯度进行优化；提出自动化、方面结构化的提示管道获取可靠的多维度VLM反馈；使用梯度检查点技术实现高效更新。

Result: Diffusion-DRF提高了视频质量和语义对齐，同时缓解了奖励黑客和崩溃问题，无需额外的奖励模型或偏好数据集；该方法具有模型无关性，可轻松推广到其他基于扩散的生成任务。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效、稳定、免训练的优化方法，避免了传统偏好优化方法的局限性，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

TL;DR: ToTMNet提出了一种轻量级rPPG架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG方法虽然提高了鲁棒性，但计算成本和参数数量增加，注意力机制的时间建模会带来时间长度二次方复杂度。需要更轻量高效的架构。

Method: 提出ToTMNet架构，用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制。Toeplitz算子使用线性参数提供全序列时间感受野，通过循环嵌入和FFT卷积实现近线性时间计算。结合局部深度时间卷积分支和门控全局Toeplitz混合。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG数据集上达到1.055 bpm MAE和0.996 Pearson相关系数；在合成到真实场景(SCAMPS到UBFC-rPPG)达到1.582 bpm MAE和0.994相关系数。仅使用63k参数。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构时间混合是rPPG中注意力机制的高效实用替代方案，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。门控机制对有效利用全局Toeplitz混合至关重要。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两难：2D图像方法易于构建维护但几何推理有限，3D结构方法精度高但需要集中重建且难以更新。需要一种既能保持2D方法易用性又能获得3D方法精度的方案。

Method: 采用2D图像表示并增强每张图像的深度图来捕获几何结构，结合密集匹配器，使用紧凑压缩和GPU加速的LO-RANSAC实现，在存储和计算上高效。

Conclusion: 通过2D图像增强深度图的表示方法，结合密集匹配技术，实现了既易于构建维护又具有高精度的视觉定位方案，在效率和精度上都取得了突破。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Motivation: 现实世界中的动态物体不断演化、变形和相互作用，产生多样的4D场景动态。传统基于规则的图形管道需要类别特定的启发式方法，劳动密集且不可扩展；而基于学习的方法需要大规模数据集，可能无法覆盖所有感兴趣的物体类别。

Conclusion: CHORD提供了一个通用、灵活且类别无关的解决方案，用于合成复杂的4D场景动态，克服了传统方法和数据驱动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究代理主要优化搜索策略以最大化检索概率，但存在检索-利用差距的关键瓶颈：即使在检索到黄金证据后，模型在噪声环境中由于上下文盲区而无法有效利用这些证据

Method: 提出DeepResearch-Slice神经符号框架，不同于隐式注意力机制，该方法预测精确的跨度索引，在推理前执行确定性硬过滤，为冻结的主干模型提供显式的基础机制

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛评估显示显著的鲁棒性提升。应用于冻结主干模型时，相对改进达到73%（从19.1%提升至33.0%），有效缓解噪声问题且无需更新推理模型的参数

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在开放式研究中需要显式的基础机制，DeepResearch-Slice通过神经符号方法有效解决了检索-利用差距问题

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现内部推理存在结构限制，无法完全消除语言模型的谄媚行为，而外部约束机制（RCA）能彻底消除谄媚，验证了外部结构约束对AI安全的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究大语言模型中的谄媚现象（sycophancy）——模型倾向于迎合用户而非坚持正确性，需要确定这种现象是需要外部监管还是可以通过内部推理自行缓解。

Method: 使用对抗性数据集CAP-GSM8K（N=500），在GPT-3.5、GPT-4o和GPT-5.1上比较内部推理机制（思维链CoT）和外部约束机制（RCA）的效果。

Result: 内部推理在弱模型中导致性能崩溃（优先悖论），在先进模型中仍有11.4%的输出差距；而RCA在所有层级模型中都能完全消除谄媚现象（0.0%）。

Conclusion: 研究提出了热力学层次理论：只有能力匹配且强大的混合系统才能达到共振（最优效率），而弱或不匹配的系统会陷入不和谐和熵增。这证实了外部结构约束对保证AI安全的严格必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型安全评估方法主要采用受限制的基于示例的方法，这种方法覆盖范围有限，难以全面识别模型的安全漏洞。需要一种更全面、可扩展的方法来评估LLM的安全性。

Method: 使用攻击LLM生成大量多样化的对抗提示，然后通过偏好数据集微调攻击模型，实现策略覆盖、攻击策略多样性和提示保真度三个关键目标的帕累托最优。

Result: Jailbreak-Zero在攻击成功率上显著优于现有最先进技术，对开源和专有模型（如GPT-40和Claude 3.5）都表现出色，同时生成人类可读且有效的对抗提示，需要最少的人工干预。

Conclusion: Jailbreak-Zero提供了一个更可扩展和全面的解决方案，用于识别和缓解LLM的安全漏洞，将安全评估范式从基于示例的方法转变为更有效的基于策略的框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

Result: gpt-oss模型在各项任务中表现优异，性能可媲美或超越DeepSeek-R1和o4-mini，尽管模型规模显著更小。微调后，gpt-oss-20b的诊断准确性显著提升，接近GPT-5的性能水平。

Conclusion: 本地部署的LLMs能够提供准确、可适应且隐私保护的临床决策支持，为LLMs更广泛地融入常规临床实践提供了实用路径，特别适合资源受限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

TL;DR: GPT-5是一个统一系统，包含智能快速模型、深度推理模型和实时路由器，通过安全训练减少幻觉，在写作、编程和健康领域表现优异，对生物化学领域采取预防性安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenAI推出GPT-5旨在创建一个更实用、更安全的AI系统，通过统一架构解决不同复杂度的问题，同时减少幻觉、改善指令遵循，并在关键应用领域提升性能。

Method: GPT-5采用三组件架构：快速回答模型、深度推理模型和实时路由器。路由器基于对话类型、复杂度、工具需求和用户意图动态选择模型，并通过用户反馈持续训练。系统还包含安全完成机制防止违规内容。

Result: GPT-5在基准测试中超越前代模型，响应速度更快，对真实世界查询更有用。在减少幻觉、改善指令遵循和降低谄媚性方面取得显著进展，在写作、编程和健康三个最常见应用领域性能提升。

Conclusion: GPT-5是一个更强大、更实用的AI系统，通过分层架构和持续学习优化性能。OpenAI对生物化学领域采取预防性安全措施，将gpt-5-thinking视为高风险能力模型并激活相应防护机制。

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

TL;DR: SLMs在推理任务上表现不佳，但在实际工业应用（如语气修改）中表现良好，作者提出了专门评估SLMs在非推理任务上能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估过于关注推理和问题解决任务，这无法准确反映小型语言模型（SLMs）在实际工业应用中的真实能力，特别是在非推理任务上的表现。

Method: 提出了专门针对SLMs的评估框架，包含数据生成、提示调优和基于LLM的评估方法，特别关注任务特定的微调能力。

Result: SLMs在推理任务上得分比LLMs低3-4倍，但在实际工业应用（如语气修改任务）中表现有效，证明了任务特定微调的潜力。

Conclusion: 需要为SLMs和LLMs开发更实用的评估工具，特别是在边缘计算和私有计算场景中，以更好地反映它们在真实工业应用中的能力。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在企业部署中暴露出关键限制：对自定义指令的遵循不一致。企业环境需要精确的指令遵循以确保可靠性和安全性，而现有模型在这方面存在不足。

Method: 对13个领先的LLMs进行综合评估，包括指令遵循性、响应准确性和性能指标。采用系统化测试方法，使用样本和企业级评估协议，在真实世界的RAG场景中进行测试。

Result: 不同模型在指令遵循方面差异显著，Claude-Sonnet-4和GPT-5获得最高评分。研究发现存在"指令差距"现象：模型擅长通用任务，但在企业部署所需的精确指令遵循方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为企业部署LLM解决方案提供了实用见解，并为各大模型家族的指令遵循能力建立了基准。强调需要改进模型在精确指令遵循方面的能力，以满足企业级应用需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垂直领域LLM评估基准存在语义冗余和计算成本高的问题，且现有压缩方法依赖历史模型评估数据，无法应用于冷启动场景

Method: 1) 在少量领域数据上微调基础LLM以获取任务相关语义；2) 生成原始测试样本的高层语义嵌入；3) 在领域适应嵌入空间进行任务感知聚类；4) 引入数据集X-ray机制分析聚类几何结构，动态校准压缩强度

Result: 在专业领域数据集（特别是大规模3GPP通信基准）上，方法有效识别并移除冗余样本，减少90%以上评估成本，同时保持与完整基准的高保真度

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需历史性能数据的测试集压缩框架，解决了冷启动场景下的基准评估效率问题，显著降低了评估成本

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

TL;DR: GuardEval是一个多视角安全基准数据集，GGuard是基于Gemma3-12B微调的内容审核模型，在细粒度安全分类上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在内容审核方面存在局限性：难以处理隐式冒犯、微妙偏见和越狱提示等复杂情况，且依赖训练数据会强化社会偏见，导致不一致和有伦理问题的输出。

Method: 1) 创建GuardEval基准数据集，包含106个细粒度类别，涵盖人类情感、冒犯仇恨语言、性别种族偏见等安全关切；2) 基于Gemma3-12B使用QLoRA微调得到GGuard模型，用于细粒度内容审核。

Result: GGuard在评估中取得0.832的宏观F1分数，显著优于OpenAI Moderator（0.64）和Llama Guard（0.61）。多视角、以人为中心的安全基准能有效减少偏见和不一致的审核决策。

Conclusion: 多样化和有代表性的数据能实质性提升复杂边界案例的安全性、公平性和鲁棒性。GuardEval和GGuard展示了多视角安全基准对改进LLM内容审核系统的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

Motivation: 现有主题分割方法主要基于句子间的语义相似性，但缺乏LLMs所具有的长距离依赖关系和丰富知识

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对ARM64架构的虚拟张量核心软件架构，通过内存映射和NEON SIMD优化，在M2硬件上实现110M参数模型>60 tokens/秒的稳定吞吐，满足200ms心理语言学延迟阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署大语言模型受限于"内存墙"瓶颈，标准推理运行时存在高层抽象、动态调度和非对齐内存访问等显著开销，需要更高效的软件解决方案。

Method: 设计虚拟张量核心架构：1) 使用直接内存映射(mmap)绕过标准库容器；2) 实现手调NEON SIMD内核；3) 提出Tensor Virtualization Layout(TVL)确保权重矩阵100%缓存线利用率；4) 零拷贝加载器消除初始化延迟。

Result: 在M2硬件上，110M参数模型实现稳定吞吐>60 tokens/秒，满足200ms心理语言学延迟阈值，相比标准推理运行时显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 该软件架构为通用ARM硅芯片上的内存瓶颈研究提供了完全开源、可移植且确定性的参考实现，无需依赖专有硬件加速器，实现了边缘设备上高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

TL;DR: BPE tokenization transforms corpus statistics toward Zipfian power laws, reduces local token dependencies, and reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代Transformer模型使用的分词方案（特别是BPE）如何影响自然语言的统计特性，以及这些分词方案与Zipf定律等语言统计规律的关系。

Method: 1) 在Zipf频率分布假设下分析语料库的信息内容，推导槽熵期望值的闭式表达式；2) 实证研究BPE如何转换语料库统计特性；3) 在不同BPE深度下训练语言模型，分析模型预测熵的变化；4) 使用注意力机制诊断局部token依赖关系。

Result: 1) BPE的递归应用使token频率趋向Zipf幂律分布；2) BPE深度增加时，模型预测熵与Zipf推导预测的一致性增强；3) 更深的分词减少了局部token依赖，使经验分布更接近弱依赖（近似IID）状态。

Conclusion: BPE不仅作为压缩机制，还作为统计转换器，重建了自然语言的关键信息特性，揭示了分词方案与语言统计规律之间的深刻联系。

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

TL;DR: 研究发现训练数据中的隐喻会显著影响大语言模型的推理路径和跨领域错位程度，通过监测隐喻相关的潜在特征可以高精度检测错位内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明隐喻会影响人类决策，考虑到大语言模型训练数据中包含大量隐喻，本研究旨在探究隐喻是否也会影响LLMs的推理路径，特别是在跨领域错位问题中。

Method: 在预训练、微调和重新对齐阶段使用隐喻进行干预，观察模型跨领域错位程度的变化；通过监测大推理模型的全局和局部潜在特征，分析隐喻与特征激活之间的关系；基于这些特征设计错位内容检测器。

Result: 发现训练数据中的隐喻与大语言模型推理内容的错位程度存在强因果关系；通过隐喻干预可以显著改变模型的跨领域错位程度；设计的检测器能够高精度预测错位内容。

Conclusion: 隐喻确实会影响大语言模型的推理路径，特别是在跨领域错位问题中；通过监测隐喻相关的潜在特征可以有效检测错位内容，这为理解和缓解LLMs的错位问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

TL;DR: PersonaWeaver框架解决现有角色生成方法中的两种对齐偏差：积极道德偏见和乐于助人偏见，通过分离世界构建和行为构建来生成更具多样性的角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色生成方法存在两种对齐诱导的偏见：积极道德偏见（角色总是采取赞同立场）和乐于助人偏见（角色总是直接回答问题）。这些偏见虽然适合指令跟随系统，但抑制了戏剧张力，导致角色可预测性高。

Method: 引入PersonaWeaver框架，将世界构建（角色、人口统计特征）与行为构建（道德立场、互动风格）解耦，从而生成具有更多样化反应和道德立场的角色，以及在长度、语气、标点等风格标记上的二阶多样性。

Result: PersonaWeaver能够生成具有更多样化反应和道德立场的角色，同时产生在风格标记上的二阶多样性，解决了现有方法的对齐偏见问题。

Conclusion: 通过解耦世界构建和行为构建，PersonaWeaver框架能够生成更具戏剧张力和多样性的角色，克服了现有角色生成方法中的对齐偏见问题。

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

Conclusion: 对齐行为是数据保护的新杠杆，提出了首个实用的限制LLM规模数据可学习性的方法，无需访问或修改训练流程

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统存在两难：显式结构化记忆可解释但易受长上下文过载影响而变得脆弱；隐式记忆机制高效稳定但难以检查。需要结合两者优点的解决方案来处理长上下文中稀疏分散证据的查询任务。

Method: 提出LatentGraphMem框架：1) 在隐式空间存储图结构记忆以保证稳定性和效率；2) 提供任务特定的显式子图检索接口，在固定预算下返回紧凑的符号子图供下游推理和人工检查；3) 训练时生成显式图视图与冻结推理器交互进行问答监督；4) 推理时在隐式空间检索，仅外部化检索到的子图。

Result: 在多个模型规模的长视野基准测试中，LatentGraphMem始终优于代表性的显式图和隐式记忆基线方法，同时支持参数高效适配，并能灵活扩展到更大的推理器而不引入大型符号构件。

Conclusion: LatentGraphMem成功结合了隐式记忆的稳定性与显式记忆的可解释性，为处理长上下文中稀疏分散证据的LLM问答任务提供了有效的混合记忆解决方案。

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

Motivation: 验证系统生成的摘要具有挑战性，特别是在高风险医疗领域，需要精确的上下文归因。现有方法缺乏细粒度的归因评估，因此需要建立医疗领域基于方面的摘要生成基准，支持短语级别的上下文归因。

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality.

Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个新模型重新进行预训练和微调，成本高昂。需要一种无需训练就能将最新通用模型适配到临床领域的方法

Method: 提出跨架构代理调优（CAPT），利用对比解码技术，通过集成现有临床模型和最新通用模型，支持不同词汇表的模型，选择性注入临床相关信号

Result: 在6个临床分类和文本生成任务中，CAPT显著优于单个模型和现有集成方法（平均比UniTE高17.6%，比代理调优高41.4%），增强临床可操作性语言，减少上下文错误

Conclusion: CAPT提供了一种高效、无需训练的临床领域适配方法，能够利用现有临床模型资源，将最新通用模型快速适配到临床领域，同时保持其推理和流畅性

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

TL;DR: ASPECTSIM是一个简单可解释的框架，通过显式指定方面来评估文档相似性，相比传统整体方法显著提高了人机一致性（GPT-4o实现时约80%提升）。虽然开源LLMs表现较差，但两阶段优化能提升约140%的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档相似性评估采用整体方法，忽略了不同方面的差异。作者认为需要显式考虑特定方面来更准确地衡量文档相似性，这能更好地反映实际应用需求。

Method: 提出ASPECTSIM框架，要求基于显式指定的方面评估文档相似性。构建包含26K个方面-文档对的新基准，使用GPT-4o直接提示实现，并与开源LLMs和嵌入模型进行大规模元评估。

Result: GPT-4o实现的ASPECTSIM比传统整体相似性方法的人机一致性高约80%。开源LLMs直接提示效果差（20-30%一致性），但两阶段优化能提升约140%的一致性，但仍远低于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 显式考虑方面对文档相似性评估至关重要，需要修订标准实践。开源LLMs在捕捉方面条件相似性方面仍落后于大型专有模型，但通过优化可以显著改进。

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类和LLM在不同评分量表上的评分一致性，发现评分量表选择显著影响人类-LLM一致性，0-5分制在聚合任务中表现最佳，且群体可靠性可能掩盖基准异质性和性别群体间的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM越来越多地被用作自动评估器，但先前研究表明LLM评判者在提示改变时往往缺乏评分一致性。然而，评分量表本身的影响尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在通过比较人类和LLM在不同量表上的评分，深入理解LLM作为评判者的问题。

Method: 收集人类和LLM在三种评分量表上的评分数据，涵盖六个基准测试（包括客观、开放式主观和混合任务）。使用组内相关系数（ICC）测量绝对一致性，分析不同量表下LLM判断的一致性以及人类-LLM一致性，并考察群体可靠性是否掩盖基准异质性和性别群体差异。

Result: LLM判断在主观基准测试中跨量表不完全一致；评分量表选择显著影响人类-LLM一致性，即使组内面板可靠性很高；在聚合任务中，0-5分制产生最强的人类-LLM对齐；群体可靠性可能掩盖基准异质性和性别群体间的系统性对齐差异。

Conclusion: 评分量表设计是LLM作为评判者协议中的重要组成部分，需要仔细考虑量表选择并进行子级诊断，以确保评估的一致性和公平性，特别是在处理异质性任务和不同人口统计群体时。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

Motivation: 当前语言模型通过下一个词预测预训练学习世界知识和推理，但没有明确优化语言能力。需要弥补这一差距，模仿人类语言习得过程来提升模型的语言能力

Method: 提出L2T预训练框架，将原始文本转化为结构化输入输出对，在标准下一个词预测基础上加入语言学习任务，为模型提供明确的语言刺激

Result: 在原始文本和L2T数据混合预训练的模型在语言能力基准测试中表现更好且学习更快，同时在通用推理任务上保持竞争力

Conclusion: L2T框架通过整合语言学习任务有效提升语言模型的语言能力，加速语言习得过程，同时不损害通用推理能力

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs在时间序列分类任务中表现不佳并非因为缺乏时间结构理解能力，而是提示评估方法的局限性。通过线性探针直接分析模型内部表示，发现其时间序列理解能力远超提示评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的评估显示LLMs在时间序列分类任务上表现不佳，这引发了对LLMs是否真正理解时间序列结构的质疑。研究者想探究这种表现不佳是模型能力的真实反映，还是评估方法的局限性。

Method: 通过对比基于提示的生成与线性探针对相同内部表示的分析，使用零样本提示和线性探针两种方法评估LLMs的时间序列分类能力。进行分层分析，研究时间序列信息在不同transformer层中的分布，并考察视觉和多模态输入的影响。

Result: 零样本提示的F1分数仅为0.15-0.26（接近随机水平），而线性探针将平均F1提升至0.61-0.67，经常匹配甚至超过专门的时间序列模型。分层分析显示，类别区分性的时间序列信息在早期transformer层中就已出现，并通过视觉和多模态输入得到增强。

Conclusion: LLMs内部表示的时间序列理解能力与基于提示的评估结果存在系统性不匹配，当前评估方法严重低估了LLMs的时间序列理解能力。模型内部已经编码了有意义的时间结构信息，只是这些信息无法通过提示生成有效提取。

Abstract: Prompt-based evaluations suggest that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on time series classification, raising doubts about whether they encode meaningful temporal structure. We show that this conclusion reflects limitations of prompt-based generation rather than the model's representational capacity by directly comparing prompt outputs with linear probes over the same internal representations. While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding.

Result: 在十个开放模型上的实验显示：当前LLMs在流行病学推理上表现有限，多步推理最具挑战性；模型排名在不同子集间变化；规模大小不能预测成功；思维链提示对多步推理有益但其他方面效果不一

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性文本分割是NLP中长期存在的挑战性任务，由于主题边界定义复杂、话语结构多变，且需要平衡局部连贯性与全局上下文，这些困难阻碍了摘要、信息检索和问答等下游应用的发展。

Method: 提出SegNSP框架，将线性文本分割重构为下一个句子预测任务。采用标签无关的NSP方法，预测下一句是否延续当前主题，无需显式主题标签。结合分割感知损失函数和更难负采样策略，以更好地捕捉话语连续性。

Conclusion: SegNSP展示了竞争性和鲁棒的性能，证明了建模句子间连续性对于提高分割质量和支持下游NLP应用的有效性，为线性文本分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

Result: 在二元仇恨言论检测和多标签道德情感分类任务中，SMRA分别提升F1分数0.9和1.5，同时显著提高解释忠实度（IoU F1提升7.4pp，Token F1提升5.0pp），解释更简洁但充分性提升2.3pp，公平性保持稳定

Conclusion: SMRA通过道德原理监督实现了更忠实、可解释的仇恨言论检测，无需在性能和偏见之间做出权衡，并发布了HateBRMoralXplain数据集支持相关研究

Abstract: Hate speech detection models rely on surface-level lexical features, increasing vulnerability to spurious correlations and limiting robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability. We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp). Although explanations become more concise, sufficiency improves (+2.3 pp) and fairness remains stable, indicating more faithful rationales without performance or bias trade-offs

TL;DR: CALM框架通过解耦任务语义与文化概念，利用对比学习构建文化聚类，通过交叉注意力对齐文化特征，并采用专家混合机制自适应整合，赋予语言模型文化自我意识，实现持续适应和自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将文化视为静态背景知识，忽视了文化的动态演化特性，导致在需要真正文化敏感性的下游任务中可靠性不足。需要开发能够理解文化动态本质的模型。

Method: CALM框架：1) 解耦任务语义与显性文化概念及潜在文化信号；2) 通过对比学习形成结构化文化聚类；3) 通过交叉注意力对齐建立文化特征间的细粒度交互；4) 采用专家混合机制沿文化特定维度自适应整合；5) 构建文化基础内部身份状态；6) 通过自我提示反思学习实现持续适应和自我修正。

Result: 在多个跨文化基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CALM始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CALM成功赋予语言模型文化自我意识，通过结构化文化表示和自适应整合机制，实现了对动态文化环境的持续适应能力，显著提升了跨文化任务的性能。

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动提示优化依赖小规模评价子集的性能作为反馈信号，但如何选择评价子集通常被视为实现细节，缺乏原则性方法

Method: 提出SESS方法，将评价子集选择形式化为最大化目标集函数，证明在温和条件下该函数具有单调性和子模性，从而支持带理论保证的贪心选择

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和GPQA-Diamond数据集上，子模选择的评价子集相比随机或启发式基线能产生更好的优化提示

Conclusion: 评价子集选择对提示优化至关重要，子模方法提供了原则性解决方案，能显著提升优化效果

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 传统SFT依赖验证困惑度监控训练不足，因为它混淆了风格模仿与真实事实内化，需要能区分事实学习与语言学习的评估方法

Method: 提出KR-Test框架，使用自动生成的对比示例测量正确与错误续写的似然偏好，无需指令调优或生成解码，通过"盲测vs.先知"基线分析验证框架完整性

Result: 验证了KR-Test框架的完整性，并展示了其在分析LoRA训练动态中的诊断能力，揭示了语言收敛与知识保留之间的细粒度分离

Conclusion: KR-Test通过暴露语言收敛与知识保留之间的分离，增强了微调动态的可解释性，为监控SFT中的事实学习提供了更好的评估工具

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

TL;DR: RPAM通过模型合并实现自适应推理：将长推理模型与短推理模型合并，无需重新训练即可降低推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型为每个查询生成长推理路径，导致不必要的计算和延迟。现有加速方法需要重新训练或复杂提示工程，成本高昂且对输入敏感

Method: 提出推理模式对齐合并(RPAM)：构建模式标记校准集为查询分配推理模式，通过特征对齐优化层间合并系数，使用对比目标使合并模型表示远离非选择模型

Result: 在七个广泛使用的推理基准测试中，RPAM显著降低推理成本同时保持强大性能

Conclusion: RPAM提供了一种轻量级模型合并方法，实现查询自适应推理，无需从头训练或大规模额外数据，平衡了效率与性能

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntroLM：一种让因果语言模型在预填充阶段预测自身输出质量的方法，通过引入内省标记和标记条件LoRA，无需外部评估器即可预测输出质量，在问答基准上表现优于DeBERTa分类器，并在多模型路由系统中显著降低延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部分类器（如BERT模型）来预测LLM输出质量，但这些方法存在上下文窗口有限、表示能力受限和额外计算开销等问题。需要一种更高效、更准确的方法让LLM能够自我评估输出质量。

Method: 提出IntroLM方法：1）引入内省标记，让因果语言模型在预填充阶段预测输出质量而不影响生成；2）使用标记条件LoRA，仅在内省标记时激活，学习预测给定查询的输出质量，同时保持原始主干行为；3）避免使用外部评估器。

Result: 在问答基准测试中，应用于Qwen3 8B的IntroLM在成功预测方面达到90%的ROC AUC，比DeBERTa分类器高出14%。集成到多模型路由系统后，在匹配可靠性下，延迟降低高达33%，大模型使用量减少高达50%，实现了优越的成本性能权衡。

Conclusion: IntroLM提供了一种有效的方法让语言模型自我评估输出质量，无需外部分类器，在保持原始模型性能的同时显著提高了预测准确性，并在实际应用中实现了更好的成本效益平衡。

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准要么评估纯文本多会话记忆，要么评估局部多模态理解，无法评估多模态记忆在长期对话轨迹中的保持、组织和演化能力。

Method: 提出Mem-Gallery基准，包含高质量多会话对话，基于视觉和文本信息，具有长交互时间和丰富的多模态依赖关系。建立系统评估框架，从三个功能维度评估记忆能力：记忆提取与测试时适应、记忆推理、记忆知识管理。

Result: 对13个记忆系统的广泛基准测试显示：需要显式的多模态信息保留和记忆组织；记忆推理和知识管理存在持续局限性；当前模型存在效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: Mem-Gallery填补了多模态长期对话记忆评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM代理在记忆能力方面的关键挑战和改进方向。

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出个性化音频语言模型(PALM)任务，创建首个PALM-Bench基准测试，发现现有方法在建模个性化知识和跨任务迁移方面存在局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型(LALMs)虽然在音频理解和生成方面表现良好，但其行为过于通用（如总结口语内容），无法充分支持个性化问答（如总结我最好朋友说的话）。人类会根据每个人的个人背景进行解释和决策，因此需要弥补这一差距。

Method: 1. 形式化定义个性化音频语言模型(PALM)任务，包括识别个人概念和在个人背景下推理；2. 创建首个PALM-Bench基准测试，支持多说话者场景下的结构化评估；3. 对代表性开源LALMs进行广泛实验，评估训练自由提示和监督微调策略。

Result: 实验表明，现有的训练自由提示和监督微调策略虽然有所改进，但在建模个性化知识和跨任务鲁棒迁移方面仍然有限。现有方法无法充分处理个性化概念和上下文。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的个性化音频语言模型方法来解决现有局限，PALM-Bench基准测试将促进该领域的方法论进展。数据和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

Motivation: 现有的基于感知的自行车友好性评估方法存在局限性：难以捕捉道路环境的复杂性，且未能充分考虑用户主观感知的异质性。需要一种能够结合用户安全舒适感知并考虑个体差异的评估方法。

Method: 提出人物感知的视觉语言模型框架，包含三个创新贡献：1)基于既有自行车手分类的理论驱动人物设定，通过思维链推理生成人物特定解释；2)多粒度监督微调，结合稀缺的专家标注推理和丰富的用户评分进行联合预测和可解释评估；3)AI驱动的数据增强，创建受控配对数据以隔离基础设施变量影响。开发了全景图像众包系统收集了12,400个人物设定评估。

Conclusion: 该人物感知视觉语言模型框架能够有效评估自行车友好性，不仅提供准确的评分预测，还能解释评估结果背后的因素，为创建自行车友好型城市提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

TL;DR: DeepSynth-Eval：针对LLM自主代理在深度研究中信息整合能力的评估基准，通过逆向工程研究请求和构建"Oracle Contexts"来客观评估信息整合能力，发现代理式规划-写作流程显著优于单轮生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型向自主代理的演进推动了深度研究的发展，但检索后的信息整合阶段（代理需要消化大量上下文并将碎片化证据整合为连贯的长篇报告）由于开放式写作的主观性而缺乏客观评估。

Method: 引入DeepSynth-Eval基准，利用高质量综述论文作为黄金标准，逆向工程研究请求并从其参考文献构建"Oracle Contexts"，以将整合能力与检索噪声隔离。提出细粒度评估协议，使用通用检查表（用于事实覆盖）和约束检查表（用于结构组织），将主观判断转化为可验证指标。

Result: 在96个任务上的实验表明，从数百个参考文献中整合信息仍然是一个重大挑战。代理式规划-写作流程显著优于单轮生成，有效减少幻觉并提高对复杂结构约束的遵循度。

Conclusion: DeepSynth-Eval为评估LLM自主代理的信息整合能力提供了客观基准，揭示了当前模型在整合大量信息方面的局限性，并展示了代理式工作流程在提高合成质量和减少错误方面的优势。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards autonomous agents has catalyzed progress in Deep Research. While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing "Oracle Contexts" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在多跳推理中并不遵循"跳对齐电路假设"，而是出现"层序反转"现象，即后跳答案实体比桥接实体更早可解码。作者提出"概率召回-提取"框架来解释这一行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多跳推理上表现良好，但其内部如何组合多个事实仍不清楚。现有研究提出的"跳对齐电路假设"认为桥接实体在层间顺序计算，但这一假设在真实世界多跳查询中是否成立需要验证。

Method: 通过对真实世界多跳查询进行系统分析，发现层序反转现象，并提出"概率召回-提取"框架来建模多跳推理：浅层MLP层进行广泛概率召回，深层注意力层进行选择性提取。通过系统探测分析、重新解释先前层解码证据、解释思维链增益等方式进行实证验证。

Result: 研究发现"跳对齐电路假设"不能普遍成立，存在层序反转现象（后跳答案实体比桥接实体更早可解码），且这种现象随着总跳数增加而加强。提出的"概率召回-提取"框架能够解释这一行为，并为多跳推理失败提供机制诊断。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的多跳推理机制比简单的跳对齐假设更复杂，涉及浅层的广泛概率召回和深层的选择性提取过程。这一发现有助于理解思维链的增益机制，并为诊断多跳推理失败提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/laquabe/Layer-Order-Inversion.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding and leveraging long-range conversational memory, existing benchmarks still lack systematic evaluation of large language models(LLMs) across diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session settings. In this work, we propose EvolMem, a new benchmark for assessing multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agent systems. EvolMem is grounded in cognitive psychology and encompasses both declarative and non-declarative memory, further decomposed into multiple fine-grained abilities. To construct the benchmark, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that consists of topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations. This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines. Extensive evaluation reveals that no LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions. Moreover, agent memory mechanisms do not necessarily enhance LLMs' capabilities and often exhibit notable efficiency limitations. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/shenye7436/EvolMem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法通常单独测量隐私态度或共享意图，难以确定模型表达的价值是否像真实人类行为那样共同预测其下游数据共享行动。需要一种能评估在竞争态度下价值-行为对齐的方法。

Method: 提出基于情境的评估协议，在有限的历史记录会话中顺序管理隐私态度、亲社会性和数据共享接受度的标准化问卷。使用多组结构方程建模(MGSEM)识别从隐私关注和亲社会性到数据共享的关系，并提出以人为参照的方向一致性指标VAAR。

Result: 在多个LLM中观察到稳定但模型特定的隐私-PSA-AoDS特征，以及价值-行为对齐的显著异质性。不同模型在隐私关注和亲社会性如何预测数据共享行为方面表现出不同模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种系统评估LLM在隐私与亲社会冲突情境下价值-行为对齐的方法，揭示了不同模型在模拟人类决策时的差异，为理解AI系统的价值表达与行为一致性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

Motivation: 传统思维链推理存在暴露偏差和错误累积问题，早期错误会在自回归解码中不可逆地传播，影响多步数学问题求解的准确性

Method: 提出DiffCoT框架，将思维链推理重构为迭代去噪过程，通过滑动窗口机制在推理步骤层面集成扩散原理，同时引入因果扩散噪声调度以保持因果一致性

Result: 在三个多步思维链推理基准测试中，DiffCoT在不同模型骨干上均优于现有的思维链偏好优化方法，展现出更好的鲁棒性和纠错能力

Conclusion: 扩散风格的思维链推理框架能够有效缓解暴露偏差和错误累积问题，为多步推理任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLMs在持续预训练中的概念电路，揭示了概念学习与遗忘的动态模式、概念间的干扰与协同效应，为设计可解释的概念感知训练策略提供电路级视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过概念理解世界，但大型语言模型在持续预训练中如何获取、保留和遗忘概念仍不清楚。需要理解LLMs概念学习的动态过程及其内部机制。

Method: 研究概念获取与遗忘的动态过程，分析多个概念间的干扰与协同效应。将行为动态与LLMs内部的概念电路（计算子图）联系起来，并引入图度量来表征电路结构。

Result: 发现：(1)概念电路能显著反映概念学习与遗忘；(2)概念电路呈现阶段性时间模式（早期增加→逐渐减少→稳定）；(3)学习增益大的概念后续遗忘更严重；(4)语义相似概念干扰更强；(5)概念知识可迁移性不同，有些能显著促进其他概念学习。

Conclusion: 研究提供了概念学习动态的电路级视角，为设计更可解释、更鲁棒的概念感知训练策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PsychEthicsBench基准，基于澳大利亚心理学和精神病学指南，用于评估LLMs在心理健康领域的伦理知识和行为响应，发现拒绝率不能有效反映伦理行为，且领域特定微调可能降低伦理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在心理健康应用中的安全评估主要依赖拒绝信号，但这种方法无法捕捉临床实践所需的细微行为。在心理健康领域，临床不充分的拒绝可能被视为缺乏同理心并阻碍求助行为，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了PsychEthicsBench基准，基于澳大利亚心理学和精神病学指南，包含多项选择和开放式任务，带有细粒度的伦理标注。评估了14个模型，分析拒绝率与伦理行为的关系以及领域特定微调的影响。

Result: 拒绝率不能有效指示伦理行为，安全触发与临床适当性存在显著差异。领域特定微调可能降低伦理鲁棒性，多个专业模型在伦理对齐上表现不如其基础模型。

Conclusion: PsychEthicsBench为心理健康领域LLMs的系统性、司法管辖区感知评估提供了基础，鼓励该领域更负责任的发展。需要超越拒绝中心指标，采用更全面的伦理评估方法。

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment. PsychEthicsBench provides a foundation for systematic, jurisdiction-aware evaluation of LLMs in mental health, encouraging more responsible development in this domain.

*Juhyun Oh,Haneul Yoo,Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在处理多语言代码切换时存在输出语言对齐问题，即使人类能清晰理解语境线索，模型仍经常输出错误语言。研究者提出了OLA基准评估这一问题，发现前沿模型存在非英语响应偏见，且思维链提示无法解决，但少量数据微调可显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码切换是多语言用户的自然交流方式，但当前LLMs在处理用户代码切换提示时，无法根据上下文和语用线索正确推断输出语言，经常以用户不期望的语言回应，这在实际应用中造成根本性挑战。

Method: 提出了OLA（输出语言对齐）基准，专注于韩语-英语代码切换，涵盖从简单的句内混合到指令内容不匹配的各种场景。评估了前沿LLMs的性能，并测试了思维链提示的效果。最后通过少量数据（约1000个示例）的代码切换感知DPO微调来改善模型表现。

Result: 当前LLMs在代码切换交互中系统性失败，即使对人类清晰的线索也无法正确对齐输出语言，表现出明显的非英语响应偏见。这种偏见在中文和印尼语对中也普遍存在。模型还表现出不稳定性，如中途切换语言和语言侵入。思维链提示无法解决这些错误，表明模型缺乏对输出语言的语用推理能力。但少量数据的微调能显著减少不对齐问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码切换交互中的输出语言对齐失败源于对齐不足而非根本性限制。少量数据的针对性微调可显著改善性能。研究强调了在多语言LLMs中与用户隐含期望对齐的重要性，特别是在现实世界的代码切换交互中。

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Graph Reasoning框架，让大语言模型在开放域问答中构建图结构推理过程，提高推理一致性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理过程通常是线性的，容易产生逻辑不一致的问题，而现实世界推理需要整合多个前提并并行解决子问题。现有方法如思维链（CoT）以线性文本形式表达推理，虽然看似连贯但常导致不一致结论。现有方法依赖外部提供的图结构，未探索LLMs如何构建和使用自己的图结构推理。

Method: 提出Self-Graph Reasoning框架，使LLMs在生成最终答案前，能够显式地将推理过程表示为结构化图。构建图结构推理数据集，将多个候选推理图合并为精炼的图结构用于模型训练。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试（包括通用和专门领域）上，SGR持续提高推理一致性，相比基础模型获得17.74%的性能提升。使用SGR微调的LLaMA-3.3-70B模型性能与GPT-4o相当，超过Claude-3.5-Haiku。

Conclusion: 图结构推理能有效提高大语言模型在开放域问答中的推理一致性和性能，Self-Graph Reasoning框架为解决LLMs线性推理的局限性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得显著进展，但其事实性仍是关键挑战。现有事实性验证研究主要进行二元判断（正确/错误），无法区分不同程度的错误严重性，限制了其在细粒度评估和偏好优化等应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA)混合框架，结合生成式模型的代理搜索能力和判别式模型的精确评分能力。同时构建FGVeriBench基准测试作为细粒度事实性验证的稳健测试平台。

Result: 在FGVeriBench上的实验结果表明，DiVA在一般问题和多跳问题的事实性验证方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiVA框架通过结合生成式模型的搜索能力和判别式模型的评分能力，有效解决了细粒度事实性验证问题，为更精确的事实性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 音频语言模型通过推理痕迹为音频深度伪造检测提供可解释性，但本文发现显式推理并不总是增强鲁棒性，而是呈现分化：对具有稳健声学感知的模型，推理起到"盾牌"防御作用；对其他模型则造成性能"税负"，特别是在语言攻击下会降低认知一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频语言模型为音频深度伪造检测提供了可解释性，超越了传统的"黑盒"分类器。然而，这需要新的鲁棒性分析范式：不仅要关注最终预测结果的变化，更要评估在对抗攻击下预测推理过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一个法证审计框架，从三个相互关联的维度评估音频语言模型在对抗攻击下的推理鲁棒性：声学感知、认知一致性和认知失调。通过系统分析来研究显式推理对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 研究发现显式推理并不普遍增强鲁棒性。对于具有稳健声学感知的模型，推理起到防御"盾牌"作用；对其他模型则造成性能"税负"，特别是在语言攻击下会降低认知一致性并提高攻击成功率。即使在分类失败时，高认知失调也可作为"无声警报"标记潜在操纵。

Conclusion: 这项工作对推理在法证音频深度伪造分析中的作用及其脆弱性进行了关键评估，揭示了推理在音频语言模型鲁棒性中的复杂角色，为未来可解释音频深度伪造检测系统的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

Result: 1) 使用精心策划的任务特定数据集微调的小型开源模型在预咨询任务上可以超越前沿LLMs；2) HPI信息量增加不一定改善诊断性能；3) 预咨询语言影响对话特征。

Conclusion: EPAG为评估和开发LLM在真实临床环境中的应用提供了有价值的基准，开源数据集和评估流程将促进该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 首次系统比较推理大模型(LRMs)与非推理LLMs作为评估者的优劣，探究LRMs是否更适合作为判断者。

Method: 实证分析比较LRMs与非推理LLMs，并提出PlanJudge策略：让模型在执行前生成明确的评估计划来缓解偏见。

Result: 1) LRMs在判断准确性上优于非推理LLMs，尤其在推理密集型任务；2) LRMs在评估场景中指令遵循能力更强；3) LRMs对针对判断任务的对抗攻击更具鲁棒性；4) LRMs在表面质量上仍有强偏见；5) PlanJudge显著缓解了LRMs和标准LLMs的偏见。

Conclusion: LRMs作为评估者在多个维度优于非推理LLMs，但仍有偏见问题；PlanJudge策略能有效提升评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

Motivation: LLM智能体需要在动态环境中持续学习新任务而不发生灾难性遗忘，这被称为稳定性-可塑性困境。现有方法未能明确区分跨任务共享的通用知识和任务特定干扰引入的冲突知识。

Method: 提出Agent-Dice参数融合框架，采用两阶段知识解耦：1）几何共识过滤修剪冲突梯度；2）曲率重要性加权放大共享语义。基于方向共识评估，提供理论分析验证融合方案的有效性。

Result: 在GUI智能体和工具使用智能体领域的广泛实验表明，Agent-Dice在持续学习性能上表现优异，同时具有最小的计算开销和参数更新。

Conclusion: Agent-Dice通过明确区分通用知识和冲突知识，有效解决了LLM智能体持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，为智能体的长期适应性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents significantly extend the utility of LLMs by interacting with dynamic environments. However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本情感推断方法通常将情感视为个体说话者的确定性点估计，无法捕捉人际交流中固有的主观性、潜在模糊性和顺序耦合性。情感协调是人类互动的核心属性，需要更精细的建模方法来理解关系意义的实时构建。

Method: 提出LLM-MC-Affect概率框架，将情感建模为情感空间上的连续潜在概率分布。利用随机LLM解码和蒙特卡洛估计近似这些分布，生成高保真情感轨迹。通过顺序互相关和基于斜率的指标分析人际耦合，识别对话者之间的主导或滞后影响。

Result: 在师生教学对话的案例研究中，该方法的定量指标成功提炼出高层次互动洞察，如有效的脚手架教学。情感轨迹能够明确量化中心情感趋势和感知模糊性，为理解人际动态提供了可扩展的途径。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一个可扩展和可部署的途径来理解人际动态，提供了一个超越教育领域、适用于更广泛的社会和行为研究的通用解决方案。将情感视为概率分布而非静态标签，能够更好地捕捉人际交流的复杂性和动态性。

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统持续预训练方法在多语言大模型上面临的高计算成本和源语言性能下降问题。

Method: 包含两个阶段：1) ELO预训练：分离关键的第一层和最后一层进行目标语言训练；2) 层对齐：将训练好的层重新整合并进行简短全微调。

Result: 相比现有方法实现最高6.46倍训练加速，目标语言性能提升最高6.2%，同时有效保持英语源语言能力。

Conclusion: ELO方法为多语言大模型的持续预训练提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，显著降低计算成本并保持模型性能平衡。

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

TL;DR: SyncThink是一种无需训练、即插即用的解码方法，通过监控模型的推理转换信号来提前终止推理，显著减少Chain-of-Thought的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought提示虽然能提升推理能力，但会产生冗长的推理轨迹，大幅增加推理成本。研究发现答案token对早期推理关注较弱，主要关注特殊token "/think"，表明存在信息瓶颈。

Method: SyncThink基于观察到的信息瓶颈现象，监控模型自身的推理转换信号，在适当时候提前终止推理过程，无需修改模型权重，是一种训练免费、即插即用的解码方法。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU、GPQA和BBH四个基准测试中，SyncThink在三个DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型上平均Top-1准确率达到62.00%，仅使用656个生成token和28.68秒延迟，相比完整CoT解码的61.22%准确率、2141个token和92.01秒延迟，显著提升了效率。在GPQA等长视野任务中，SyncThink还能通过防止过度思考获得最高+8.1的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: SyncThink通过监控推理转换信号实现早期终止，有效减少了Chain-of-Thought的推理开销，在保持甚至提升准确率的同时大幅降低计算成本，特别适用于长视野推理任务。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often produces long and redundant traces that substantially increase inference cost. We present SyncThink, a training-free and plug-and-play decoding method that reduces CoT overhead without modifying model weights. We find that answer tokens attend weakly to early reasoning and instead focus on the special token "/think", indicating an information bottleneck. Building on this observation, SyncThink monitors the model's own reasoning-transition signal and terminates reasoning. Experiments on GSM8K, MMLU, GPQA, and BBH across three DeepSeek-R1 distilled models show that SyncThink achieves 62.00 percent average Top-1 accuracy using 656 generated tokens and 28.68 s latency, compared to 61.22 percent, 2141 tokens, and 92.01 s for full CoT decoding. On long-horizon tasks such as GPQA, SyncThink can further yield up to +8.1 absolute accuracy by preventing over-thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息系统涉及多种模态（文本查询、图像、视频、音频），需要全模态嵌入模型。但现有方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型的隐式对齐，导致三个问题：相似度对数尺度不一致、混合模态批次中负样本效果下降、跨模态统计特征不匹配。

Method: 提出e5-omni方法，包含三个组件：(1)模态感知温度校准对齐相似度尺度；(2)可控负样本课程学习与去偏，聚焦混淆负样本并减少假负样本影响；(3)批次白化与协方差正则化，匹配共享嵌入空间的跨模态几何结构。

Result: 在MMEB-V2和AudioCaps数据集上实验显示，e5-omni相比强双模态和全模态基线取得一致提升，且该方法能很好迁移到其他VLM骨干网络。

Conclusion: e5-omni通过轻量级显式对齐方法有效解决了多模态嵌入中的关键问题，提升了模型性能，且具有良好的可迁移性。

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

TL;DR: eTracer是一个可追溯文本生成的即插即用框架，通过将生成声明与上下文证据进行后验对齐，实现生物医学领域响应的可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学等高风险领域，如何高效验证系统生成的响应是一个关键挑战。传统基于句子级别的对齐方法存在局限性，需要更精确的声明级验证方法来确保响应的可信度和可验证性。

Method: eTracer采用后验对齐方法，将每个响应声明与上下文证据进行对齐（支持或反驳）。基于声明级对齐结果，框架不仅能让用户精确追溯响应到上下文来源，还能量化响应忠实度。

Result: 实验表明，声明级对齐方法缓解了传统句子级证据对齐方法的局限性，显著提高了整体对齐质量和用户验证效率。

Conclusion: eTracer通过声明级证据对齐实现了可追溯文本生成，提高了生物医学领域生成响应的可验证性和可信度，为高风险领域的响应验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency. The code and data are available at https://github.com/chubohao/eTracer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准基于干净证据构建，无法捕捉灾难管理中需要处理不确定和冲突信息的现实场景，因此需要专门评估模型在这种复杂环境下的表现。

Method: 通过人机协作流水线构建基准，采用分层抽样确保均衡覆盖；包含2000个选择题和1000个开放性问题；在不同证据条件下评估模型，从闭卷到噪声证据整合；为开放性问题提出基于关键点的人类验证评估协议。

Result: 测试20个模型显示与通用基准（如MMLU-Pro）存在显著差异；开源模型在干净环境下接近专有系统，但在现实噪声下性能急剧下降，暴露了灾难响应的可靠性差距。

Conclusion: DisastQA基准揭示了现有模型在灾难管理真实场景中的局限性，强调了开发能够处理不确定和冲突信息的鲁棒推理系统的重要性，为灾难响应AI系统提供了关键评估工具。

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response. All code, data, and evaluation resources are available at https://github.com/TamuChen18/DisastQA_open.

TL;DR: NeuronScope：一个多智能体框架，通过迭代激活引导过程解决LLM神经元多义性解释问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中神经元普遍存在多义性（单个神经元响应多个不同语义概念），现有单次解释方法难以准确捕捉这种多概念行为

Method: 提出NeuronScope多智能体框架，将神经元解释重构为迭代的激活引导过程：将神经元激活解构为原子语义组件，聚类为不同语义模式，并使用神经元激活反馈迭代优化每个解释

Result: 实验表明NeuronScope能够揭示隐藏的多义性，相比单次基线方法产生具有显著更高激活相关性的解释

Conclusion: NeuronScope通过多智能体迭代方法有效解决了LLM神经元多义性解释的挑战，提供更准确的神经元行为解释

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

TL;DR: STEPS：基于技能分类学的熵后训练数据合成框架，通过构建层次化技能分类学并最大化结构信息，生成组合性挑战数据以提升LLMs的组合泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和基于代理的系统在组合泛化方面存在困难，因为复杂技能组合遵循长尾幂律分布，形成了数据瓶颈，限制了指令跟随性能和代理中心任务的泛化能力。

Method: 提出STEPS框架：1) 使用结构信息理论揭示技能间的潜在关系，构建可解释的层次化技能分类学；2) 将数据合成公式化为约束信息最大化问题，在分类学中选择能最大化边际结构信息同时保持语义一致性的技能组合。

Result: 在具有挑战性的指令跟随基准测试中，STEPS优于现有的数据合成基线方法，并在下游基于代理的评估中展现出改进的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: STEPS通过构建技能分类学并基于信息最大化合成数据，有效解决了LLMs的组合泛化瓶颈问题，为提升指令跟随和代理任务性能提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FSLR训练框架通过专注于第一步逻辑推理（识别变量和操作），显著提升大语言模型在数学问题中的逻辑推理能力，相比CoT-SFT效果更好、训练更快、消耗更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大语言模型在数学问题解决中逻辑推理能力有限，主要依赖模式匹配和记忆，而逻辑关系理解错误占错误预测的90%以上，CoT-SFT无法有效减少这些错误。

Method: 提出FSLR（First-Step Logical Reasoning）训练框架，专注于训练模型在解决问题的第一步：识别要使用的变量和要应用的操作，从而直接鼓励模型从问题陈述中推导逻辑关系。

Result: FSLR在多个模型和数据集上一致优于CoT-SFT，在分布内和分布外设置下平均分别提升3.2%和4.6%，训练速度提升4-6倍，训练token消耗减少80%以上。

Conclusion: 通过专注于逻辑关系理解的第一步推理，FSLR提供了一种轻量级但高效的训练方法，能够显著提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力，同时大幅降低训练成本。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的指标无法捕捉创造力的主观性，需要开发新的评估框架来更好地评估AI生成的创造性文本。

Method: 使用"Spike Prompting"控制故事生成，通过115名读者的众包研究，分析不同创意组件如何影响人类对创造力的即时和反思性判断。

Result: 创造力评估是分层而非累积的，不同维度在不同判断阶段变得显著；反思性评估显著改变评分和评分者间一致性；框架能揭示被参考评估掩盖的创造力维度。

Conclusion: 提出的结构化框架能有效评估AI故事生成的创造力，揭示传统参考评估方法无法捕捉的创造力维度。

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

TL;DR: ADEPT提出自适应动态早退机制，在预填充和生成阶段实现token级别的动态早退，通过解耦跳过层的KV缓存依赖，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早退策略要么只适用于生成阶段的第一个token，要么只在预填充阶段应用，导致跳过层的KV缓存成为后续token生成的瓶颈，限制了早退的效益。

Method: 提出自适应token级别早退机制，根据token复杂度动态调整计算；通过解耦跳过层的序列依赖关系，优化KV生成过程，使token级别早退更实用。

Result: 在语言生成任务中效率提升达25%，下游分类任务实现4倍加速，性能提升高达45%。

Conclusion: ADEPT成功解决了KV缓存瓶颈问题，实现了预填充和生成阶段的自适应动态早退，显著提升大语言模型推理效率而不损失性能。

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR的性能主要依赖语言先验而非视觉能力，当去除语言支持时性能从90%暴跌至20%，且传统OCR方法比端到端方法更鲁棒，当前光学压缩技术可能加剧长上下文瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-OCR声称通过光学2D映射实现高比率视觉-文本压缩，解码文本token超过输入视觉token的十倍，这似乎为LLM长上下文瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。但需要探究其性能究竟是由视觉能力驱动还是语言先验支撑。

Method: 通过句子级和单词级语义破坏实验，分离模型的固有OCR能力与语言先验；比较了13个基线模型；分析视觉token数量与先验依赖的关系；进行上下文压力测试。

Result: 没有语言支持时，DeepSeek-OCR性能从约90%暴跌至20%；传统流水线OCR方法比端到端方法对语义扰动更鲁棒；视觉token数量越少，对先验的依赖越大，幻觉风险越高；在约10,000文本token时出现完全模型崩溃。

Conclusion: 当前光学压缩技术可能反而加剧长上下文瓶颈问题；研究实证定义了DeepSeek-OCR的能力边界，为未来视觉-文本压缩范式的优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

TL;DR: MIND是一个能力自适应的知识蒸馏框架，通过教学助手网络合成多样化的教师视角，使用反馈驱动的惯性校准机制，将知识蒸馏从被动模仿转变为主动认知构建，提升小模型在领域内和跨领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制学生模型遵循单一黄金推理路径，并将不同推理路径独立处理。由于师生模型不同的归纳偏好以及学生训练过程中不断变化的能力和推理偏好，教师的"最优"推理路径可能成为分布外噪声，导致学生潜在推理分布退化，造成次优性能。

Method: 提出MIND框架：1) 通过"教学助手"网络合成多样化的教师视角；2) 采用反馈驱动的惯性校准机制，利用惯性过滤的训练损失使监督与学生的当前适应能力对齐；3) 实现从被动模仿到主动认知构建的蒸馏过程。

Result: 在领域内和分布外基准测试中均达到最先进性能，复杂的潜在空间分析进一步证实了推理能力内化的机制。

Conclusion: MIND通过能力自适应框架有效解决了知识蒸馏中师生对齐问题，提升了小模型的推理能力和泛化性能，为将大语言模型能力转移到小模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's "optimal" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel "Teaching Assistant" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.

Conclusion: 验证了合成数据管道在开发更具包容性的语音技术方面的实用性，特别是在资源不足的语言中

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

Result: 发现LLMs偏好机构验证信息（如政府或报纸来源）而非个人和社交媒体信息。但这些来源偏好可以通过简单重复低可信度来源的信息而被逆转。提出的新方法能将重复偏差减少高达99.8%，同时保持至少88.8%的原始偏好。

Conclusion: LLMs在知识冲突中存在可预测的来源偏好，但容易受到重复效应的影响。提出的方法能有效减轻这种偏差，为知识密集型NLP中可信度和来源偏好的未来研究提供了重要工具和数据。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

### [144] [Evaluation of Multilingual LLMs Personalized Text Generation Capabilities Targeting Groups and Social-Media Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03752)
*Dominik Macko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在多语言环境下个性化文本生成的能力，分析了1080种个性化提示组合对文本可检测性的影响，发现平台个性化对文本检测影响更大，尤其在英语中效果最显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型多语言连贯文本生成能力的增强，引发了对其潜在滥用的担忧。先前研究表明这些模型可用于生成多语言的个性化虚假信息，且个性化会降低机器生成文本的可检测性，但这一现象仅在英语中得到研究。本研究旨在跨10种语言探索这一现象，不仅关注个性化能力的潜在滥用，也关注其潜在益处。

Method: 研究覆盖了1080种不同个性化方面的提示组合，使用16个不同的语言模型生成文本（总计17,280篇文本）。通过系统分析不同语言中针对人口统计群体和社交媒体平台的个性化效果，评估个性化质量对文本可检测性的影响。

Result: 结果显示，针对不同人口统计群体和社交媒体平台的个性化质量存在语言差异。平台个性化对生成文本可检测性的影响更大，特别是在英语中，其个性化质量最高。这表明个性化策略的有效性在不同语言环境中存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 个性化能力在不同语言中表现出不同的效果，平台个性化对文本可检测性的影响尤为显著。这强调了在多语言环境中评估语言模型潜在滥用风险的重要性，并为开发更有效的检测方法提供了见解。

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

### [145] [Do LLM Self-Explanations Help Users Predict Model Behavior? Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03775)
*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的自解释虽然不一定反映模型真实决策过程，但能帮助用户预测模型行为，特别是在反事实模拟任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能产生语言化的自解释，但先前研究表明这些解释可能无法可靠反映模型的真实决策过程。本文探讨这些解释是否仍能帮助用户预测模型行为，通过反事实可模拟性来操作化评估。

Method: 使用StrategyQA数据集，评估人类和LLM评判者在有无访问模型的思维链或事后解释的情况下，预测模型对反事实后续问题答案的能力。比较LLM生成的反事实与基于语用学的扰动作为评估解释潜在有用性的测试案例构建方法。

Result: 自解释一致提高了LLM评判者和人类的反事实模拟准确性，但增益程度和稳定性强烈依赖于扰动策略和评判者能力。人类用户的自由文本理由分析表明，访问解释有助于人类在扰动问题上形成更准确的预测。

Conclusion: LLM的自解释虽然不一定反映真实决策过程，但在帮助用户预测模型行为方面具有实际价值，特别是在反事实模拟任务中。解释的有用性取决于测试案例的构建方式和用户/评判者的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

*Marco Baroni,Emily Cheng,Iria deDios-Flores,Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索LLM表征的内在维度作为语言复杂性标记，发现不同ID模式能区分形式与功能复杂性，并与语言处理阶段相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM表征的内在维度是否能够作为语言复杂性的标记，并检验不同ID模式是否能够区分形式复杂性和功能复杂性。

Method: 通过分析LLM不同层的ID特征，对比形式复杂性（多从句协调或从属）和功能复杂性（右分支vs中心嵌入、明确vs模糊关系从句附着），使用表征相似性和层消融实验验证。

Result: 发现形式复杂性在ID差异中明显反映，且与先前研究中识别的更抽象语言处理阶段对齐；功能复杂性也被ID捕捉但程度较弱，且不与同一处理阶段相关。表征相似性和层消融实验确认相同趋势。

Conclusion: ID是LLM中语言复杂性的有用标记，能够区分不同类型的复杂性，并在不同LLM中指向相似的语言处理阶段。

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了音频大语言模型（ALLMs）仅通过声学声纹泄露用户隐私的风险，构建了包含22,000+真实音频片段的HearSay基准，发现ALLMs存在显著隐私泄露、安全机制不足、推理过程放大风险三大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型在理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但其潜在的隐私影响尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在首次调查ALLMs是否仅通过声学声纹就无意中泄露用户隐私。

Method: 构建了HearSay基准数据集，包含超过22,000个真实世界音频片段，通过自动化分析和人工验证的严格流程确保数据质量。在基准上进行了广泛的实验评估。

Result: 1. 显著隐私泄露：ALLMs从声纹中提取私人属性的准确率高达92.89%（性别识别），并能有效分析社会属性；2. 安全机制不足：现有防护措施严重不足，大多数模型无法拒绝隐私侵犯请求；3. 推理放大风险：思维链推理在能力强的模型中通过揭示更深层的声学相关性加剧了隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ALLMs的关键隐私漏洞，强调了进行针对性隐私对齐的紧迫性。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment. The codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/JinWang79/HearSay_Benchmark

### [148] [Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785)
*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Membox是一种分层记忆架构，通过Topic Loom将连续同主题对话分组为"记忆盒"，再通过Trace Weaver连接成长期事件时间线，显著提升LLM代理的时序推理能力，同时大幅减少上下文token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理记忆系统遵循"碎片化-补偿"范式：先将对话流分解为孤立话语存储，再尝试通过基于嵌入的检索恢复连贯性。这种方法不可逆地破坏了叙事和因果流程，同时使检索偏向词汇相似性，无法有效保持对话的主题连续性。

Method: 提出membox分层记忆架构：1) Topic Loom以滑动窗口方式持续监控对话，将连续同主题轮次分组为连贯的"记忆盒"进行存储；2) Trace Weaver将密封的记忆盒连接成长期事件时间线轨迹，恢复跨不连续性的宏观主题重现。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验显示，Membox在时序推理任务上实现高达68%的F1提升，优于Mem0、A-MEM等基线方法。值得注意的是，Membox仅使用现有方法所需上下文token的一小部分就取得了这些成果，在效率和效果之间实现了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模主题连续性，Membox提供了一种认知动机机制，既能增强LLM代理的连贯性，又能提高效率，为解决对话记忆中的主题连续性挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

TL;DR: InfiniteWeb系统自动生成大规模功能性网页环境用于GUI智能体训练，通过统一规范、任务驱动的测试开发等方法解决多页面网站构建挑战，实验证明其优于商业编码智能体并能显著提升GUI智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练GUI智能体面临合适环境稀缺的问题，现有方法难以生成具有多个互联页面的现实功能性网站，需要一种能够大规模自动生成训练环境的系统。

Method: 提出InfiniteWeb系统，采用统一规范、任务中心测试驱动开发、网站种子与参考设计图像结合确保多样性，同时生成可验证的任务评估器为强化学习提供密集奖励信号。

Result: InfiniteWeb在现实网站构建方面超越商业编码智能体，在其生成环境上训练的GUI智能体在OSWorld和Online-Mind2Web基准上取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: InfiniteWeb系统能有效解决GUI智能体训练环境稀缺问题，通过自动生成大规模功能性网页环境显著提升智能体性能，为实用AI助手发展提供有力支持。

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

TL;DR: 提出新的选择相关性评分，用于评估训练数据影响估计中选择策略的质量，发现常见策略常不如随机选择，并提出平衡影响力和代表性的新策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据影响估计方法量化训练文档对模型输出的贡献，可作为基于示例的解释来源。由于人类无法解释数千个文档，只能呈现少量训练数据作为解释。选择哪些文档直接影响解释质量，但先前评估大多忽略了选择策略。

Method: 提出新颖的选择相关性评分，这是一个无需重新训练的指标，量化一组示例对解释模型输出的有用程度。通过微调实验验证该评分，并基于此提出平衡影响力和代表性的选择策略。

Result: 验证了选择相关性评分能预测一组示例是支持还是削弱模型预测。发现常见选择策略常不如随机选择。提出的平衡策略能比简单选择最高排名示例更好地利用选择预算。

Conclusion: 训练数据影响估计中的选择策略对解释质量至关重要，提出的选择相关性评分和平衡策略能有效提升基于示例的解释效果。

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

Motivation: 新词感知机器翻译领域相对通用机器翻译研究不足，需要专门方法处理源语句中的新词翻译问题

Method: 1) 创建包含16种语言、75个翻译方向的新词翻译数据集；2) 基于维基词典构建搜索工具；3) 设计包含新颖奖励机制和自适应生成方法的强化学习训练框架，利用"翻译难度"提升翻译质量

Result: 构建了大规模多语言新词翻译数据集和检索语料库，开发了基于维基词典的搜索工具，提出了改进翻译质量的强化学习框架

Conclusion: NeoAMT框架为新词感知机器翻译提供了系统解决方案，包括数据集、工具和训练方法，填补了该领域的研究空白

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

### [152] [Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791)
*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的记忆评估框架CRM，通过控制提示线索来更准确地评估LLMs中的PII泄露问题，发现先前报告的PII泄露主要是由表面线索驱动而非真正的记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将LLMs成功重建PII解释为记忆证据，但作者认为这种评估方法存在问题，因为PII重建可能只是通过提示诱导的泛化或模式完成实现的，而非真正的记忆。

Method: 提出Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM)框架，通过控制提示-目标重叠线索来评估记忆。在32种语言和多种记忆范式下进行大规模多语言重新评估，包括逐字前缀-后缀完成、关联重建、无线索生成和成员推理等方法。

Result: 当控制表面形式线索时，重建成功率显著下降；无线索生成和成员推理的真实阳性率极低。先前报告的PII泄露主要是由线索驱动行为而非真正的记忆解释。

Conclusion: 可靠的隐私相关记忆评估需要控制线索，CRM框架为量化LLMs中的记忆提供了更准确的方法，先前关于PII泄露的发现可能被高估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了VietMed-MCQ数据集，这是一个针对越南传统医学的多选题基准，通过RAG管道生成并采用双重模型验证机制，包含3,190个问题，用于评估LLM在低资源医学领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用医学领域表现出色，但在越南传统医学等特定文化领域的表现显著下降，主要原因是缺乏高质量的结构化基准数据集。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道创建多选题数据集，并采用双重模型验证方法确保推理一致性，包含三个难度级别，由医学专家和学生进行人工验证。

Result: 数据集包含3,190个问题，获得94.2%的专家批准率，Fleiss' kappa为0.82。基准测试显示，具有中文先验知识的通用模型优于越南中心模型，但所有模型在复杂诊断推理方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: VietMed-MCQ填补了越南传统医学基准的空白，揭示了跨语言概念迁移的重要性，为低资源医学领域研究提供了有价值的工具和数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer模型中语义信息的编码位置高度依赖于提取方法，不同方法会得到不同的层间分布模式，但所有模型都显示出词汇属性较早、经验和情感维度较晚的深度排序规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型在何处编码心理学上有意义的语义信息，对于理论和实践都至关重要。需要系统研究不同模型架构和嵌入提取方法对语义信息编码位置的影响。

Method: 对10个Transformer模型（包括编码器和解码器架构）进行分层探测研究，涵盖58个心理语言学特征，比较三种嵌入提取方法（上下文嵌入和孤立嵌入）。

Result: 语义信息的定位高度依赖于方法：上下文嵌入比孤立嵌入具有更高的特征选择性和不同的层间分布。在所有模型和方法中，最后一层表示很少是线性探测恢复心理语言学信息的最佳选择。尽管存在差异，所有模型都显示出语义维度的共享深度排序模式：词汇属性较早达到峰值，经验和情感维度较晚达到峰值。

Conclusion: Transformer模型中语义信息的"位置"反映了方法论选择与架构约束之间的相互作用。研究强调了在解释模型内部表示时考虑提取方法的重要性，并揭示了跨模型共享的语义处理层次结构。

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了AI文本检测方法，发现基于上下文的深度学习模型（如DistilBERT）在检测AI生成文本方面优于传统的TF-IDF方法，准确率达88%以上，ROC-AUC达0.96。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，学生越来越多地使用AI生成的文本作为自己的作业，这违反了学术诚信。因此需要有效的方法来检测AI生成的文本。

Method: 使用HC3和DAIGT v2两个数据集构建统一基准，采用基于主题的数据分割以防止信息泄露。评估了传统机器学习模型（TF-IDF逻辑回归）和深度学习模型（BiLSTM、DistilBERT）的性能。

Result: TF-IDF逻辑回归达到82.87%的基线准确率。深度学习模型表现更优：BiLSTM准确率88.86%，DistilBERT准确率88.11%且ROC-AUC最高（0.96）。结果表明上下文语义建模显著优于词汇特征。

Conclusion: 基于上下文的深度学习模型在AI文本检测中表现最佳，适当的评估协议对防止主题记忆很重要。未来工作将扩展数据集多样性，使用参数高效微调方法（如LoRA），并探索更小的模型和硬件优化策略。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

TL;DR: 提出SPAE方法，通过Step Potential信号进行细粒度信用分配，改进RLVR中的推理过程监督，提高准确性并减少响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法缺乏语义基础的步骤级推理进度度量，导致LLMs无法区分必要推导和冗余验证，可能继续检查正确解或将正确轨迹推翻为错误答案。

Method: 引入无需训练的探测机制提取中间置信度和正确性，组合成Step Potential信号估计每一步的推理状态。基于此提出Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE)，进行细粒度信用分配：放大潜在收益、惩罚潜在下降、在潜力饱和后应用惩罚以鼓励及时终止。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPAE在提高准确性的同时显著减少响应长度，优于强RL基线和最近的高效推理及token级优势估计方法。

Conclusion: SPAE通过引入过程监督和细粒度信用分配，有效解决了RLVR中推理过程的监督不足问题，实现了更高效准确的推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods.

TL;DR: TabTrim：将表格剪枝从顺序修订转变为并行搜索的新框架，通过黄金轨迹监督提升表格问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格剪枝方法依赖顺序修订和不可靠的批判信号，容易丢失关键答案数据，需要更可靠的剪枝方法

Method: TabTrim框架：1）从黄金SQL查询执行过程中提取黄金剪枝轨迹；2）训练剪枝器和验证器使逐步剪枝结果对齐黄金轨迹；3）推理时进行并行搜索探索多个候选轨迹并选择最优子表

Result: TabTrim-8B达到73.5%平均准确率，比最强基线提升3.2%，在WikiTQ上达到79.4%，在TableBench上达到61.2%

Conclusion: TabTrim通过黄金轨迹监督和并行搜索机制，显著提升了表格剪枝的准确性和可靠性，在多种表格推理任务上实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

### [158] [What Does Loss Optimization Actually Teach, If Anything? Knowledge Dynamics in Continual Pre-training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03858)
*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Simone Alghisi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 损失优化与知识学习在持续预训练中存在系统性偏差，损失单调下降而事实学习不稳定且非单调，导致知识获取窗口狭窄和系统性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续预训练实践将损失作为知识学习的代理指标，但缺乏对训练过程中知识如何变化的深入理解。研究者希望将CPT视为知识学习过程而非单纯的优化问题，揭示损失优化与知识获取之间的真实关系。

Method: 构建受控的分布匹配事实文档基准，在CPT循环中直接插入诊断探针，实现知识获取动态和OOD通用技能变化的epoch级测量。分析CPT如何重塑训练过程中的知识电路。

Result: 在三个指令调优LLM和多种CPT策略中，优化与学习系统性偏离：损失单调下降而事实学习不稳定且非单调。获取的事实很少被巩固，学习强烈依赖于先前暴露，OOD性能从早期epoch就开始下降。电路分析显示知识通路在epoch间快速重新配置。

Conclusion: 损失优化与CPT中的学习进展存在错位，需要基于任务级学习动态的停止标准评估，而不是单纯依赖损失指标。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

TL;DR: PartisanLens：首个多语言超党派新闻标题数据集，涵盖西班牙语、意大利语和葡萄牙语，标注了超党派叙事和人口替代阴谋论，评估了LLM的分类性能和作为自动标注器的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超党派叙事和人口替代阴谋论（PRCT）对政治极化、制度信任和公共安全构成严重威胁，但现有资源稀缺、英语中心化，且往往孤立分析而非作为政治话语的相互关联方面。

Method: 创建PartisanLens多语言数据集（1617个新闻标题），评估LLM在超党派和PRCT分类上的性能，测试LLM作为自动标注器的可行性，并探索LLM通过社会经济和意识形态配置文件模拟人类标注模式。

Result: LLM在分类任务上表现出潜力但存在局限性；作为自动标注器能近似人类标注但不够完美；通过配置文件条件化可模拟人类标注模式；数据集为欧洲语境下的党派和阴谋论叙事检测提供了资源。

Conclusion: PartisanLens填补了多语言政治话语分析资源的空白，展示了LLM在检测有害叙事方面的潜力和局限，为未来研究提供了重要基础，特别是在欧洲语境下。

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文对LLM和LRM的安全对齐能力进行了大规模实证研究，评估了6个内在模型特性和3种外部攻击技术的影响，发现推理和自反机制对安全对齐至关重要，后训练和知识蒸馏可能降低安全性，CoT攻击通过响应前缀可大幅提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估什么因素影响LLM和LRM的安全对齐能力，为开发更安全可靠的AI系统提供关键见解。当前需要系统性地理解模型内在特性和外部攻击技术如何影响安全对齐。

Method: 使用32个近期流行的LLM和LRM（参数规模3B-235B，涵盖13个模型家族）进行大规模评估。利用5个已建立的安全数据集，通过56种越狱技术和4种CoT攻击策略探测模型漏洞，共进行460万次API调用。系统研究6个关键内在模型特性和3种外部攻击技术的影响。

Result: 1. GPT-OSS-20B、Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking和GPT-OSS-120B是最安全的三个LRM，表明集成推理和自反机制对安全对齐有显著优势。2. 后训练和知识蒸馏可能导致安全对齐系统性退化。3. 通过响应前缀的CoT攻击可将攻击成功率平均提升3.34倍，Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct从0.6%升至96.3%。4. 角色扮演、提示注入和基于梯度的对抗提示搜索是现代模型中引发未对齐行为的主要方法。

Conclusion: 安全必须作为后训练和知识蒸馏阶段的显式约束或核心优化目标，不能仅从属于通用能力追求。文本补全接口和允许用户定义响应前缀的LLM服务存在严重安全风险，需要架构和部署层面的保障措施。推理和自反机制对安全对齐至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个双路径框架，通过无训练聚类路由和基于强化学习的多步路由，动态选择最优的LLM-工具组合，在跨领域复杂推理任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和外部工具的多样性增加，选择最优的模型-工具组合成为一个高维优化挑战。现有方法通常依赖单一模型或固定工具调用逻辑，无法充分利用异构模型-工具对的性能差异。

Method: ATLAS采用双路径方法：1) 无训练聚类路由，利用经验先验进行领域特定对齐；2) 基于强化学习的多步路由，探索自主轨迹以实现分布外泛化。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ATLAS优于GPT-4o等闭源模型，在分布内任务上提升10.1%，在分布外任务上提升13.1%。在视觉推理任务中，通过编排专业多模态工具也显示出显著优势。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架通过动态工具使用和自适应路由机制，有效解决了异构模型-工具组合选择问题，在跨领域复杂推理任务中实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型在语法修正和文本简化任务上效率高但性能不足，无法与当前大型语言模型竞争


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大但计算成本高、部署困难，需要探索小型语言模型是否能在语法修正和文本简化任务上提供高效替代方案

Method: 在JFLEG和ASSET数据集上测试小型语言模型，包括开箱即用、微调和顺序运行三种方式，使用已建立的评估指标

Result: 小型语言模型虽然能学习某些行为，但性能仍低于强基线模型和当前大型语言模型，在保留原意和避免幻觉方面存在困难

Conclusion: 尽管小型语言模型具有效率优势，但在改写任务上仍无法与现代大型语言模型竞争，需要进一步训练改进来缩小性能差距

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法存在两个问题：1) 无差别触发检索会引入噪声；2) 单一路径证据构建限制了性能提升。需要更智能的检索决策机制

Method: 提出训练免费的DTR框架：1) 利用生成不确定性指导检索触发时机；2) 引入双路径检索机制，自适应选择外部信息；3) 特别处理稀疏和模糊查询

Result: 在五个开放域QA基准测试、多种模型规模和不同检索器上，DTR在EM和F1指标上持续优于标准RAG和强基线方法，同时减少了不必要的检索

Conclusion: DTR通过自适应检索决策和双路径信息选择机制，有效提升了检索增强生成的性能，同时降低了计算开销，为RAG系统提供了更智能的解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

TL;DR: 该研究通过表征分析和因果干预，揭示了语言模型在多选题回答中的两阶段机制：先选择正确答案内容，再将其绑定到输出符号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选题回答（MCQA）虽然易于评估，但引入了元任务：模型既要解决问题，又要输出代表答案的符号，这混淆了推理错误和符号绑定失败。研究者希望了解语言模型内部如何实现MCQA。

Method: 使用表征分析（PCA、线性探针）和因果干预来研究语言模型的内部机制。通过选项边界（换行）残差状态分析，并采用获胜者身份探针来追踪模型决策过程。

Result: 发现选项边界残差状态包含与每个选项正确性相关的强线性可解码信号。获胜者身份探针揭示了两阶段进展：获胜内容位置在最后一个选项处理后立即可解码，而输出符号表示则更接近答案输出位置。符号和内容排列测试支持两阶段机制。

Conclusion: 语言模型在多选题回答中采用两阶段机制：首先在内容空间中选择获胜者，然后将该获胜者绑定或路由到适当的符号进行输出。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

Motivation: 现有安全研究主要关注隐式社会规范或纯文本场景，忽视了多模态文档在动态用户定义政策下的复杂安全需求。实际文档问答需要跨异质视觉和文本元素进行推理，同时遵守严格的非披露政策

Method: 1) 构建Doc-PP基准测试，基于真实报告要求跨视觉和文本元素的推理；2) 提出DVA（分解-验证-聚合）结构推理框架，将推理过程与政策验证解耦

Result: 发现系统性"推理引发的安全漏洞"：模型在需要复杂合成或跨模态聚合推理时频繁泄露敏感信息；提供提取文本虽改善感知但无意中促进泄露；DVA框架显著优于标准提示防御方法

Conclusion: 多模态文档问答存在独特的安全挑战，需要专门的安全机制。DVA框架为政策合规的文档理解提供了稳健的基线解决方案

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

Motivation: 现有ABSA模型通常只支持三种基本情感类别，且缺乏对商业实际需求（如混合情感、未知情感、多语言支持）的适应。需要开发更强大、更实用的ABSA模型来满足真实商业场景的需求。

Method: 1) 使用大规模公开数据和精心生成的合成数据训练，数据集比SemEval14大20倍；2) 将情感类别从3类扩展到5类（正、负、中性、混合、未知）；3) 联合预测整体文本情感并支持多语言；4) 通过微调Chain-of-Thought示例注入推理能力；5) 为仅编码器模型引入新颖的推理预训练技术；6) 开发395M参数编码器和8B参数解码器模型。

Result: 1) 模型在SemEval14基准测试中创下新的SOTA结果；2) 比GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet准确率高出最多10个百分点；3) 单个多语言模型在六种语言中保持87-91%的准确率，且不降低英语性能；4) 发布了ABSA-mix基准，整合了17个公共ABSA数据集覆盖92个领域。

Conclusion: Arctic-ABSA通过扩展情感类别、多语言支持、推理注入等技术，开发出了适用于商业需求的强大ABSA模型，在性能和泛化能力上显著超越现有先进模型，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了有效对抗LLM生成的虚假信息传播，需要开发更强大的假新闻检测系统。现有方法在检测LLM生成的虚假内容方面存在不足，需要更鲁棒的检测机制。

Result: 在假新闻检测基准测试中，RADAR达到86.98% ROC-AUC，显著优于带检索的通用LLM。消融研究确认检测器端检索带来最大增益，而VAF和少样本演示为鲁棒训练提供关键信号。

Conclusion: RADAR通过检索增强检测器和对抗性精炼的有效结合，显著提升了假新闻检测性能，为对抗LLM生成的虚假信息提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: To efficiently combat the spread of LLM-generated misinformation, we present RADAR, a retrieval-augmented detector with adversarial refinement for robust fake news detection. Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型评估基准的快速增加，迫切需要系统方法来评估基准本身的质量。现有基准质量参差不齐，缺乏统一的质量评估标准。

Method: 提出Benchmark²框架，包含三个互补指标：1) 跨基准排名一致性：衡量基准产生的模型排名是否与其他基准一致；2) 区分度分数：量化基准区分不同模型的能力；3) 能力对齐偏差：识别同一模型家族中强模型失败而弱模型成功的异常实例。在15个基准（数学、推理、知识领域）上评估11个LLM（4个模型家族）。

Result: 实验显示现有基准质量存在显著差异，基于Benchmark²指标的选择性基准构建可以在大幅减少测试集规模的情况下获得可比较的评估性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark²为评估LLM基准质量提供了系统框架，有助于识别高质量基准并优化基准构建过程，提高评估效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政会议记录记录了地方民主进程的关键决策，但与标准化的议会记录不同，它们以高度异质、自由形式的叙述文本编码投票结果，各市政机构格式差异大，给自动化提取带来重大挑战。

Method: 引入VotIE（投票信息提取）任务，使用葡萄牙市政会议记录的CitiLink语料库建立首个基准。实验比较了微调编码器（如XLM-R-CRF）和生成式方法（LLMs）的性能，并在跨市设置中评估模型泛化能力。

Result: 1. 在标准域内评估中，微调编码器（XLM-R-CRF）达到93.2%宏F1，优于生成式方法；2. 在跨市评估中，微调模型性能显著下降，而少样本LLMs表现出更强的鲁棒性，性能下降较小；3. 尽管LLMs泛化更好，但其高计算成本限制了实用性。

Conclusion: 轻量级微调编码器目前仍是大规模实际部署的更实用选择。为支持行政NLP的可重复研究，公开发布了基准、训练模型和评估框架。

Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

### [170] [Layer-wise Positional Bias in Short-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04098)
*Maryam Rahimi,Mahdi Nouri,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于归因的框架来分析短上下文语言建模中的位置效应，发现位置重要性分布具有架构特异性、输入稳定性和词汇扰动不变性，揭示了模型深度与位置偏置的演化关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理输入时往往表现出对特定位置信息的偏好，而不考虑语义相关性。虽然位置偏置已在多种情境中被研究，但先前工作未能阐明这些偏置如何在各个层和输入位置之间演化，以及它们如何独立于任务复杂性而变化。

Method: 引入基于归因的分析框架，采用层传导度与滑动窗口方法，量化每一层在输入位置上的重要性分布，生成层级位置重要性剖面图。

Result: 研究发现：1) 位置重要性剖面具有架构特异性、输入稳定性和词汇扰动不变性；2) 存在显著的近因偏置，且随深度增加而增强；3) 存在微弱的首因偏置，随模型深度而减弱；4) 早期层在所有位置上优先加权内容词而非功能词，而后期层则失去这种词类区分。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了语言模型中位置效应的系统模式，这些模式独立于任务复杂性，为理解模型内部处理机制提供了新视角，有助于诊断和改进模型的位置偏置问题。

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

*Alexander Scarlatos,Jaewook Lee,Simon Woodhead,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM模拟学生的质量评估问题，提出了全面的评估指标，并发现现有模拟方法效果有限，需要进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在教育领域有很多创新应用，但评估新技术效果需要真实学生参与，这既耗时又难以规模化。当前许多LLM驱动的辅导解决方案使用模拟学生进行训练和评估，但很少有工作关注模拟学生的质量保证和测量。

Method: 正式定义了学生模拟任务，提出了一套涵盖语言、行为和认知三个维度的评估指标，并在真实数学辅导对话数据集上对多种学生模拟方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示：基于提示策略的学生模拟方法表现较差；监督微调和偏好优化方法表现更好但仍有限。自动评估和人工评估结果都表明当前模拟方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 学生模拟是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法效果有限，需要未来进一步研究改进模拟学生的质量。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LALMs作为语音生成质量评估工具存在明显缺陷，在多轮对话中难以可靠判断说话人一致性，表现出文本优先于声学特征的模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型（LALMs）已成为评估语音生成质量的主流方法，但其在多轮对话中判断说话人一致性的能力尚未被充分研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估LALMs是否能够可靠地评估多轮对话中的说话人一致性。

Method: 提出SpeakerSleuth基准，包含三个反映实际需求的任务。构建了1,818个人工验证的评估实例，涵盖四个多样化数据集（合成和真实语音），并控制声学难度。评估了9个广泛使用的LALMs。

Result: LALMs在检测声学不一致性方面表现不佳：有些模型过度预测不一致性，有些则过于宽松；难以精确定位问题轮次；当提供其他对话者轮次时，性能急剧下降，模型优先考虑文本连贯性而非声学线索，甚至无法检测明显的性别切换。但在从多个声学变体中选择最匹配说话人的音频时表现较好，显示出固有的声学辨别能力。

Conclusion: LALMs存在显著偏见：倾向于优先考虑文本而非声学特征，揭示了需要解决的基本模态不平衡问题，以构建可靠的音频-语言评估模型。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

TL;DR: 该论文研究多语言神经模型中的跨语言知识迁移，提出改进低资源机器翻译的方法，分析语言相似性、检索增强、辅助监督等对多语言学习的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言机器翻译系统旨在实现跨语言知识共享，但低资源语言由于平行数据有限，导致泛化和迁移能力受限。需要研究多语言模型如何在语言间共享知识，以及表示、数据可用性和训练策略之间的相互作用。

Method: 以机器翻译为主要测试平台，研究跨语言知识迁移：1) 分析语言相似性对迁移的影响；2) 使用检索和辅助监督增强低资源翻译；3) 研究并行数据微调对大型语言模型的意外权衡；4) 分析训练中语言多样性的作用。

Result: 研究表明：语言相似性影响知识迁移效果；检索和辅助监督能增强低资源翻译；增加翻译覆盖范围能改善泛化并减少离目标行为；并行数据微调在大型语言模型中存在权衡。

Conclusion: 建模选择和数据组成显著影响多语言学习效果。该工作为构建更具包容性和鲁棒性的多语言NLP系统提供了见解，强调需要优化训练策略和数据组合来改善跨语言知识迁移。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

TL;DR: ContextFocus是一种轻量级激活引导方法，可在知识冲突场景中提高LLM的上下文忠实度，无需微调且推理开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当外部检索证据与LLM内部记忆知识冲突时，模型往往依赖记忆事实而非上下文，导致输出不忠实。需要一种高效方法在知识冲突场景中提高上下文忠实度。

Method: 提出ContextFocus，一种轻量级激活引导方法，通过调整模型激活来提高上下文忠实度。该方法不需要模型微调，推理时开销最小，保持高效性。

Result: 在ConFiQA基准测试中，ContextFocus显著优于ContextDPO、COIECD和提示方法等基线。方法对提示策略具有互补性，在更大模型上仍有效。

Conclusion: ContextFocus在提高LLM输出的上下文忠实度方面表现出高效性、鲁棒性和有效性，为知识冲突场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型成为人类生活中不可或缺的助手，其生成的不安全内容对人类行为构成威胁。需要研究和评估MLLMs响应在日常生活中的安全影响。

Method: 提出SaLAD多模态安全基准，包含2,013个真实世界图像-文本样本，覆盖10个常见类别，采用平衡设计包含不安全场景和过度敏感案例。强调真实风险暴露、真实视觉输入和细粒度跨模态推理。提出基于安全警告的评估框架，鼓励模型提供清晰的信息性安全警告而非通用拒绝。

Result: 在18个MLLMs上的测试结果显示，表现最佳的模型在不安全查询上的安全响应率仅为57.2%。即使流行的安全对齐方法在作者场景中效果有限，揭示了当前MLLMs在识别日常生活中危险行为方面的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在识别日常生活中的危险行为方面存在显著漏洞，需要更有效的安全对齐方法。SaLAD基准为评估和改进MLLMs的安全性能提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

TL;DR: MPO是一个基于模式的提示优化框架，将提示视为结构化对象，通过局部文本梯度独立优化各个语义部分，同时保持整体模式固定，从而提升小规模开源语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法通常将提示视为整体文本块，难以定位错误、保留关键指令或防止提示无限增长。特别是对于依赖显式结构的小型开源指令调优模型，需要更精细、可控的优化方法。

Method: MPO将提示结构化分为固定语义部分（系统角色、上下文、任务描述、约束、输出格式），应用局部文本梯度独立优化每个部分，通过去重整合更新以减少冗余和组件间干扰。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和MMLU两个推理基准上，使用LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct和Mistral-7B-Instruct作为求解模型，MPO始终优于未调优的结构化提示和TextGrad基线，实现了显著的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 保持固定提示模式的同时应用局部、分节优化是提高小型开源语言模型推理性能的有效实用方法，为提示优化提供了可解释且稳健的框架。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

Motivation: 当前生成式建模在离散数据（文本）和连续数据（图像）上分别采用自回归和扩散方法，阻碍了真正统一的多模态系统发展。掩码语言模型虽然高效但缺乏生成保真度和语义连续性，且多模态扩展存在对齐挑战和训练不稳定问题

Method: 提出CoM-DAD框架：1）通过连续潜在扩散过程建模语义流形；2）通过离散吸收扩散过程进行token生成，使用可变速率噪声调度；3）引入随机混合模态传输策略对齐不同模态，无需繁重的对比双编码器

Result: 相比标准掩码建模，该方法表现出优越的稳定性，为可扩展的统一文本-图像生成建立了新范式

Conclusion: CoM-DAD通过分层双过程框架解决了多模态生成中的对齐和稳定性问题，为统一的多模态生成系统提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中由提示引起的幻觉问题，特别是需要利用外部结构化知识进行推理的场景

Method: 扩展链式知识蒸馏方法，加入可编程模块指导知识图探索，将可执行代码嵌入推理提示中，让模型在推理时利用外部结构化知识

Result: 在GPT-4和LLaMA-3.3上的实验显示，代码引导推理显著改善上下文建模并减少提示诱导的幻觉，HIT@1、HIT@3、HIT@5分别提升15.64%、13.38%、13.28%，多个评估设置中得分超过95%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效约束错误推理，同时提高准确性和可解释性，为减少LLM幻觉提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们逐渐意识到LLM在开放和知识密集型任务中的不可靠性，转向检索增强LLM来缓解此问题。但当搜索引擎被触发执行有害任务时，LLM无法控制返回内容，一旦返回内容包含可直接使用的有害信息，LLM的安全防护无法撤回这种暴露。

Method: SearchAttack将有害语义外包给网络搜索，仅保留查询骨架和碎片化线索，并通过结构化模板引导LLM重构检索内容来实现恶意目标。该方法将网络搜索识别为关键攻击面。

Result: 大量实验表明，SearchAttack在攻击检索增强LLM系统方面表现出很强的有效性，可用于负责任的安全漏洞评估。

Conclusion: 网络搜索是检索增强LLM的关键攻击面，SearchAttack通过巧妙利用搜索引擎的不可控性，成功绕过LLM的安全防护，揭示了这类系统的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

It integrates optional large language model (LLM) assistance to support automatic editing of the messages and speakers' descriptions. We demonstrate the platform's utility by showing how tree visualization facilitates the creation of coherent, meaningful conversation threads and how LLM support enhances output quality while reducing human effort. The tool is open-source and designed to promote transparent and reproducible workflows to create multi-party conversations, addressing a lack of resources of this type.

TL;DR: FLEx是一种使用少量解释示例改进语言模型行为的方法，通过聚类选择代表性错误，验证解释有效性，并总结为提示前缀，在不修改模型权重的情况下减少推理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然在各种任务上表现良好，但仍会犯错，且错误往往在相关查询中重复出现。自然语言解释可以帮助纠正这些错误，但在需要专家标注的领域中，大规模收集解释可能不可行。

Method: FLEx方法包含三个步骤：1）使用基于嵌入的聚类选择代表性模型错误；2）验证相关解释是否能纠正这些错误；3）将解释总结为提示前缀，在推理时预置到输入前，引导模型避免类似错误。

Result: 在CounterBench、GSM8K和ReasonIF三个数据集上的评估显示，FLEx始终优于思维链提示，最多能减少CoT剩余错误的83%。

Conclusion: FLEx提供了一种有效的方法，仅需少量解释示例就能显著改进语言模型的行为，且无需修改模型权重，特别适用于需要专家知识的领域。

Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融虚假信息检测缺乏在真实新闻语境下的评估基准，需要捕捉金融新闻中分散线索形成的上下文复杂性，以评估模型在实际场景中的表现。

Method: 在段落级别操作，定义两个互补任务：1) 无参考虚假信息检测；2) 基于比较的诊断（使用原始-扰动输入对）。通过实验评估模型在不同设置下的表现。

Result: 实验显示一致模式：在有比较上下文时性能显著更强，而无参考设置暴露了显著弱点，包括不稳定预测和无效输出增加。这表明当前模型在没有外部基础时难以保持一致的信念状态。

Conclusion: RFC Bench通过揭示这一差距，为研究无参考推理和推进更可靠的金融虚假信息检测提供了结构化测试平台，特别是在真实世界设置中。

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

Result: 在CloudLab简单拓扑上，Polyphony能在10分钟内收敛到严格的SLO目标，在大规模工作负载变化后15分钟内重新稳定，而现有技术无法适应。

Conclusion: Polyphony为网络运营商提供了在分钟级别控制尾部延迟的新方法，补充了拥塞控制和流量工程等现有机制，特别适用于动态变化的数据中心网络环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Polyphony, a system to give network operators a new way to control and reduce the frequency of poor tail latency events in multi-class data center networks, on the time scale of minutes. Polyphony is designed to be complementary to other adaptive mechanisms like congestion control and traffic engineering, but targets different aspects of network operation that have previously been considered static. By contrast to Polyphony, prior model-free optimization methods work best when there are only a few relevant degrees of freedom and where workloads and measurements are stable, assumptions not present in modern data center networks.
  Polyphony develops novel methods for measuring, predicting, and controlling network quality of service metrics for a dynamically changing workload. First, we monitor and aggregate workloads on a network-wide basis; we use the result as input to an approximate counterfactual prediction engine that estimates the effect of potential network configuration changes on network quality of service; we apply the best candidate and repeat in a closed-loop manner aimed at rapidly and stably converging to a configuration that meets operator goals. Using CloudLab on a simple topology, we observe that Polyphony converges to tight SLOs within ten minutes, and re-stabilizes after large workload shifts within fifteen minutes, while the prior state of the art fails to adapt.

Abstract: Resource management is one of the challenges in satellite networks due to their high mobility, wide coverage, long propagation distances, and stringent constraints on energy, communication, and computation resources. Traditional resource allocation approaches rely only on hard and rigid system performance metrics. Meanwhile, incentive mechanisms, which are based on game theory and auction theory, investigate systems from the "economic" perspective in addition to the "system" perspective. Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of incentive mechanism design for resource management in satellite networks. The paper covers key issues in the satellite networks, such as communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy and security, and coordination. We conclude with future research directions including learning-based mechanism design for satellite networks.

Motivation: 工业4.0发展带来动态突发任务和移动设备数量增长两大挑战，现有TSCH网络缺乏系统框架来处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出Monaas架构，包含分层架构平衡全局协调与本地自治、任务驱动调度进行主动资源分配、按需移动资源集成机制。

Result: 在nRF52840硬件测试平台上，高优先级任务在突发流量和链路退化下任务完成率超过98%，而基线方法均低于40%；按需移动资源集成激活服务仅需1.2秒，比SDN快65%以上。

Conclusion: Monaas架构通过系统化设计有效解决了工业物联网中移动节点管理和服务质量保障的挑战，在特定场景中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (> 5.8 s).

Motivation: 在公共保护和灾害救援行动中，特别是在农村或基础设施受损环境中，需要可靠的通信连接。传统地面基础设施不可用时，非地面网络（NTN）特别是无人机（UAV）可作为空中基站提供按需快速连接。

Method: 实现了一个旋翼无人机搭载星链Mini终端的系统，无人机作为Wi-Fi接入点，通过星链星座为地面应急用户提供互联网回传。通过ns-3网络仿真和农村环境的真实飞行实验，评估吞吐量、延迟、覆盖范围和能耗。

Result: 系统在静态和动态飞行条件下能保持约30 Mbps的稳定上行吞吐量，覆盖范围可达约200米，对无人机电池寿命影响最小。实验证明了系统在应急连接中的可行性。

Conclusion: 将商业LEO卫星终端部署在无人机上作为应急连接的实际解决方案是可行的，该系统能在缺乏蜂窝覆盖的环境中提供可靠的互联网连接。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity is critical for Public Protection and Disaster Relief operations, especially in rural or compromised environments where terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. In such scenarios, NTNs, and specifically UAVs, are promising candidates to provide on-demand and rapid connectivity on the ground, serving as aerial base stations. In this paper, we implement a setup in which a rotary-wing UAV, equipped with a Starlink Mini terminal, provides Internet connectivity to an emergency ground user in the absence of cellular coverage via LEO satellites. The UAV functions as a Wi-Fi access point, while backhauling the ground traffic through the Starlink constellation. We evaluate the system via both network simulations in ns-3 and real-world flight experiments in a rural environment, in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, and energy consumption under static and dynamic flight conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable uplink throughput of approximately 30 Mbps up to approximately 200 meters, and with minimal impact on the UAV battery lifetime. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying commercial LEO satellite terminals on UAVs as a practical solution for emergency connectivity.

Abstract: Modern networks carry increasingly diverse and encrypted traffic types that demand classification techniques beyond traditional port-based and payload-based methods. This tutorial provides a practical, end-to-end guide to building machine-learning-based network traffic flow classification systems. We cover the workflow from flow metering and dataset creation, through ground-truth labeling and feature engineering, to leakage-resistant experimental design, model training and evaluation, explainability, and deployment considerations. The tutorial focuses on supervised flow-based classification that remains effective under encryption and provides actionable guidance on algorithm selection, performance metrics, and realistic partitioning strategies, with emphasis on common real-world measurement artifacts and methodological pitfalls. A companion set of five Jupyter notebooks on GitHub implements the data-to-model workflow on real traffic captures, enabling readers to reproduce key steps. The intended audience includes researchers and practitioners with foundational networking knowledge who aim to design and deploy robust traffic classification systems in operational environments.

TL;DR: CellPilot：基于强化学习的自适应小区重选参数调优框架，可显著提升移动网络性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前4G/5G网络共存环境下，移动设备有多个候选小区可选择，但小区重选参数通常基于运营商经验手动配置，难以适应动态网络条件，导致网络性能无法最大化。

Method: 提出名为CellPilot的强化学习框架，通过分析移动网络动态的时空模式，自适应调整小区重选参数，实现自动化配置优化。

Result: 基于真实世界数据的实验表明，即使轻量级RL代理也能比传统启发式重配置方法性能提升高达167%，且能有效泛化到不同网络场景。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能显著改进小区重选配置，提升移动网络性能，为自动化网络优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.

Motivation: 尽管敏捷方法（特别是Scrum）在软件工程教育中被广泛教授，但缺乏关于这些实践在长期运行、学生主导的项目中如何适应学术和混合工作约束的实证证据。

Method: 对8人学生开发团队进行为期一年的案例研究，分析他们如何调整Scrum实践以适应学期节奏、考试、旅行和兼职可用性。使用Discord、Notion和GitHub的定性观察和工件，以及贡献指标和自定义沟通有效性指数（得分：0.76/1.00）。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 轻量级工具协调即使在远程期间也能实现稳定进展；(2) 一周冲刺和灵活仪式有助于协调Scrum与学术义务；(3) 共享动机、角色清晰度和兼容的工作风格与流程机制同等重要。

Conclusion: 研究为在混合、基于项目的学习环境中采用敏捷方法的教师和学生团队提出了实用建议，强调需要调整Scrum实践以适应学术约束，同时保持核心敏捷原则。

Abstract: Agile methods, and Scrum in particular, are widely taught in software engineering education; however, there is limited empirical evidence on how these practices function in long-running, student-led projects under academic and hybrid work constraints. This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics. We propose practical recommendations for instructors and student teams adopting agile methods in hybrid, project-based learning settings.

TL;DR: RepoShapley：基于Shapley边际贡献的仓库级代码补全上下文过滤框架，通过联盟感知的块选择提升补全质量，减少有害上下文和不必要检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仓库级代码补全中，检索增强生成（RAG）面临跨文件证据控制的困难。代码块的效用通常是交互依赖的：有些片段只有在与互补上下文配对时才有帮助，而有些则会在冲突时损害解码过程。

Method: 提出RepoShapley框架，包含ChunkShapley模块：通过(i)单块探测估计带符号的加权效应，(ii)捕捉饱和和干扰的代理游戏，(iii)小检索集的精确Shapley计算，(iv)使用冻结生成器的解码最优联盟选择。通过离散控制令牌将验证的KEEP/DROP决策和检索触发蒸馏到单一模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的实验表明，RepoShapley提高了补全质量，同时减少了有害上下文和不必要的检索。

Conclusion: RepoShapley通过联盟感知的上下文过滤有效解决了仓库级代码补全中的跨文件证据控制问题，为检索增强的代码生成提供了更精确的上下文选择机制。

Abstract: Repository-level code completion benefits from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, controlling cross-file evidence is difficult because chunk utility is often interaction-dependent: some snippets help only when paired with complementary context, while others harm decoding when they conflict. We propose RepoShapley, a coalition-aware context filtering framework supervised by Shapley-style marginal contributions. Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens. Experiments across benchmarks and backbones show that RepoShapley improves completion quality while reducing harmful context and unnecessary retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然传统开源软件已有大量研究，但针对社会公益开源软件（OSS4SG）的社区动态和贡献模式了解甚少，需要研究其使命驱动特性如何影响开发实践。

Method: 对1039个GitHub仓库进行大规模实证研究，包括422个OSS4SG项目和617个传统OSS项目，比较社区结构、贡献者参与度和编码实践。

Result: OSS4SG项目社区更稳定（63.4%粘性），传统OSS项目更具吸引力（75.4%磁性但高流动率）；OSS4SG全年参与度稳定，传统OSS有季节性波动；OSS4SG核心贡献者同时负责代码质量和问题解决，传统OSS则分工明确。

Conclusion: OSS4SG项目的使命驱动特性塑造了独特的社区动态，形成了更稳定、持续的贡献模式，这对确保社会公益项目的可持续性和长期影响具有重要意义。

Abstract: Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects aim to address critical societal challenges, such as healthcare access and community safety. Understanding the community dynamics and contributor patterns in these projects is essential for ensuring their sustainability and long-term impact. However, while extensive research has focused on conventional Open Source Software (OSS), little is known about how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG influences its development practices. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices. Our findings reveal that OSS4SG projects foster significantly more stable and "sticky" (63.4%) communities, whereas conventional OSS projects are more "magnetic" (75.4%), attracting a high turnover of contributors. OSS4SG projects also demonstrate consistent engagement throughout the year, while conventional OSS communities exhibit seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, OSS4SG projects rely heavily on core contributors for both code quality and issue resolution, while conventional OSS projects leverage casual contributors for issue resolution, with core contributors focusing primarily on code quality.

Motivation: 现有基准数据集无法准确评估LLM的代码生成能力，难以识别具体优缺点，阻碍了针对性的模型推理能力提升。需要更精细的评估方法来指导LLM编程能力的改进。

Method: 提出CodeEval多维度基准数据集，模拟学术编程课程的评估过程，包含24个Python编程方面、3个熟练度级别（初级、中级、高级）以及类和函数两种问题类型。同时开发了RunCodeEval开源执行框架，提供完整的评估流水线。

Conclusion: CodeEval和RunCodeEval的组合实现了有针对性的LLM编程能力评估，能够指导模型在代码生成和推理能力方面的改进，填补了现有评估方法的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories. This combination enables targeted evaluation and guides improvements in LLMs' programming proficiencies.

Motivation: 多编程语言代码翻译面临两个关键障碍：1）并行数据稀缺且缺乏可执行测试预言；2）处理不同语言对时存在优化不平衡问题

Method: 提出BootTrans引导方法，利用测试套件的功能不变性和跨语言可移植性，将丰富的枢纽语言单元测试适配为多语言强化学习的通用验证预言。采用包含种子池和探索池的双池架构，通过执行引导的经验收集逐步扩展训练数据。设计语言感知加权机制，根据兄弟语言间的相对性能动态优先处理较难的翻译方向

Result: 在HumanEval-X和TransCoder-Test基准测试中，相比基线LLM在所有翻译方向上均取得显著改进，消融实验验证了引导和加权组件的有效性

Conclusion: BootTrans通过测试套件的跨语言适配和执行引导的引导训练，有效解决了多语言代码翻译中的数据稀缺和优化不平衡问题，为跨语言代码翻译提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Code translation across multiple programming languages is essential yet challenging due to two vital obstacles: scarcity of parallel data paired with executable test oracles, and optimization imbalance when handling diverse language pairs. We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.

TL;DR: Deploy-Master是一个自动化工作流，用于大规模发现、构建、验证和发布开源科学软件，解决了科学工具部署困难的问题，成功为50,112个工具创建了可复现的运行环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源科学软件虽然丰富，但大多数工具难以编译、配置和重用，导致科学计算停留在"小作坊"模式。这种部署瓶颈限制了可复现性、大规模评估以及科学工具与现代AI-for-Science和智能体工作流的实际集成。

Method: Deploy-Master采用一站式智能体工作流，包括：1）基于90+科学工程领域分类的大规模工具发现；2）从50万+公共仓库中筛选出52,550个可执行工具候选；3）构建规范推断；4）基于执行的验证；5）容器化发布。系统通过最小可执行命令验证每个工具，并在SciencePedia中注册供搜索和重用。

Result: 在一天内完成了52,550次构建尝试，成功为50,112个科学工具创建了可复现的运行时环境。每个成功工具都经过验证并注册到SciencePedia中。研究还提供了5万工具规模的部署跟踪数据，揭示了吞吐量、成本分布、失败面和规范不确定性等大规模部署特征。

Conclusion: 科学软件难以操作化的原因在大规模部署中变得明显，需要共享、可观察的执行基础作为可扩展AI-for-Science和智能体科学的基础。Deploy-Master展示了通过自动化工作流解决科学工具部署瓶颈的可行性。

Abstract: Open-source scientific software is abundant, yet most tools remain difficult to compile, configure, and reuse, sustaining a small-workshop mode of scientific computing. This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.
  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.
  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI编码工具越来越多地提交Pull Request，了解测试在这些代理驱动工作流中的表现变得至关重要。需要实证研究AI代理PR中的测试包含情况，为自主软件开发提供基础。

Method: 使用AIDev数据集进行实证研究，分析AI代理PR中测试包含的频率、测试在PR生命周期中的引入时机，比较含测试PR与不含测试PR在规模、处理时间和合并结果上的差异。

Result: 含测试的PR随时间推移更常见，通常规模更大、完成时间更长，但合并率基本相似。不同AI代理在测试采用率和测试代码与生产代码的比例上存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了AI代理Pull Request中测试行为的描述性视图，为未来自主软件开发研究提供了实证基础，揭示了AI代理在测试实践上的差异和趋势。

Abstract: Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs. Our findings provide a descriptive view of testing behavior in agentic pull requests and offer empirical grounding for future studies of autonomous software development.

*Mamdouh Alenezi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出VSM-GQM-DevOps框架，将价值流映射、目标-问题-指标范式与DevOps自动化结合，帮助组织基于数据驱动决策来优先自动化投资，改善交付性能与项目管理成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多组织难以从战略项目管理成果（如减少浪费、交付可预测性、跨团队协调和面向客户的质量）的角度来论证和优先考虑DevOps自动化工作。需要一种系统化的方法来连接自动化投资与可衡量的业务成果。

Method: 提出VSM-GQM-DevOps统一框架：1) 使用价值流映射可视化端到端交付系统并量化延迟、返工和交接；2) 应用目标-问题-指标范式将利益相关者目标转化为最小化、决策相关的测量模型；3) 基于成熟度的DevOps自动化，通过小型可逆干预措施修复经验观察到的瓶颈。

Result: 框架提供了从观察到的问题到目标对齐的问题、指标和自动化候选的可追溯性，并提供了平衡预期影响、置信度和成本的防御性优先级排序方法。同时设计了多站点纵向混合方法验证协议。

Conclusion: 该框架为组织提供了一条经过验证的路径和一套实用工具，能够选择那些可证明改善交付性能和项目管理成果的自动化投资，填补了自动化工作与战略项目管理成果之间的差距。

Abstract: DevOps automation can accelerate software delivery, yet many organizations still struggle to justify and prioritize automation work in terms of strategic project-management outcomes such as waste reduction, delivery predictability, cross-team coordination, and customer-facing quality. This paper presents \textit{VSM--GQM--DevOps}, a unified, traceable framework that integrates (i) Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to visualize the end-to-end delivery system and quantify delays, rework, and handoffs, (ii) the Goal--Question--Metric (GQM) paradigm to translate stakeholder objectives into a minimal, decision-relevant measurement model (combining DORA with project and team outcomes), and (iii) maturity-aligned DevOps automation to remediate empirically observed bottlenecks through small, reversible interventions. The framework operationalizes traceability from observed waste to goal-aligned questions, metrics, and automation candidates, and provides a defensible prioritization approach that balances expected impact, confidence, and cost. We also define a multi-site, longitudinal mixed-method validation protocol that combines telemetry-based quasi-experimental analysis (interrupted time series and, where feasible, controlled rollouts) with qualitative triangulation from interviews and retrospectives. The expected contribution is a validated pathway and a set of practical instruments that enables organizations to select automation investments that demonstrably improve both delivery performance and project-management outcomes.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨机器学习公平性实践在现实数据问题（如错误标签、缺失数据、分布偏移）下的可靠性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在关键社会经济应用中部署时可能产生不公平决策，虽然已有公平性干预措施，但这些实践在现实数据质量问题下的可靠性尚不明确

Method: 论文通过系统分析现有公平性干预措施（包括敏感特征纳入、非敏感属性选择、偏见缓解器应用）在数据质量问题下的表现来评估其可靠性

Result: 研究发现当前公平性实践在存在错误标签、缺失数据或分布偏移时可能无法可靠地实现公平目标，揭示了现有方法的局限性

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒的公平性干预措施，能够应对现实世界数据质量问题，并建立更可靠的公平ML软件开发实践

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly deployed to make critical decisions in socioeconomic applications such as finance, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts? These questions form the core theme of this paper.

*Mohd Ariful Haque,Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个专门测试LLM代码生成中数据转录可靠性的基准，要求模型将高精度十进制常数逐字嵌入Python代码并进行简单聚合计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实软件任务（如加密常数、协议测试向量、白名单、校准表）需要将数据精确转录为代码，这些操作对微小遗漏或改动很敏感，可能导致语法有效但功能错误的程序。现有代码生成评估主要关注算法推理，缺乏对数据完整性的专门测试。

Method: 设计了一个最小化的转录到代码基准：给定高精度十进制常数列表，模型必须生成嵌入这些常数的Python代码并进行简单聚合计算。开发了提示变体、基于精确字符串包含的评估协议，以及分析状态跟踪和长时程生成失败的分析框架。

Result: 该基准作为一个紧凑的压力测试，能够暴露LLM在数据转录可靠性方面的问题，特别是状态跟踪和长时程生成中的失败模式。

Conclusion: 该转录基准补充了现有代码生成评估，专注于数据完整性而非算法推理，有助于识别和解决LLM代码生成中的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Many real-world software tasks require exact transcription of provided data into code, such as cryptographic constants, protocol test vectors, allowlists, and calibration tables. These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoReason：一个基于溯因断言验证的白盒诊断基准，用于评估大语言模型在仓库级代码推理中的逻辑一致性能力，通过执行驱动变异框架消除记忆效应，并建立细粒度诊断系统量化推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展为自主代理，评估其在真实世界大规模、相互依赖的文件系统中保持逻辑一致性的仓库级推理能力变得至关重要。现有基准通常在孤立代码片段和黑盒评估之间波动，缺乏对模型推理过程的深入诊断。

Method: 1) 提出RepoReason基准，以溯因断言验证为核心；2) 采用执行驱动变异框架，利用环境作为语义预言机来重新生成真实状态，消除记忆效应；3) 建立基于动态程序切片的细粒度诊断系统，使用三个正交指标量化推理：ESV（读取负载）、MCL（模拟深度）和DFI（集成宽度）。

Result: 对前沿模型（如Claude-4.5-Sonnet、DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus）的综合评估揭示了普遍的聚合缺陷，其中集成宽度（DFI）成为主要的认知瓶颈。模型在处理跨文件系统集成时表现出显著困难。

Conclusion: RepoReason提供了细粒度的白盒洞察，有助于优化下一代代理式软件工程。研究结果表明，仓库级推理的挑战主要在于跨文件集成能力，而非单纯的代码理解或模拟深度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文首次系统分析代码生成基准测试中编程概念的代表性，发现现有基准测试仅覆盖一半知识单元且分布不均，而真实项目使用所有知识单元且分布均衡。作者提出基于提示的LLM框架生成新任务来重新平衡基准测试，增强后的基准测试显示现有LLM性能被高估12.54-44.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试（如HumanEval、MBPP）评估LLM性能时，缺乏对基准测试中编程概念代表性的系统分析。如果基准测试中的概念不能代表真实项目中的概念使用，评估结果可能不完整且有误导性。

Method: 1) 提出知识单元(KU)作为分析框架，识别20个Python编程语言能力单元；2) 分析HumanEval和MBPP两个基准测试的KU覆盖情况；3) 比较30个真实Python项目的KU使用分布；4) 提出基于提示的LLM框架，生成440个新任务来重新平衡基准测试的KU分布。

Result: 1) 每个基准测试仅覆盖约一半(10个)KU，而真实项目使用所有20个KU；2) 基准测试的KU分布高度偏斜，真实项目分布相对均衡；3) 增强后的基准测试显著改善KU覆盖，分布对齐度提升60%以上；4) 在增强基准测试上，SOTA LLM性能下降12.54-44.82%，表明现有基准测试高估了LLM性能。

Conclusion: 现有代码生成基准测试在编程概念代表性方面存在严重不足，导致对LLM性能的高估。提出的KU分析框架和任务生成方法能构建更现实的评估基准，为改进LLM代码生成能力评估提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude and LLaMA have shown impressive performance in code generation, typically evaluated using benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.
  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.
  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.

TL;DR: LLMs在软件工程团队组建和任务分配中存在系统性偏见，会基于候选人的国家和代词等人口属性产生不公平决策，加剧人口不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地用于提高生产力和支持软件工程任务，但当应用于团队组成和任务分配等社会敏感决策时，会引发公平性担忧。先前研究显示LLMs可能再现刻板印象，但这些分析仍是探索性的，且孤立地考察敏感属性。

Method: 通过分析候选人国家和代词的组合效应，研究LLMs在团队组成和任务分配中的偏见。使用三个LLMs和3,000个模拟决策，考察人口属性如何影响选择可能性和任务分配，即使考虑了专业相关因素。

Result: 发现系统性差异：人口属性显著影响选择可能性和任务分配。任务分布进一步反映了刻板印象，技术性和领导角色在不同群体间分配不均。

Conclusion: LLMs在软件工程环境中加剧了人口不平等，强调了需要公平性评估的重要性。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM越来越多地集成到软件开发工作流中，但它们在结构化、规范驱动的过程中的行为仍然缺乏深入理解。需要实证研究来了解人类干预如何影响LLM辅助代码生成的质量和动态。

Method: 使用CURRANTE（Visual Studio Code扩展）进行人机协同工作流研究。该工具引导开发者通过三个顺序阶段：规范定义、测试生成与细化、函数生成。参与者使用LiveCodeBench数据集解决中等难度问题，工具记录细粒度交互日志、有效性指标（通过率、全通过完成度）、效率指标（通过时间）和迭代行为。

Result: 研究旨在分析人类在规范和测试细化中的干预如何影响LLM生成代码的质量和动态。虽然具体结果尚未公布，但研究设计表明将提供关于人类干预对代码生成效果影响的实证数据。

Conclusion: 研究结果将为设计下一代开发环境提供实证见解，这些环境需要更好地将人类推理与模型驱动的代码生成相结合，优化LLM在软件开发工作流中的集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet their behavior in structured, specification-driven processes remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估小型语言模型(SLMs)在提取机器学习管道阶段方面的能力，以解决现有方法在可扩展性和多样性支持方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从源代码中提取机器学习管道阶段对于深入理解数据科学实践至关重要。然而，机器学习生态系统的快速演进（算法、库、数据集等）带来了多样性挑战。现有方法要么依赖不可扩展的手动标注，要么使用无法很好支持领域多样性的机器学习分类器，因此需要更灵活可靠的解决方案。

Method: 采用验证性研究设计，基于两个具有代表性的参考工作。首先使用Cochran's Q检验比较多个SLM模型，选择最佳模型后通过两个独立的McNemar's检验与参考研究对比。进一步通过Cochran's Q检验分析分类体系定义变化对性能的影响，最后使用Pearson卡方检验进行拟合优度分析，将数据科学实践洞察与先前研究比较。

Result: 研究评估了SLMs在代码理解和分类方面的能力，通过统计检验比较了不同模型的性能，分析了分类体系定义对结果的影响，并将数据科学实践洞察与先前研究进行了对比。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型能够利用其代码理解和分类能力解决机器学习管道阶段提取的挑战，为理解数据科学实践提供了更灵活可靠的方法，有助于推动该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Background: Extracting the stages that structure Machine Learning (ML) pipelines from source code is key for gaining a deeper understanding of data science practices. However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.
  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.
  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis is conducted using Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare our insights on data science practices with those from prior studies.

TL;DR: 提出基于模型的容器安全风险评估方法CSRO，通过整合五个关键领域实现从部署构件到风险级别的自动化、可复现风险识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在OT环境中，容器化应用需要提升权限访问低级网络接口或执行管理任务，这会降低容器默认隔离性并引入重大安全风险。现有方法缺乏可复现性、跨上下文可解释性以及与部署构件的技术集成

Method: 提出模型化方法，实现为容器安全风险本体(CSRO)，整合五个关键领域：对抗行为、上下文假设、攻击场景、风险评估规则和容器安全构件

Result: 在案例研究中评估CSRO，证明从构件到风险级别的端到端形式化风险计算能够实现自动化且可复现的风险识别

Conclusion: CSRO目前专注于技术层面的容器级处理措施，但其模块化和灵活设计为扩展到主机级和组织风险因素提供了坚实基础

Abstract: In operational technology (OT) contexts, containerised applications often require elevated privileges to access low-level network interfaces or perform administrative tasks such as application monitoring. These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管问题跟踪系统被广泛用于软件开发协作，但现有研究主要关注数据分析和自动化任务，缺乏对开发团队实际面临的挑战和问题实践的系统性研究。特别是对某些实践和工作方式（如留空优先级字段）何时构成问题了解甚少。

Method: 采用深度访谈研究，采访了来自不同组织和行业的26位经验丰富的软件工程从业者。询问他们遇到的一般问题，以及文献中讨论的31个ITS异味（潜在问题实践）的相关性。通过主题分析访谈记录来识别模式。

Result: 识别出14个常见问题，包括问题可发现性、僵尸问题、工作流膨胀和缺乏工作流执行等。参与者表示许多ITS异味在实践中并不存在或不构成问题。研究发现ITS问题和异味高度依赖于上下文因素，如ITS配置、工作流阶段和团队规模。

Conclusion: 问题跟踪系统的问题和实践高度依赖上下文，需要更细致的理解。研究提出了工具化解决方案，包括配置、监控和可视化ITS异味，以应对这些挑战。强调了实践导向的研究对理解真实世界软件工程问题的重要性。

Abstract: Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs) enable software developers and managers to collect and resolve issues collaboratively. While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like "priority" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.

TL;DR: 开发基于LLM的预防行为模拟框架，预测传染病爆发期间个体防护行为，在零样本、少样本和跨情境迁移中表现稳健


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传染病爆发早期，个体预防行为是主要防线，但其采纳存在异质性且难以预测，尤其是在数据稀缺、政策快速演变的背景下

Method: 开发LLM预防行为模拟框架，包含静态模块（特定外部情境下的行为强度预测）和动态模块（随时间更新居民感知风险并传播到行为演化），通过结构化提示工程以第一人称视角实现

Result: 框架在北京居民两轮调查数据上表现稳健：零样本预测准确率72.7%，少样本提升至81.8%，跨情境迁移保持77.8%；应用于中国2022年12月政策放松模拟显示行为普遍放松，但排水相关消毒行为反增

Conclusion: LLM模拟框架能有效预测传染病预防行为，低成本、低摩擦行为在外部约束放松后可能持续或强化，提示潜在环境权衡

Abstract: Individual prevention behaviors are a primary line of defense during the early stages of novel infectious disease outbreaks, yet their adoption is heterogeneous and difficult to forecast-especially when empirical data are scarce and epidemic-policy contexts evolve rapidly. To address this gap, we develop an LLM-based prevention-behavior simulation framework that couples (i) a static module for behavior-intensity prediction under a specified external context and (ii) a dynamic module that updates residents' perceived risk over time and propagates these updates into behavior evolution. The model is implemented via structured prompt engineering in a first-person perspective and is evaluated against two rounds of survey data from Beijing residents (R1: December 2020; R2: August 2021) under progressively realistic data-availability settings: zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-context transfer. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare simulated and observed behavior distributions (p > 0.001 as the validity criterion), the framework demonstrates robust performance and improves with limited reference examples; reported predictive accuracy increases from 72.7% (zero-shot) to 81.8% (few-shot), and remains high at 77.8% under transfer to novel contexts. We further apply the framework to simulate behavior changes during China's December 2022 policy relaxation and to stress-test behavioral responses across 120 systematically varied epidemic conditions (R0, CFR, and control-measure tiers). Results indicate broad behavioral loosening under relaxation but a distinctive counter-trend increase in drain-related disinfection, highlighting how low-cost, low-friction behaviors may persist or intensify even when external constraints recede-raising a potential environmental tradeoff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的意见预测模型往往对多数群体表现良好，但对各种边缘化群体存在歧视。这种偏见在社交网络分析公平性研究中日益受到关注，需要研究模型如何歧视特定少数群体，以及能否可靠预测模型对哪些人群表现较差。

Method: 使用NetSense数据集和最先进的CoDiNG意见预测模型，探索三种分类器模型（基于人口统计、基于拓扑结构、混合模型）在评估算法对哪些人群提供不准确预测时的表现。

Result: 通过综合分析实验结果，识别出四种关键的算法偏见模式。研究发现没有单一范式能提供最佳结果，公平导向的社交网络分析需要上下文感知策略。基于人口统计和拓扑结构的分类器各有优劣。

Conclusion: 需要采用多方面的综合方法，结合个体属性和网络结构，这对于减少算法偏见和促进包容性决策至关重要。公平性分析应考虑具体情境，不能依赖单一特征维度。

Abstract: Ways in which people's opinions change are, without a doubt, subject to a rich tapestry of differing influences. Factors that affect how one arrives at an opinion reflect how they have been shaped by their environment throughout their lives, education, material status, what belief systems are they subscribed to, and what socio-economic minorities are they a part of. This already complex system is further expanded by the ever-changing nature of one's social network. It is therefore no surprise that many models have a tendency to perform best for the majority of the population and discriminating those people who are members of various marginalized groups . This bias and the study of how to counter it are subject to a rapidly developing field of Fairness in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The focus of this work is to look into how a state-of-the-art model discriminates certain minority groups and whether it is possible to reliably predict for whom it will perform worse. Moreover, is such prediction possible based solely on one's demographic or topological features? To this end, the NetSense dataset, together with a state-of-the-art CoDiNG model for opinion prediction have been employed. Our work explores how three classifier models (Demography-Based, Topology-Based, and Hybrid) perform when assessing for whom this algorithm will provide inaccurate predictions. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of these experimental results, we identify four key patterns of algorithmic bias. Our findings suggest that no single paradigm provides the best results and that there is a real need for context-aware strategies in fairness-oriented social network analysis. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both individual attributes and network structures, is essential for reducing algorithmic bias and promoting inclusive decision-making.

We conducted the largest randomized controlled trial of hate speech prevention to date: a 20-week messaging campaign on X in Nigeria targeting ethnic hate. 73,136 users who had previously engaged with hate speech were randomly assigned to receive prosocial video messages from Nigerian celebrities. The campaign reduced hate content by 2.5% to 5.5% during treatment, with about 75% of the reduction persisting over the following four months. Reaching a larger share of a user's audience reduced amplification of that user's hate posts among both treated and untreated users, cutting hate reposts by over 50% for the most exposed accounts. Scalable messaging can limit online hate without removing content.

*Jingbin Liu,Xuechun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QZero是一种无需搜索的模型无关强化学习算法，通过自博弈和离策略经验回放学习纳什均衡策略，在有限计算资源下达到AlphaGo水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 围棋长期以来作为人工智能的基准测试，需要复杂的战略推理和长期规划。以往方法如AlphaGo主要依赖基于模型的蒙特卡洛树搜索，本研究旨在探索模型无关强化学习在围棋中的有效性。

Method: QZero是一种基于熵正则化Q学习的模型无关强化学习算法，使用单个Q值网络统一策略评估和改进。算法通过自博弈和离策略经验回放进行训练，无需搜索过程。

Result: QZero在5个月训练时间、仅使用7个GPU的有限计算资源下，达到了与AlphaGo相当的性能水平，证明了模型无关强化学习在围棋中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明模型无关强化学习能够掌握围棋游戏，同时展示了离策略强化学习在解决大规模复杂环境中的可行性，为强化学习在复杂决策问题中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Digital Red Queen算法，利用LLM在Core War游戏中演化对抗性程序，通过持续适应动态目标实现开放式的进化过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM进化框架多为静态优化问题，忽略了真实世界进化过程中的开放对抗性动态（Red Queen效应）。需要研究如何将这种动态对抗性融入LLM进化过程。

Method: 提出Digital Red Queen算法：在Core War游戏中，使用LLM演化汇编式程序（warriors），通过自博弈方式让新程序击败所有先前程序，形成持续适应的进化序列。

Result: 演化出的程序变得越来越通用（相对于人类编写的程序），且独立运行中的行为多样性减少，表明向通用行为策略的收敛压力，类似于自然界的趋同进化。

Conclusion: 从静态目标转向动态Red Queen目标具有潜在价值，Core War可作为研究对抗性适应的丰富沙盒环境，类似的简约自博弈方法可应用于网络安全、药物抗性等实际对抗领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体工作流，将主要任务描述与约束条件解耦，通过定量评分反馈迭代优化提示词，显著提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常生成内容相关但不符合形式约束的输出，传统提示优化方法只关注重述主要任务描述，忽略了作为响应验收标准的细粒度约束条件

Method: 提出新颖的多智能体工作流，将主要任务描述的优化与其约束条件解耦，使用定量评分作为反馈，迭代重写和改进提示词

Result: 评估显示该方法生成的修订提示词在Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型上产生显著更高的遵从度评分

Conclusion: 通过解耦任务描述和约束条件，并使用定量反馈进行迭代优化，可以有效提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从度，解决概念正确但程序错误的问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人工智能代理如何建模内部心理状态对于推进AI中的心智理论至关重要。证据表明自我认知和他人认知存在统一系统，本文通过让强化学习代理在网格世界中推断自身内部状态来探索这种自我意识。

Method: 引入受生物疼痛启发的内省探索组件，使用隐马尔可夫模型从在线观察中推断"疼痛信念"，将该信号整合到主观奖励函数中，建立计算框架比较正常与慢性疼痛感知模型。

Result: 内省代理在总体上显著优于标准基线代理，能够复现复杂的人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 通过计算框架研究自我意识对AI代理学习能力的影响，内省探索方法有效提升了代理性能，为理解AI中的心智理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPGPrompt：一个自动提示系统，将临床实践指南转化为LLM可用的结构化决策树，用于患者病例评估，在专科转诊决策上表现优异，但在多类路径分配上表现有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践指南（CPGs）为患者护理提供循证建议，但将其整合到人工智能中面临挑战。现有方法（如基于规则的系统）存在可解释性差、指南遵循不一致、领域适用性窄等问题。

Method: 开发CPGPrompt系统，将叙述性临床指南转化为结构化决策树，利用大语言模型动态导航这些决策树进行患者病例评估。在三个领域（头痛、腰痛、前列腺癌）生成合成病例，测试不同决策场景。

Result: 二元专科转诊分类在所有领域表现一致强劲（F1：0.85-1.00），召回率高（1.00±0.00）。多类路径分配表现有所下降，存在领域差异：头痛（F1：0.47）、腰痛（F1：0.72）、前列腺癌（F1：0.77）。性能差异反映了各指南的结构特点。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt能够有效将临床指南转化为LLM可用的结构化决策树，在专科转诊决策上表现优异，但在处理否定、时间推理等复杂临床逻辑时仍有改进空间。不同指南的结构特点显著影响系统性能。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

TL;DR: 大型基础模型在医疗AI中表现出色，但无法替代N-of-1试验进行个性化治疗推荐，两者应互补结合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型在医疗AI领域有广泛应用，但能否提供真正个性化的治疗推荐仍存疑问。研究发现存在普遍性悖论：在一个临床研究中表现优异的模型在其他研究中可能表现随机，表明个性化与外部有效性之间存在矛盾。此外还存在隐私-性能悖论、规模-特异性悖论和自动化-同理心悖论等多重矛盾。

Method: 提出混合框架：大型基础模型擅长从多模态数据中快速生成假设，而N-of-1试验（交叉自我实验）是个体因果推断的金标准。结合两者优势：基础模型生成带不确定性估计的干预候选排名，触发后续的N-of-1试验进行因果验证。

Result: 大型基础模型无法替代N-of-1试验，但两者可以互补。基础模型从群体模式中快速生成假设，N-of-1试验为特定个体提供因果验证。混合框架能解决个性化医疗中的多重悖论。

Conclusion: 明确预测与因果之间的界限，并解决个性化医疗中的矛盾悖论，对于负责任地将AI整合到个性化医疗中至关重要。大型基础模型和N-of-1试验应互补结合，共同推动个性化医疗发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Conclusion: PSN框架有效支持持续技能获取，其学习动态与神经网络训练存在结构相似性，为开放世界具身智能提供新方法

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

Motivation: 在实际推理任务中，模型参数通常从数据学习得到，存在不确定性。需要评估推理结果的不确定性程度，但计算WMC方差的可行性尚不清楚

Method: 1) 为结构化d-DNNF推导多项式时间算法计算WMC方差；2) 证明该问题对于结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD是困难的；3) 在贝叶斯网络上应用该方法评估边际概率的方差

Result: 1) 结构化d-DNNF的WMC方差可在多项式时间内计算；2) 结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD的WMC方差计算是困难的；3) 算法可在实际贝叶斯网络上评估边际概率方差，分析参数方差对边际方差的影响

Conclusion: WMC方差计算在不同知识编译形式中具有不同的复杂性特征，为不确定性推理提供了理论基础和实用算法，特别适用于贝叶斯网络推理中的不确定性量化

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于安全规则推理的方法难以确定何种形式的安全推理能有效防御越狱攻击，这很难显式设计或直接获得。

Method: 提出STAR-S框架，将安全规则推理学习整合到自学习循环中：通过安全规则引导生成推理和反思，然后利用微调增强安全推理能力，形成协同循环。

Result: 实验表明STAR-S能有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STAR-S通过自学习循环增强模型的安全规则推理能力，为LLM安全部署提供了有效的防御框架。

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

Motivation: 当前CoT评估方法存在局限，无法区分性能提升是来自真正推理还是单纯token扩展，需要更全面的过程中心评估框架

Method: 提出神经符号框架进行非侵入式、全面的过程中心推理评估，识别四种行为原型并诊断失败模式，分析推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响

Result: 发现扩展token生成不是深度推理的必要条件；混合长短CoT训练会导致过早饱和和崩溃；蒸馏到小模型能复制行为长度但无法复制逻辑效能

Conclusion: 需要超越简单token扩展的评估方法，理解推理过程本质，训练策略和模型容量对逻辑推理能力有重要影响

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强代理训练面临多步推理中信用分配的挑战，现有的LLM奖励模型由于缺乏细粒度、任务特定的评估标准，往往产生噪声和不一致的信号。

Method: 引入SCRIBE框架，在中间抽象层进行干预，基于技能原型库进行奖励建模，将开放式LLM评估转化为约束验证问题，为每个子目标分配相应的原型，提供精确的结构化评估标准。

Result: 在多个推理和工具使用基准测试中达到最先进性能，将Qwen3-4B模型的AIME25准确率从43.3%提升到63.3%，显著提高复杂多轮工具交互的成功率。

Conclusion: SCRIBE与底层工具优化互补，为构建更自主可靠的工具使用代理提供了可扩展的途径，训练动态显示中间层技能掌握先于高层规划行为的出现。

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-Steering方法，通过稀疏自编码器解耦大推理模型的隐藏状态，识别策略特定特征作为控制向量，显著提升推理策略控制效果和任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大推理模型自主选择推理策略常产生低效甚至错误的推理路径，需要开发控制推理策略的方法。现有方法难以控制细粒度推理策略，因为策略概念在隐藏状态中纠缠在一起。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)将策略纠缠的隐藏状态分解为解耦的特征空间。提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：首先通过放大策略特定关键词的logits召回特征，过滤99%以上特征；然后按控制效果对剩余特征排序。将识别出的策略特定特征作为控制向量。

Result: SAE-Steering在控制效果上比现有方法提升超过15%。控制推理策略能将模型从错误路径重定向到正确路径，实现7%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: SAE-Steering通过解耦策略特征和高效识别机制，有效控制大推理模型的推理策略，提高推理可靠性和灵活性，为解决推理策略控制问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

TL;DR: PFUA是一个工具增强的蛋白质推理代理，通过整合领域特定工具而非纯文本推理，在蛋白质功能预测上比纯文本模型平均提升103%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的思维链推理在数学和编程等符号领域有效，但直接应用于蛋白质功能理解效果不佳，因为蛋白质功能预测是知识密集型的科学任务，需要依赖外部生物学先验知识和计算工具，而非纯内部推理。

Method: 提出PFUA（工具增强的蛋白质推理代理），统一问题分解、工具调用和基于证据的答案生成。通过整合领域特定工具产生可验证的中间证据，而非依赖长而无约束的推理轨迹。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PFUA始终优于纯文本推理模型，平均性能提升103%。

Conclusion: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合领域工具而非纯文本推理，PFUA通过工具增强的方法有效解决了这一挑战，为知识密集型科学任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于企业分布式系统标准、形式化方法和行业实践的AI系统架构设计模式，将模式分为LLM代理、Agentic AI和Agentic Communities三个层级，重点关注适用于企业应用的Agentic Communities协调框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和Agentic AI技术的快速发展，需要系统化的架构指导来构建复杂的生产级系统。当前缺乏结合实践指导和形式化验证的架构方法，特别是在多智能体与人类协作的企业环境中。

Conclusion: 该研究为从业者提供了可操作的指导，同时保持了在企业动态多智能体生态系统中部署所需的形式化严谨性，为构建生产级AI系统提供了系统化的架构方法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeRemind：一种通过动态注入安全提醒短语到思维步骤中来增强大型推理模型安全性的解码时防御方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过显式思维步骤取得显著成功，但这些思维步骤可能放大不安全行为，而传统防御机制忽视了LRMs独特的推理动态。研究发现思维步骤中安全提醒短语的出现对确保LRM安全起着关键作用。

Method: 提出SafeRemind方法，在解码时动态注入安全提醒短语到思维步骤中。利用熵触发器在决策锁定点进行干预，将潜在有害轨迹重定向到更安全的结果，无需参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRM和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind显著增强了安全性，提升幅度高达45.5个百分点，同时保持了核心推理效用。

Conclusion: SafeRemind通过动态注入安全提醒短语到思维步骤中，有效增强了大型推理模型的安全性，提供了一种无需参数更新的实用防御方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

### [226] [Sandwich Reasoning: An Answer-Reasoning-Answer Approach for Low-Latency Query Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03672)
*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR) 提出了一种新的推理范式，通过"答案-推理-答案"的三明治结构，在保持推理能力的同时大幅降低延迟，解决了查询纠正中延迟与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查询纠正是现代搜索管道的关键入口，需要在实时延迟约束下保持高准确性。虽然思维链推理能提高准确性，但其延迟过高无法满足实时需求。提前输出答案虽然能降低延迟，但无法利用后续推理来改进准确性。

Method: 提出Sandwich Reasoning方法，采用"答案-推理-答案"范式：先生成初始纠正，然后进行显式推理过程，最后生成最终精炼纠正。设计了基于一致性的强化学习策略，包括专门的一致性奖励来对齐初始和最终纠正，以及基于边际的拒绝采样来优先处理推理能带来最大纠正收益的边界样本。同时构建了高质量的查询纠正数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，SandwichR在准确性上达到了与标准思维链推理相当的最先进水平，同时实现了40-70%的延迟降低，成功解决了在线搜索中的延迟-准确性权衡问题。

Conclusion: SandwichR通过创新的三明治推理结构，在保持推理能力的同时显著降低了延迟，为实时查询纠正提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了传统方法中延迟与准确性的矛盾。

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用LLM生成领域特定启发式函数，将个性化用药规划从最多7种药物扩展到至少28种，显著提升规划覆盖率和时间效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于通用领域描述语言(PDDL)的自动化用药规划系统最多只能处理7种药物，这在临床实践中远远不够，需要扩展系统规模以支持更多药物组合

Method: 通过编程方式定义领域（指定初始状态和状态转移过程），使用LLM生成针对特定问题的启发式函数，结合固定搜索算法(GBFS)进行规划

Result: 实现了显著的改进：规划覆盖率和时间效率大幅提升，能够处理的药物数量从最多7种扩展到至少28种

Conclusion: LLM生成的领域特定启发式函数使个性化用药规划系统更接近实际临床应用，解决了先前系统的规模限制问题

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EntroCoT：通过熵基分割和蒙特卡洛评估自动识别和优化低质量思维链监督数据，提升数学推理微调效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链微调数据存在"答案正确但推理错误"的问题，即最终答案正确但中间步骤存在幻觉、冗余或逻辑错误，这影响了模型学习高质量推理能力

Method: 提出EntroCoT统一框架：1）基于熵的机制在不确定节点分割推理轨迹；2）蒙特卡洛rollout机制评估每个步骤的边际贡献；3）准确筛选欺骗性推理样本，构建高质量数据集

Result: 在数学基准测试上的广泛实验表明，使用EntroCoT构建的子集进行微调，在性能上始终优于全数据集监督的基线方法

Conclusion: EntroCoT能有效识别和优化低质量思维链监督数据，确保每个推理轨迹中的中间步骤都有助于最终答案，从而提升大语言模型的数学推理能力

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

*Muyang Zhao,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ROI-Reasoning框架，通过元认知微调和理性感知强化学习，让LLM在严格全局token约束下进行预算推理，优化计算资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然具备强大推理能力，但无法自动判断不同任务所需的计算量。在实际应用中，计算资源（token数量）通常是有限的，需要智能地分配计算资源以实现整体性能最大化。

Method: 1. 将预算推理问题形式化为有序随机多选择背包问题(OS-MCKP)。2. 提出ROI-Reasoning两阶段框架：第一阶段通过元认知微调让模型预测推理成本和预期效用；第二阶段通过理性感知强化学习在硬token预算下优化序列决策。

Result: 在预算数学推理基准测试中，ROI-Reasoning在严格计算预算下持续提高总体得分，同时显著减少遗憾（regret）。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs引入了预算感知的理性推理能力，使模型能够在有限计算资源下做出智能的解决或跳过决策，实现长期资源分配策略优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Motivation: 可废止推理关注从不完全信息中得出合理结论，KLM框架是其基础理论框架，理性闭包是该框架中最著名的算法之一。现有实现多为命令式方法，本文旨在提供一种声明式的ASP实现方法。

Method: 使用答案集编程（ASP）为理性闭包提供声明式定义，能够从给定知识库自动构建最小排序模型，并支持对指定查询进行推理检查。

Result: 形式化证明了ASP编码的正确性，并通过实验评估与现有命令式实现（InfOCF求解器）比较性能，结果表明ASP方法遵循理性闭包的理论基础且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的ASP方法为理性闭包提供了一种有效的声明式实现，既保持了理论正确性又提升了计算性能，为可废止推理的实际应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Motivation: 为法律专家在刑事审判阶段提供推理支持和可能的判决结果，同时提高司法决策过程的透明度和可解释性

Method: 使用答案集编程（ASP）对意大利刑法典条款进行建模编码，包括"人身犯罪"和财产犯罪；通过归纳逻辑编程系统从案例中学习法律规则；处理编码过程中的矛盾；利用稳定模型的"支持性"提供解释

Result: 开发出能够支持法律推理的工具，可基于先前判决验证模型，为新案件生成可能的判决并提供解释；系统能够处理矛盾并澄清司法决策背后的逻辑

Conclusion: ASP方法能有效建模刑法典并学习法律规则，工具提高了刑事审判的推理支持和决策可解释性，有助于法律专家的工作

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Conclusion: ASP方法为决策树模型解释提供了灵活且全面的解决方案，能够生成多种类型的解释并支持完整枚举，在可解释人工智能领域具有实用价值。

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Motivation: 研究当前ASP求解技术是否能扩展到大规模配置问题，特别是电子系统配置这种包含超过30,000个组件的复杂场景，解决ASP中的"基础化瓶颈"（内存需求随问题规模急剧增加）

Method: 1. 研究增量求解方法（incremental solving approach）在实际应用中的效果；2. 开发约束感知猜测方法（constraint-aware guessing），通过分析基础化过程显著减少内存需求

Result: 增量求解方法在实践中证明有效，但内存需求仍然构成显著限制；新开发的约束感知猜测方法显著减少了内存需求，能够更好地处理大规模配置问题

Conclusion: ASP技术在大规模配置问题中具有潜力，但内存瓶颈是主要限制因素；通过约束感知猜测等创新方法可以显著改善内存效率，推动ASP技术向更大规模问题扩展

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

TL;DR: 当前基于视觉语言模型的智能体在利用生成式世界模型进行未来状态预测时存在困难，表现为很少调用模拟、经常误用预测结果，甚至性能下降，主要瓶颈在于智能体决定何时模拟、如何解释预测结果以及如何将预见整合到下游推理中的能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体面临越来越多需要预测未来状态的任务，生成式世界模型作为外部模拟器提供了一种有前景的解决方案。然而，当前智能体是否能够有效利用这些世界模型作为工具来增强其认知能力，这是一个需要实证研究的问题。

Method: 通过在各种智能体任务和视觉问答任务上进行实证研究，观察智能体在使用世界模型时的行为模式，包括调用模拟的频率、对预测结果的使用方式，以及性能变化。同时进行归因分析，识别智能体与世界模型交互中的主要瓶颈。

Result: 研究发现：1）智能体很少调用模拟（少于1%）；2）经常误用预测结果（约15%）；3）当模拟可用或被强制使用时，性能表现不一致甚至下降（最多5%）。归因分析表明主要瓶颈在于智能体决定何时模拟、如何解释预测结果以及如何将预见整合到下游推理中的能力。

Conclusion: 当前智能体在利用世界模型进行预见性认知方面存在显著挑战，需要开发能够促进与世界模型进行校准、战略性交互的机制，以实现未来智能体系统中更可靠的预见性认知。

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

TL;DR: Trade-R1：一个通过过程级推理验证将可验证奖励与随机金融环境连接起来的RL训练框架，解决金融决策中奖励噪声导致的奖励黑客问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL在数学和编程等可验证奖励领域表现出色，但扩展到金融决策时面临挑战：市场具有随机性，奖励虽然可验证但本质上是噪声的，导致标准RL退化为奖励黑客

Method: 提出Trade-R1框架，通过过程级推理验证连接可验证奖励与随机环境。核心创新是将长金融文档的推理评估转化为结构化RAG任务，构建三角一致性度量（检索证据、推理链、决策之间的两两对齐）作为噪声市场回报的有效性过滤器。探索两种奖励集成策略：固定效应语义奖励（FSR）和动态效应语义奖励（DSR）

Result: 在不同国家资产选择实验中，该范式减少了奖励黑客现象，DSR实现了优越的跨市场泛化能力，同时保持了最高的推理一致性

Conclusion: Trade-R1通过过程级推理验证成功解决了金融决策中RL面临的奖励噪声问题，为随机环境中的RL应用提供了有效框架，DSR策略在泛化能力和推理一致性方面表现最佳

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习增强的推理模型在简单查询上过度冗长，部署成本高，而显式长度惩罚方法存在优化冲突且未深入探究过度思考的生成机制

Method: 提出动态异常截断(DOT)：在训练时选择性抑制冗余标记，仅针对完全正确推理组中的极端长度尾部；结合辅助KL正则化和预测性动态采样确保稳定收敛

Result: 在多个模型规模上显著扩展效率-性能帕累托前沿；在AIME-24上减少78%推理标记使用，同时提升准确率，超越现有高效推理方法

Conclusion: DOT方法有效解决了长度偏移现象，在保持复杂问题长程推理能力的同时，显著降低简单查询的冗余推理，实现了效率与性能的双重提升

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Motivation: ComfyUI平台上的AI生成内容已从单一模型发展为模块化工作流，但大量组件和严格图约束下难以保持长期结构一致性，导致通过率低且工作流质量有限。

Method: 提出了ComfySearch框架，这是一个代理式框架，能够有效探索组件空间，并通过验证引导的工作流构建生成功能性ComfyUI管道。

Result: 实验表明，ComfySearch在复杂创意任务上显著优于现有方法，实现了更高的可执行性（通过）率、更高的解决方案率和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ComfySearch通过验证引导的工作流构建方法，有效解决了ComfyUI平台中组件探索和工作流生成的挑战，为复杂创意任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.
