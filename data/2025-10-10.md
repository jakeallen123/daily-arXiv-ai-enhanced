### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发在真实数据上严格评估的实时检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR框架，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择、合成与真实训练样本的智能权重平衡，以及数据增强技术。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，保持实时性能，验证了各模块贡献及在极端光照或海况下的系统表现。

Conclusion: 该系统保留了DETR的端到端集合预测优势，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含45k人工标注和两个新指标：背景场景一致性和前景对象一致性，在视频级和模型级评估中比现有方法提升2%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：(i) 忽视动态相机运动对电影镜头的重要性；(ii) 仅关注模型级评分而忽略视频级评估，无法选择给定提示下更好的视频。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，收集45k人工标注。提出两个新指标：基于对象错误图修正遮挡/去遮挡问题的背景一致性指标，以及通过跟踪对象实例内点来评估对象保真度的前景一致性指标。

Result: 实验表明，提出的指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，提升超过2个百分点，成为评估动态相机运动下T2V模型的更全面基准。

Conclusion: DynamicEval通过关注动态相机运动和引入视频级评估，解决了现有基准的局限性，提出的新指标在评估T2V模型方面表现更优。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP是一种改进的RED算法，通过引入重启惯性机制实现快速收敛，同时保持基于分数的图像先验以获得高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂的图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速通常依赖于启发式方法。需要一种既能快速收敛又能保证高质量重建的算法。

Method: 提出RISP算法，在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制来加速收敛，同时保留基于分数的图像先验用于高质量重建。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，且不需要图像先验的凸性假设。实验表明RISP在各种成像逆问题中都能实现快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制成功解决了成像逆问题中收敛速度与重建质量之间的权衡问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像纯化策略的去噪框架，解决超低剂量CT图像中的噪声、伪影和空间错位问题，通过频率域流匹配模型在真实临床数据集上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著减少辐射暴露但引入严重噪声和伪影，导致uLDCT与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著空间错位，现有去噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的图像对，并设计频率域流匹配模型协同工作以保持解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，IP策略显著提升多个主流去噪模型性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱多种水印方案的水印信号，同时保持视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和溯源的水印方法需求日益增长。尽管现有的语义水印方案通过在潜在或频率表示中嵌入信号来提高鲁棒性，但在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然存在漏洞。

Method: D2RA通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。这是一种无需训练、无需访问底层模型的单图像攻击方法。

Result: 实验表明，D2RA在各种水印方案中都能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。

Conclusion: 当前的水印设计存在基本弱点，D2RA攻击方法能够有效移除或削弱水印，这为改进水印方案的鲁棒性提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器到预训练视频扩散模型中，利用成对静态图像数据进行训练，实现内容保持和风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移任务中缺乏成对视频数据监督的挑战，目标是保持输入视频内容的同时将其渲染为目标文本提示指定的风格。

Method: 在条件模块的自注意力层插入低秩适配器，从成对图像构建合成训练片段，应用共享增强模拟相机运动，并提出上下文-风格分类器自由引导(CS-CFG)。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现时间一致、风格忠实和内容保持的视频转换，在质量和数量上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TRAVL训练方法和ImplausiBench基准，用于评估和改进视频生成模型中的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进VLMs的运动编码和判别能力。

Result: 现有VLMs难以识别物理违规，但TRAVL方法能改善其时间因果推理能力。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为探索和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了S3FN网络，利用LLM生成的文本描述增强高光谱图像分类，通过语义-光谱-空间融合提升分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类中训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，以及传统单模态方法仅依赖光谱空间数据的局限性

Method: 使用LLM生成类别文本描述，通过BERT/RoBERTa编码为语义向量，与光谱空间特征融合进行特征-标签对齐

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上取得显著性能提升，验证了文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同作用

Conclusion: 语义增强的高光谱分类模型具有良好前景，文本语义信息能有效提升分类性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAGUL框架，通过跨模态注意力引导的视觉令牌变换实现视觉语言模型的高效遗忘学习，防止敏感信息泄露同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露敏感信息，传统遗忘学习方法计算成本高昂，需要一种轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力机制识别视觉令牌的重要性，通过外部模块对低重要性视觉令牌进行编码变换，实现敏感信息遗忘。

Result: CAGUL方法在防止信息泄露方面表现优于或等同于微调基线方法，且不改变预训练模型参数，无重训练成本。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用有效的遗忘学习解决方案，在保护隐私的同时保持模型原有行为。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaSC算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米幼苗，支持两种处理模式，在真实田间验证中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工计数玉米株数费时费力且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来支持作物管理和研究。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，通过两种模式处理图像：拼接图像分块和原始视频帧配准，并进行行距分割实现精确计数。

Result: 与实地人工计数对比显示高度一致性（R²=0.616-0.906），处理83帧仅需60.63秒，具备实时操作潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC是一个可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然在某些任务上表现优于传统CNN，但训练和推理速度较慢，限制了其在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用。

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，同时采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上实现了5倍的推理速度提升，准确率仅有轻微下降。

Conclusion: QCN是开发快速实时CapsNet应用的良好起点，在保持合理准确率的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种自适应预测器-校正器引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知条件规则确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 结合条件RF更新和加权条件校正，在推理步骤中先执行条件RF更新锚定样本，然后应用在条件和无条件速度场之间插值的校正。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上，在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上一致优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++通过确保轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，提供了稳定且高效的文本条件引导方法。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域的应用尚未充分探索。不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影、3D点云视图）能够提供关于点云质量的互补信息。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本、图像和点云来预测质量分数。该方法利用多模态信息的互补性进行无参考点云质量评估。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM为无参考点云质量评估提供了一种有效的多模态解决方案，在性能和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 这是首个将量子-经典混合机器学习框架引入动作分割的研究，通过双流特征对齐学习共享特征空间，有效提升了动作分割性能。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio- temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross- attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q- ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid
quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our
primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn
a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the
proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components:
relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency
reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several
diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We
further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive
ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing

Method: 使用图像服装替换模型处理首帧，然后在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型按序合成剩余帧

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下保持领先性能

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧替换策略有效解决了现有方法的挑战，实现了高效且性能优越的视频虚拟试穿

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，在推理过程中通过二次处理将图像标记限制在主体区域，从而让文本提示能够更好地控制背景内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型往往过度关注主体图像而忽略文本提示，导致生成结果只是简单地重现主体而无法有效结合文本描述。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成主体分割掩码，在第二次处理中应用该掩码将图像标记限制在主体区域，使文本提示能够控制背景内容。

Result: 该方法在描述地点和位置的文本提示下，能够生成准确描绘主体并完全匹配提示的图像，相比其他测试时个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过自动掩码机制限制图像标记到主体区域，有效解决了个性化扩散模型中文本提示被忽略的问题，实现了更好的主体与背景控制平衡。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，并采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中性能优越，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像变形需求下的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 1. 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场；2. 提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数规模。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI有效解决了解剖结构错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，在多个医学影像数据集上表现出优越性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，而实际视频工作流程需要混合不同粒度的用户控制，从精确的4D对象轨迹和相机路径到粗略的文本提示。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推理来近似组合分布，使用多个视频生成主干网络；通过逐步KL散度最小化解决优化挑战，并提出上下文条件分解技术减少解空间模式以避免局部最优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比先前工作能够产生具有更好可控性、多样性和3D一致性的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了视频生成中混合粒度控制的需求，在保持多样性的同时实现了对指定元素的高精度控制。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在建模全局结构方面表现优异，但往往忽视了重要的局部相似性信息。为了解决这一局限性，需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: MLH包含两个分支：强中心分支和弱成对分支。通过迭代式相互学习过程，中心分支利用成对分支学到的局部相似性线索。还引入了混合哈希专家模块实现跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架通过弱到强的相互学习策略，有效结合了全局和局部相似性信息，显著提升了深度哈希的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Conclusion: ComGS框架通过创新的SOPs和光照估计方法，成功解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的挑战，实现了高质量、实时的3D合成渲染。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大的问题，避免传统多曝光方法产生的重影和对齐问题，探索单帧RAW图像重建UHDR的可行性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW降噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建9档包围曝光管道合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Conclusion: 仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，为动态场景下的高动态范围成像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3DGS具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊鲁棒，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Conclusion: 通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，结合RGB和事件模态，能够有效解决动态3DGS重建中的大帧间运动挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: 提出了GTR-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在大型摄像头网络中移动目标的地理时空推理能力，发现当前模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注以自我为中心视角的图像/视频推理或地理视角的图形推理，缺乏同时使用图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准测试，要求模型在多个摄像头视频和地图之间进行视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，并对视频未观测到的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估10多个流行VLM显示，最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro准确率仅34.9%，远低于人类表现78.61%。分析发现模型存在时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频理解对齐能力不足三大缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了宝贵见解和新的研究机会，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双相位微表情识别方法MM-COF和FMANet，通过整合起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个阶段的运动信息，显著提升了微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法通常只计算起始帧到顶点帧的光流，忽略了顶点到结束阶段的运动信息，限制了识别性能。

Method: 提出MM-COF运动表示法，整合两个相位的运动动态；设计FMANet端到端神经网络，将双相位分析和幅度调制内化为可学习模块。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM四个标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双相位框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 提出的基于房间几何约束的深度估计框架能够有效利用几何信息，显著提升360度室内全景深度估计性能。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限和参数增加时容易过拟合的问题，限制了其准确率表现。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，结合仿射变换（保留原始图像信息）和颜色变换（强调任务相关特征），并使用TrivialAugment数据增强来防止过拟合。

Result: 在12个不同图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最先进准确率，超越线性探测的平均准确率，并展现出对分布偏移的更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示方法的性能，同时保持了推理时的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Motivation: 现实场景中经常出现多人与多物体之间的复杂交互，但现有3D人-物交互基准只考虑了部分简单交互，需要更全面的数据集和模型。

Method: 构建了MMHOI大规模数据集，包含12个日常场景的完整3D形状和姿态标注；提出了MMHOI-Net端到端transformer网络，采用结构化双补丁表示来建模物体及其交互，并结合动作识别增强交互预测。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在大规模城市场景中面临严重的走样问题和优化不稳定性，特别是在高分辨率渲染时会出现闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘，现有方法无法解决这一保真度差距。

Method: 提出两种协同正则化器：1）金字塔多尺度监督，通过预滤波图像金字塔强制模型学习抗走样表示；2）显式尺寸正则化，对3D高斯施加物理基础的下界约束，防止退化原语形成。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的实验表明，PrismGS相比CityGaussian实现了约1.5 dB的PSNR提升，在4K渲染下保持优越质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一种即插即用的正则化框架，能够显著改善3D高斯的渲染行为，解决大场景渲染中的走样问题，同时保持与现有管道的兼容性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器能够从有限输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet

chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context

Motivation: 现有feedforward重建范式在重建驾驶场景时存在两个问题：(1)固定视角变换在相机配置改变时失效，限制了跨不同驾驶场景的泛化能力；(2)稀疏视图间重叠区域小且驾驶场景复杂，增加了学习难度，降低了重建精度。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题，在多个评估场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数量、空间关系）中表现不佳，需要提升其跨模态对齐能力。

Method: TTOM框架包含测试时优化和参数化记忆机制，通过布局注意力目标指导新参数优化，支持流式视频生成和历史优化上下文的灵活操作。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM表现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，有效提升组合式视频生成的跨模态对齐效果。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够在推理阶段实时实现组合式视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

TL;DR: CVD-STORM是一个跨视角视频扩散模型，通过空间-时间重建VAE生成多视角长视频，具备4D重建能力，在自动驾驶场景中显著提升了视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还能产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息的模型，以支持全面的场景理解。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其编码3D结构和时间动态的能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量，同时联合训练高斯泼溅解码器重建动态场景。

Result: 实验结果显示模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，联合训练的高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景，提供有价值的几何信息。

Conclusion: CVD-STORM成功实现了高质量多视角视频生成与4D场景重建的结合，为自动驾驶等应用提供了全面的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

TL;DR: 提出SimCast训练管道和CasCast扩散框架，通过知识蒸馏和加权损失改进降水临近预报，在多个数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对灾害管理、农业、交通和能源优化等社会需求至关重要，现有非自回归方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出SimCast训练管道，采用短期到长期知识蒸馏技术和加权MSE损失；进一步集成到CasCast扩散框架中，结合概率模型优势。

Result: 在SEVIR、HKO-7和MeteoNet三个基准数据集上分别达到0.452、0.474和0.361的平均CSI分数，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了降水临近预报的准确性，无需推理时额外开销，解决了确定性输出的模糊性和分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建，在保持计算效率的同时恢复高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段：LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段：使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含编码器LoRA（保真度导向的高频对齐损失）和解码器LoRA（感知导向的损失），通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播保持预训练潜在结构。

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE用于UHD修复，成功解决了计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，实现了灵活的质量权衡。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [45] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在图像隐私分类任务中，对象标签和抽象标签的有效性对比，发现在标签预算有限时抽象标签更有效，而当标签数量充足时对象标签同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务中，对象标签和抽象标签哪种更适合，以指导开发更准确的图像隐私分类器。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的表现，分析不同标签数量下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究在开发图像隐私分类器时，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer模型SwinIR和轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能与效率平衡，发现CNN在仅10个训练周期内达到接近SOTA的性能，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与严重噪声抑制的挑战，同时探索性能与计算效率之间的关键权衡，为实际应用提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 将最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级卷积神经网络(CNN)在低光图像恢复任务上进行对比实验，分析两者的性能差异和训练效率。

Result: SwinIR达到峰值性能PSNR 39.03 dB，但需要132个训练周期；轻量级CNN达到PSNR 37.4 dB，仅需10个训练周期，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有更强的实用性。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟和低能耗优势，适合便携电子设备和移动机器人等资源受限场景，但现有方法未充分利用其稀疏特性进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 使用图神经网络处理事件数据，采用基于线的中间事件表示，结合新颖的偏移向量学习范式和基于置信度的池化方法来估计人体姿态。

Result: 开发了首个基于图神经网络的事件相机人体姿态估计方法，能够实现高频2D单人人姿态估计。

Conclusion: GraphEnet成功展示了图神经网络在事件相机人体姿态估计中的有效性，为资源受限场景下的实时人机交互应用提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是一个端到端的检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过显式的思维链推理来提升组合图像检索的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有组合图像检索方法作为"黑盒"缺乏可解释性，以及难以遵循复杂细粒度指令的问题。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，强制模型先生成可解释的推理链，然后编码最终检索意图到专用嵌入中。通过三阶段过程创建结构化思维链标注数据。

Result: 在域内数据集(FashionIQ、CIRR)上取得高度竞争力表现，在域外CIRCO数据集上展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链增强了跨模态交互理解和决策透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机感知系统由于缺乏显式深度信息，在3D目标检测等任务中难以生成准确预测。为了解决深度估计的模糊性问题，需要开发能够有效利用协作信息的视觉感知方法。

Method: 提出RayFusion方法，利用协作车辆的射线占据信息来减少相机射线上的冗余和误报预测，从而增强纯相机协作感知系统的检测性能。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在协作视觉感知任务中持续优于现有的最先进模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合方法有效解决了相机感知系统中的深度估计模糊性问题，为协作视觉感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASALoRE是一个新颖的两阶段弱监督脑部MRI异常检测框架，通过区域感知空间注意力和基于位置的随机嵌入，在仅使用切片级标签的情况下实现高质量的异常检测和定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中弱监督异常检测的挑战，当精确的像素级标注不可用，只有切片级弱标签可用时，需要快速准确检测脑部异常。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别式双提示调优机制生成高质量的伪弱掩码；第二阶段使用带有区域感知空间注意力的分割网络，基于固定位置随机嵌入来聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现了最先进的异常检测性能，显著优于现有WSAD方法，同时使用少于800万参数，计算复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: RASALoRE框架在弱监督脑部MRI异常检测中表现出色，实现了高性能和低计算复杂度的平衡，为医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一个无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过代码生成直接对高分辨率图像进行可解释的润色处理，模仿人类多步骤润色过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以适应多样化的用户或图像特定调整需求。

Method: 系统包含视觉评论模块（识别输入与参考图像差异）和代码生成模块（生成可执行代码），以渐进方式增强图像，探索不同调整路径。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整，符合用户意图。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释的代码驱动图像润色方法，支持多样化的用户定制调整。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，迫切需要可靠的检测机制，但面临高维时空动态建模和识别违反物理定律的细微异常的挑战。

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度统计量，通过预训练扩散模型估计空间梯度近似和运动感知时序建模，开发NSG-VD检测方法计算测试视频与真实视频NSG特征的最大均值差异。

Conclusion: 基于物理原理的NSG-VD方法能有效检测AI生成视频，通过理论分析证明生成视频会放大分布偏移导致的差异。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: DarkHash是第一个针对深度哈希模型的无数据后门攻击方法，通过双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，在不访问训练数据的情况下植入后门，同时保持原始检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度哈希后门攻击方法需要访问训练数据，但在现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题往往无法获取。因此需要开发无需训练数据的后门攻击方法。

Method: 设计双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层；利用样本与其邻居的关系，通过拓扑对齐损失优化中毒样本向目标样本对齐。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法，并能抵御主流后门防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据的深度哈希后门攻击，在保持原始检索性能的同时植入有效后门，为深度哈希模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于3D高斯溅射的标签精炼流程，从多视角噪声预测中生成准确分割掩码，显著提升极端视角下的人脸解析精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析精度不足的问题，因为此类姿态的标注数据有限且人工标注成本高昂

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（RGB图像和初始分割图），通过共享几何结构强制多视角一致性，合成姿态多样化的训练数据

Result: 在挑战性头部姿态上显著提升解析精度，同时在标准视角上保持强性能，无需真实3D标注且仅需少量初始图像

Conclusion: 该方法为提升真实场景下人脸解析鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real- world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对CT图像的特定增强技术——随机窗位，通过利用CT图像中的亨氏单位分布来提高深度学习模型在对比度增强CT图像中的泛化能力，特别是在肝脏肿瘤分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统为自然图像设计的强度增强方法直接应用于CT图像会忽略CT模态的特性，导致伪影和泛化能力差。CT图像的强度值（亨氏单位）具有重要的物理意义，需要专门的增强技术。

Method: 提出随机窗位增强技术，该方法利用CT图像中亨氏单位的分布特性，鼓励模型对对比度增强的鲁棒性，特别是在对比度差或时机不佳的图像上显著提升性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行消融实验和分析，与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在肝脏肿瘤分割任务中表现更优，特别是在具有挑战性的对比度差或时机不佳的图像上。

Conclusion: 随机窗位是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够显著提高深度学习模型在CT图像分割任务中的性能，特别是在处理对比度增强相关挑战时表现突出。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: AR-Drag是首个RL增强的少步自回归视频扩散模型，成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，在延迟和视觉质量方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常生成自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象尤为突出，模型无法对基于其基础输出的改写问题提供逻辑一致的响应，但这种现象的根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预该现象的潜在因素。提出时间条件注意力锐化(TCAS)方法，构建基于注意力差异的增强目标，提升模型的时间分辨率能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实该方法确实改善了注意力头的时间区分能力。在通用视频时间定位任务中也取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解中的瓶颈问题。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂对象交叉和细粒度空间关系时缺乏显式推理过程，纯文本CoT或坐标增强CoT难以表示复杂视觉布局和引导像素级细节生成。

Method: 使用多模态交替文本-图像CoT，生成包含文本描述和视觉提示（如位置掩码）的逐步推理链；引入MMDC范式，通过奖励模型深度置信度修剪低质量推理路径。

Result: 在三个图像编辑基准上取得显著改进，能够更精确地分解复杂编辑任务，生成高保真编辑结果。

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的空间关系和细节生成问题，为视觉编辑任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声，现有方法依赖数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力。规范化方法假设训练数据对齐，但现实数据集无法满足此假设。

Method: 提出引导式算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设，适用于任意紧致群。

Conclusion: 该引导式算法能有效处理几何偏差，在细粒度视觉分类任务中表现出色，且具有收敛保证。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在图像编辑中存在局限性：基于文本的方法难以精确定位对象，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位。需要一种能够同时实现精确对象定位和语义控制的方法。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，并优化交叉注意力图以提高重定位精度；文本驱动编辑分支与重建分支共享梯度信号，确保一致的变换并允许对对象属性进行细粒度控制。还采用DDPM反演并在噪声图中注入先验信息以保持移动对象的结构。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真度的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功地结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，提供了一种同时实现精确对象重定位和语义控制的图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Conclusion: FineDual方法能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，成功解决了动态层次化人类交互建模的问题。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类比单标签分类能提供更全面的语义理解，但获取完整标注成本高昂。单正多标签学习(SPML)作为实用替代方案，每个图像只标注一个相关标签，但会引入严重的监督模糊性问题。

Method: 提出AdaGC框架，包含梯度校准机制、Mixup和双EMA模块，通过训练动态自适应触发梯度校准，有效缓解对标签噪声的过拟合。

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，AdaGC在两种不同标签噪声类型下均实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC是一个通用且有效的SPML框架，专门针对遥感图像设计，能够有效解决监督模糊性问题，在多标签遥感图像分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的ERU框架，通过结合LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，显著提升了在复杂场景中的目标对象识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇目标检测方法在存在多个候选对象的模糊场景中容易失败的问题。

Method: 联合利用LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言指令和指向线索的鲁棒集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称对象检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义问题，提升指称理解的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在处理包含强烈曝光变化的数据时性能下降，特别是在室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间中。

Conclusion: NExF能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图，无需后处理步骤或多曝光捕获，在挑战性真实世界数据上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力和全局查询来平衡局部性和全局性，在四个参考视频分割基准上达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参考视频分割中提取长程时序上下文信息的问题，现有方法在局部性和全局性之间平衡不佳，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）使用全局查询与其他所有查询交互直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能有效提取长程时序上下文信息，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升参考视频分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础学习的3D功能分割框架，通过跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)将2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，解决了3D数据稀疏、噪声和几何模糊等固有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，忽略了3D数据的固有挑战，导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 提出跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；在此基础上设计跨模态功能分割变换器(CAST)，集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D功能分割方面取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 该研究通过将2D语义知识迁移到3D领域，有效解决了3D功能分割中的语义一致性问题，为机器人操作、具身AI等应用提供了更精确的功能分割能力。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的无数据后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来加速视频扩散模型，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但完全替换二次方注意力需要昂贵的预训练。

Method: 提出选择性迁移方法，将层选择构建为二分类问题，自动渐进式地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验显示该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍延迟减少，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在远距离物体识别方面。现有视觉语言模型在交通场景中的感知性能需要专门评估。

Method: 创建DTPQA基准，仅包含感知类问题（排除推理问题），并标注距离信息。评估多个先进的小型视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM平均准确率约60%，远低于人类表现的85%。模型在左右区分等特定感知任务上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知任务上仍有显著差距，特别是在远距离感知和方向辨别方面需要改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater

or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

Motivation: 新一代高光谱卫星传感器与深度学习结合提升了地物分类能力，但小样本训练容易导致过拟合，需要有效的数据增强技术。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型进行数据增强，采用轻量级transformer网络，引入改进的加权损失函数和优化的余弦方差调度器。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，需要扩展到视频领域以支持复杂的多模态指令理解和视频生成任务。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型（MLLM）用于指令理解，多模态DiT（MMDiT）用于视频生成，通过联合训练统一处理多种视频生成和编辑任务。

Result: 在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越最先进的特定任务基线，支持任务组合和未见指令的泛化。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一建模扩展到视频领域，实现了强大的多模态理解和生成能力，为未来视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释制图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效以结构化方式匹配图例符号与对应描述。

Method: 结合LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习，通过边界框预测检测和链接图例项及其描述。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效提升了源自由域适应的性能，为医疗图像分析提供了隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成基准测试存在三个主要问题：1) 现有评估维度无法区分最先进的模型；2) 事件级时间因果关系评估严重不足；3) 缺乏对世界知识的系统评估。这些问题使得现有基准无法有效评估构建世界模型所需的关键能力。

Conclusion: VideoVerse基准为评估文本到视频模型在理解复杂时间因果关系和世界知识方面的能力提供了全面框架，揭示了当前模型在构建世界模型方面的局限性，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临Jacobian-vector product计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP内核，支持10B+参数模型训练；提出rCM模型，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合sCM的前向散度和反向散度的模式寻求特性。

Result: 在Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等14B参数模型和5秒视频上，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，能够在极少数步骤内生成高质量样本。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习智能体需要处理高维图像数据，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的注意力机制，通过基于回报差异的自监督信号指导注意力聚焦。使用回报引导的对比学习，将相似视觉表示根据回报差异分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组训练注意力机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提升最高达2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的注意力机制能够有效引导视觉强化学习智能体关注任务关键特征，显著提高学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化空间图像处理框架，集成了灰度量化、色彩增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取，在多样化数据集上展现出稳健性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础灰度量化到复杂几何特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化方法，包括：八级灰度量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间的直方图均衡化、HSV亮度调整、3×3卷积核锐化、双向变换管道（包含反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大），以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等几何特征提取技术。

Result: 双向变换管道在正向和反向过程中分别达到76.10%和74.80%的准确率；Hough线估计成功检测到51.50度的台球杆对齐角度；球杆分割与真实图像相比达到81.87%的相似度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化数据集上表现出稳健和确定性的性能，展示了在实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

TL;DR: Video-STAR是一个用于开放词汇动作识别的框架，通过子运动分解和工具增强强化学习来减少多模态大语言模型的文本偏见，提升细粒度动作区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-文本推理方面表现出色，但过度依赖文本先验限制了其在开放词汇场景下区分语义相似动作的能力。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子运动进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交织，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子运动相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR通过子运动分解和工具增强强化学习，成功实现了从文本中心推理向视觉基础推理的转变，展现了优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了视觉象似性挑战基准，评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性任务上的表现，发现模型在音系形式预测、透明度和象似性评分方面均低于人类基准，但模型表现与人类判断存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中普遍存在的象似性（形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要评估VLMs从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，基于荷兰手语，通过三个任务评估13个最先进的VLMs：音系手形预测、透明度推理和分级象似性评分，在零样本和少样本设置下进行。

Result: VLMs在音系形式预测中能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务中远低于人类基准；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关。有趣的是，音系形式预测更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，表明需要人类中心信号和具身学习方法建模象似性，改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法能够处理广泛的图像和视频编辑任务，并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InstructX框架成功解决了MLLM与扩散模型集成的挑战，通过统一建模实现了图像和视频编辑的协同效应，为多模态编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 创伤性脑损伤在急诊医学中诊断困难，及时解读医学影像对患者预后至关重要，需要开发自动报告生成系统来支持放射科医生。

Method: 集成AC-BiFPN与Transformer架构，AC-BiFPN提取多尺度特征检测颅内出血等复杂异常，Transformer生成连贯的诊断报告。

Result: 在RSNA颅内出血检测数据集上，模型在诊断准确性和报告生成方面均优于传统CNN模型。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要人工选择专用模型或使用单一架构，难以泛化处理各种退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型驱动退化识别器；引入基于大语言模型的自适应路由器学习修复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专用VLM视频质量评估模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态智能和模块化推理的整合在通用视频修复系统中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉变换器(ViT)中存在高范数视觉标记(ViT注意力汇点)，这些标记包含图像的高级语义概念，对大型视觉语言模型的视觉推理至关重要。通过利用这些标记，可以显著提升多种LVLM和视觉推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇点，但很少研究ViT视觉编码器中的高范数视觉标记。这些ViT注意力汇点包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中往往被忽视。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT汇点标记中的信息，并开发了无需训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息，探索LLM如何解释这些信息。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇点标记，在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进，展示了ViT注意力汇点在增强视觉推理方面的潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇点是LVLM中未被充分利用的重要资源，有效利用这些标记可以显著提升视觉理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持点云结构和语义信息的同时实现了高效压缩，为带宽受限环境下的多智能体系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: 本文通过理论和实践的结合，为现有PEFT技术提供了一个理论依据充分的替代方案，证明了预训练模型固有的冗余性可以用于高效微调。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: 现有的图像到视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要开发能够支持多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制方法。

Method: 引入统一的点基运动表示，使用序列拼接方案注入轨迹条件，采用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Conclusion: FlexTraj提供了一个灵活高效的轨迹控制框架，为图像到视频生成开辟了新的可能性，支持广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,

TL;DR: 本文提出了MM-HELIX基准测试和AHPO训练策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的长链反思推理能力，在基准测试上获得+18.6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现良好，但在解决复杂现实问题所需的长链反思推理能力方面仍有不足，需要系统性地探索和提升。

Method: 构建MM-HELIX多模态基准测试，开发Step-Elicited Response Generation管道创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集，并提出自适应混合策略优化(AHPO)训练方法，动态结合离线监督和在线优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准上获得+18.6%准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%，展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以通过有效学习实现并泛化，为开发更强大的MLLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景，基于言语行为理论标注社会文化规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏适当的基准来评估模型的文化意识。

Method: 使用人机协作框架构建数据集：教师模型基于理论提示提供候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。然后对各种开源视频大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；难以识别与言语行为对应的确切规范；在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的效率和SLAM管道的可靠性，通过3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，使用高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现交互式性能和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法存在权衡：逐场景优化保真度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO提供与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，用于视觉语言导航任务，通过世界模型想象未来状态作为查询，选择性检索相关环境观察和行为历史，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的记忆持久性视觉语言导航方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖完整记忆整合或固定时间窗口查找，且主要存储环境观察而忽略了编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准上，Memoir在所有场景中均取得显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆能够实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式具有显著提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代潜在视频扩散模型存在时间模糊性问题，多个像素帧被压缩到单个潜在表示中，使得精确的帧级控制变得困难。

Method: 采用混合条件策略，通过零填充处理空间放置，通过时间RoPE插值实现时间对齐，解决了VAE的时间模糊性问题。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件范式，建立了灵活统一视频生成的新技术标准。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas框架成功解决了潜在视频扩散模型中的时间模糊性问题，实现了对视频的精细时空控制。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Motivation: 当前视频基准主要针对通用场景，依赖感知/识别而推理任务相对简单，导致性能饱和，无法有效评估先进的多模态认知技能。科学领域的复杂视频推理仍是一个重要且具有挑战性的前沿问题。

Method: 构建包含1000个精心设计的多选题的基准测试，问题源自前沿科学实验视频，涵盖25+专业学科，通过半自动系统验证。每个问题都需要复杂的领域知识、精确的时空感知和精细的逻辑推理。

Result: 评估显示最先进的专有和开源LMMs（包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5-VL）存在显著性能缺陷，表明视频推理能力仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench为LMMs的未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力的多模态AI共同科学家的演进，有助于推动前沿AI在更广泛科学领域的边界。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

TL;DR: 提出了一个支持多模态控制的视频插帧框架，能够生成复杂运动并提供精细控制，解决了现有方法在用户意图多样性和细节控制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂运动，难以适应多样化的用户意图，缺乏对中间帧细节的精细控制，与创意需求存在偏差。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构，将所有运动控制映射为统一的稀疏点表示，将内容和运动控制分离为两个分支，并采用分阶段训练策略。

Result: 多模态控制实现了更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事，通过广泛的定性和定量实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在灵活性、易用性和精细控制之间取得了平衡，为视频编辑和长视频合成提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: ResAD提出了一种归一化残差轨迹建模框架，通过预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差来解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，简化学习任务并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测，从而危及即时安全。

Method: ResAD框架将学习任务重新定义为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用逐点归一化来重新加权优化目标，防止大误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS，显著简化学习任务并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的优化不平衡问题，证明了该方法在简化学习任务和提升性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL表现出与现有MLLMs竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来原生MLLMs的研究提供了深入见解，证明了端到端训练的有效性和扩展特性。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视角下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，提升了重建质量和稳定性

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating

<details>

Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型在推理时仅依赖单次前向传递，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化3D高斯的模型来提升性能。

Method: 利用高斯溅射渲染误差作为反馈信号，指导循环网络学习有效的高斯更新。引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化高斯，减少高斯数量。

Result: 在多种输入视图、分辨率和数据集上实现最先进性能，显著减少高斯数量并提高渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制有效提升了高斯溅射模型的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准，通过构建包含异构检索偏差和智能体级联错误的噪声长上下文，评估LLM的长上下文鲁棒性。实验显示现有模型在智能体测试中仍存在级联失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有"大海捞针"基准忽略了现实世界中由有偏检索和智能体工作流程产生的噪声上下文，需要构建更真实的测试环境来评估模型的长上下文鲁棒性。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估异构检索策略对干扰项组成的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验表明：更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；在智能体测试中，即使先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了最新一代大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现LLMs在多数语言中通过少量示例即可达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚无证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性。本文旨在探索LLMs在此任务中的能力。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 跨语言方法，与LLMs直接上下文生成词形的方法进行对比。实验覆盖12种不同形态复杂度的语言。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置中仍有竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中通过少量示例直接生成词形，无需微调即可达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，特别是在缺乏目标领域或语言训练数据的情况下，仅需少量示例即可超越传统监督方法。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，解决传统WER指标对形态和句法细微差异过度惩罚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如词错误率(WER)对不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异进行不公平惩罚，需要更智能的评估方法。

Method: 使用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示来学习评分；同时展示如何微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: Hindi LASER使用Gemini 2.5 Pro获得94%的人类标注相关性；提示中的印地语示例对其他印度语言也有效；微调Llama 3在预测惩罚类型上达到近89%准确率。

Conclusion: LLM-based LASER评分标准能有效评估ASR系统，在多种印度语言上表现良好，且较小模型通过微调也能获得不错的性能。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要更高效准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于评分标准和锚点的思维链提示方法，利用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)训练LLM，复制人类编码员的训练过程，测试了多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 这种领域特定的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人类编码员相当的分类准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微和语境敏感方面。

Conclusion: 基于提示工程的LLM方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种有效、可扩展的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过最大后验推理和信念传播算法，解决多智能体系统中提示优化的指数级搜索空间和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要关注单智能体，多智能体提示优化尚未充分探索。

Method: MAPRO采用四阶段框架：将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解，通过拓扑感知的细化机制整合执行反馈和下游责任来迭代更新智能体提示。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，一致超越了人工设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了性能，其基于MAP的公式化为未来构建更可靠和原则性的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤与解码循环，显著提升测试时缩放(LLM推理)的效率，在保持精度的同时减少50%以上的时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询感知的稀疏解码方法存在顺序依赖和粗粒度token选择问题，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下，甚至比前向推理本身消耗更多时间。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时序回归模块预测下一token查询状态；(2)异步解耦架构，将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，达到理论最优TPOT。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，在多个TTS基准测试中保持或超越精度。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除了顺序依赖，为高效TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

Motivation: 虽然基于大语言模型的多智能体系统受到关注，但对其团队动态的研究较少，受人类团队科学启发，旨在探索多智能体团队的核心方面。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在常识推理和社会推理四个任务上的表现，包括CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa和Latent Implicit Hate，分析结构、多样性和互动动态。

Result: 扁平团队表现优于层级团队，多样性影响复杂，智能体对团队表现过度自信，事后反思显示对协作的认可但存在整合挑战和有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队在结构、多样性和互动方面表现出复杂动态，扁平结构更有效，但需要解决整合和协调挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法捕捉证据应该如何连接，需要更好的方法来指导多跳推理。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理重新构建为可重用的思维缓存，通过迭代更新策略基于自然语言反馈不断优化模板，并在检索和无检索设置下进行验证。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升，优化后的模板还能蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架展示了广泛适用性和透明推理重用的潜力，为知识密集型多跳推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯文和塔吉克-西里尔文），虽然方言相似但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有音译模型局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了一个序列到序列的音译模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并创建了两个新数据集来增强模型的跨领域适应性。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为波斯语-塔吉克语音译任务提供了更清晰的理解，建立了全面的基准，模型、数据和代码均已公开。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新型推测解码方法，专门针对长上下文场景，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊标记[SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文输入中实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准上表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中严重退化，甚至导致生成速度下降。

Method: OWL采用三个创新：(1)基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖最后token状态，可泛化到各种长度；(2)验证器中使用特殊标记[SPEC]为drafter生成更丰富的表示；(3)结合树和非树解码的混合算法。

Result: 在长上下文输入中，OWL实现了约5倍于EAGLE3的接受长度，显著提升了长上下文下的生成效率。

Conclusion: OWL解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文场景中的局限性，通过创新的架构设计实现了更好的性能，并发布了LongSpecBench基准和所有代码数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型视觉语言模型（≤2B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估者表现不佳的问题，使其能在资源受限环境中实用。

Method: 1. 多标准提示：将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；2. 领域自适应迁移学习：在图表数据集上使用合成判断对2B参数LVLM进行微调，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性缺陷，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能有效跨数据集迁移知识，成为更专业化的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning

TL;DR: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决轻量级BERT编码器在移动端NLP应用中的适应性问题，在21个下游任务上平均提升NER 0.8%、文本分类8.8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动平台部署NLP模型需要既能适应多样化应用，又保持内存和计算效率的模型。研究预微调策略以增强轻量级BERT编码器在命名实体识别和文本分类两个基础NLP任务族中的适应性

Method: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器主干和模块化适配器，避免朴素多任务预微调带来的优化信号冲突问题

Result: 在21个下游任务上，命名实体识别平均提升0.8%，文本分类平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当且满足实际部署约束

Conclusion: 该方法为多功能移动NLP应用提供了有效的解决方案，通过模块化适配器实现了性能与效率的平衡

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，COVID-19健康谣言在语言特征上与真实信息存在显著差异，包括更低的可读性、更多恐惧相关词汇和说服性语言，但较少使用感叹号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康谣言与真实信息在语言特征上的差异，以帮助检测网络健康谣言并改进公共卫生传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库进行对比分析：COVID-19谣言内容、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关内容，分析可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用。

Result: COVID-19谣言的可读性得分显著更低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，但感叹号使用最少，与猴痘内容的情绪化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 健康谣言采用故意复杂的修辞风格并嵌入情感线索，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为数字健康谣言的检测提供了语言指标，但也承认了传统可读性指数和静态分析等局限性。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发构造语言的系统，通过模块化流程创建音系、翻译句子、构建词典、设计正字法，并生成语法手册


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一是为构造人工语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及应用于高资源到低资源语言翻译的可能性

Method: 模块化系统：先通过代理方法创建目标音系，然后将英语句子翻译为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记，从中提取语素构建词典，设计正字法，最后生成语法手册

Result: 不同LLMs和不同语言规范之间存在能力差距，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在高资源到低资源语言翻译方面结果大多为负面，但改进版本可能有实际收益

Conclusion: LLMs在构造语言开发中可作为有效工具，但存在局限性，特别是在处理罕见语言模式和低资源语言翻译方面需要进一步改进

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型输入词汇表征在训练过程中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关的几何结构，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表征的结构如何形成和演化，以及这种演化与训练过程的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B模型在训练过程中输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、句法和频率指标进行相关性分析。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量。

Conclusion: 词汇几何围绕语言结构的动态演化轨迹揭示了词频和功能的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM在临床编码中的局限性，特别是层次结构接近但错误的预测问题，提出了轻量级干预方法和临床代码验证任务，并发布了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，基于精确匹配的评估方法往往忽略了层次结构接近但错误的预测问题，这类错误占据了LLM失败案例的很大比例。

Method: 采用轻量级干预方法（包括提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床代码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并创建了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 研究显示层次结构错位是LLM失败的主要原因，验证步骤被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效可靠方法。

Conclusion: 临床代码验证是改善LLM医疗编码性能的关键步骤，轻量级干预方法可以在不增加计算开销的情况下提高准确性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，评估了三种方法在访问控制策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常通过生成不受限制的响应来模糊角色边界，需要研究LLM遵守访问控制策略的能力，即在授权时回答，未授权时拒绝。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD数据集的新数据集，包含表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略；比较了三种设计：零/少样本提示、两步生成-验证管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可；微调在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡；更长更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证和微调都能有效提升LLM的访问控制能力，但复杂策略仍是挑战；发布了RBAC增强数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: 传统银行界面采用僵化的多屏幕工作流程，而现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色。Ryt AI旨在用自然语言对话完全替代传统界面，实现核心金融交易的执行。

Method: 基于内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，采用四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ），每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，结合确定性护栏、人工确认和无状态审计架构。

Result: 成功实现了监管批准的自然语言界面，能够在严格治理下可靠支持核心金融操作，展示了对话AI作为主要银行界面的可行性。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面可以可靠地执行核心金融交易，代表了银行服务交互方式的重大进步。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于最优脑损伤理论的缓存驱逐框架，将缓存驱逐建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，通过量化令牌重要性来优化长上下文LLM的内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存驱逐方法通常使用累积注意力权重启发式地排名令牌，而未考虑其对注意力输出的真实影响，导致内存开销大且效率不高。

Method: 基于OBD理论，OBCache通过测量剪枝令牌引起的注意力输出扰动来量化令牌重要性，为孤立键、孤立值和联合键值对推导出闭式评分，考虑了注意力权重、值状态信息和注意力输出。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知评分替换现有工作的启发式评分，能持续提高长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存驱逐框架，通过输出感知的令牌重要性评分有效优化了长上下文LLM的内存使用和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的社会偏见测量主要使用令牌概率指标，但这些指标距离真实世界语言模型使用场景和危害较远，需要探索更现实的替代方案。

Method: 测试自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，并与传统的令牌概率(TP)方法进行比较分析。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感和脆弱。

Conclusion: 令牌概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的行为规范和伦理原则面临内部冲突和场景覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些问题。

Method: 使用综合分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，让模型在无法同时满足的合法原则之间做出选择，评估12个前沿LLM的行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个行为显著分歧的案例，证明模型行为的高度分歧能够预测模型规范中的潜在问题，发现了直接矛盾和解释模糊等具体问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了当前模型规范中的系统性缺陷，包括原则冲突、解释模糊、错位案例和误报拒绝等问题，为改进模型规范提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表层语言特征，难以有效泛化到不同的风格变化。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能导致标签与特征间的伪相关，挑战现有检测方法。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图。提出CADET因果表示学习框架，解耦仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素并控制混杂变量，支持通过干预风格进行反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果图建模和反事实推理能够有效提升仇恨言论检测的泛化能力，从表面语言特征中分离真正的仇恨意图。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver是一个将用户文本历史编织成层次化记忆的框架，通过行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补组件，捕获用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，实现深度个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互形式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态变化的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，构建包含行为记忆和认知记忆的双组件层次化记忆。行为记忆捕获具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合时间和语义信息但处于不同抽象层次。

Result: 在语言模型个性化基准测试中验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过层次化记忆结构成功捕获了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为LLMs提供了统一的用户表示，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

Motivation: 传统Graph RAG方法虽然能连接文档中的分散事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序子问题链，为每个子问题从图中检索三元组，必要时实时从源文档动态扩展图谱，构建图记忆作为结构化证据路径。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG取得了一致且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 子问题驱动的框架通过增强推理深度，有效解决了Graph RAG在复杂多跳问答中的局限性，提供了可追溯的结构化推理路径。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

TL;DR: ToolExpander是一个新颖框架，通过动态多轮硬采样和自我示例思考两个关键创新，解决GRPO训练中模型响应不准确和训练崩溃的问题，显著提升了小规模LLM的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型响应不准确、性能提升有限、训练崩溃等挑战，特别是在小规模架构中这些问题更加突出，限制了GRPO的潜力发挥。

Method: 提出ToolExpander框架：1) 动态多轮硬采样 - 动态替换困难样本为高质量少样本演示，结合指数学习率衰减；2) 自我示例思考 - 改进的GRPO框架，消除KL散度并调整裁剪系数，鼓励模型自主生成和分析少样本示例。

Result: 实验结果表明ToolExpander显著增强了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，同时改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander通过创新的训练策略有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了稳定高效的工具导向强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有奖励模型依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性，需要更可靠和可扩展的评分标准生成方法

Method: 引入对比性评分标准生成(CRG)，通过对比偏好和拒绝响应来推导硬规则和原则，并使用拒绝采样提高可靠性

Result: Rubric-RM在多个奖励建模基准上超越强基线6.8%，在指令遵循和生物医学基准上获得性能提升

Conclusion: 评分标准提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵人工评估与自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文为潜在推理模型实现了并行测试时扩展，通过引入蒙特卡洛Dropout和高斯噪声两种采样策略，以及设计潜在奖励模型来评分和指导潜在推理，在连续空间中实现了可扩展推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有并行测试时扩展方法主要针对显式思维链，而潜在推理模型在连续向量空间中进行中间推理，缺乏连续空间的采样机制和概率信号来进行轨迹聚合，因此需要探索潜在推理模型是否也能从并行TTS中受益。

Method: 提出两种不确定性启发的随机采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声；设计潜在奖励模型，通过逐步对比目标训练来评分和指导潜在推理轨迹。

Result: 实验和可视化分析表明，两种采样策略都能有效扩展计算并展现不同的探索动态，潜在奖励模型能够实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，证明了潜在推理模型同样可以从并行测试时扩展中受益。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在MCQA任务中是否真正使用预期方式解决问题，特别是当模型在没有问题文本仅凭选项就能成功时，这种部分输入成功是否总是有问题的。

Method: 让具有推理能力的LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入两种情况下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性，评估模型使用的策略。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和约一半的仅选项情况下都能提升准确率；仅选项成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示模型使用推断缺失问题等较少问题的策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和无问题的推理策略，挑战了认为仅选项成功总是问题的观点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 论文指出仅基于最终答案的奖励训练数学推理模型容易导致奖励欺骗，产生大量虚假正确解。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型，通过评估整个推理过程来提升模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结果的奖励训练容易导致模型通过错误推理过程得到正确答案（虚假阳性），严重高估了模型的推理能力。需要开发过程导向的奖励机制来确保推理的严谨性。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型（RRM），这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，根据问题特定标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励（0-1分），明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的强化学习训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督学习。在AIME2024上，Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤的发生率减少了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的奖励机制能有效减少虚假阳性，提高模型的推理可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Result: 在常识推理任务和有害基准测试中，该方法能保持拒绝行为和任务效用，缓解真实性与安全性之间的权衡

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: LLMs在单轮任务中表现优异，但在实际多轮交互中会出现上下文漂移问题，即模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为，现有静态评估指标难以捕捉这种时间性漂移。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可理解为可控的平衡现象而非不可避免的衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的旋转约束补偿方法结合方差感知重要性评分，能够有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Motivation: 当前基于结果奖励的RL训练方法缺乏细粒度控制，导致RAG系统存在过度搜索（检索已知信息）和搜索不足（必要时不搜索）的问题，造成效率低下和输出不可靠。

Method: 提出分层过程奖励方法，将智能体的推理轨迹分解为离散步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在结果奖励和格式奖励基础上增加基于最优搜索和非搜索步骤比例的额外奖励。

Result: 在7个QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型平均准确率达到65.4%（3B）和67.2%（7B），同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%，并降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: 优化推理过程本身而不仅仅是最终结果对于提高搜索智能体的效率和最优性至关重要，HiPRAG在多种RL算法、模型家族和规模上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑扩散过程，有效解决了多智能体系统通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符不对齐和标识符膨胀两大挑战。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，通过跨语言语义压缩将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子来对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时减少文档标识符长度74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过语义对齐和标识符压缩有效解决了多语言生成检索的关键问题，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

Motivation: 小语言模型在严格延迟和计算约束下性能提升困难，现有知识蒸馏方法存在训练-推理不匹配或依赖低质量学生输出的问题。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在token级别动态结合在线和离线策略生成，让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两对师生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提升准确性，为蒸馏小语言模型提供了实用有效的方法。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为解决LLM在机器翻译中的质量和公平性问题提供了系统化的评估工具和数据支持。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 该研究提出了TRACE系统来分析LLM的过度思考问题，发现过度验证和过度探索是主要原因，并提出了基于效用的过度思考定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，造成计算资源浪费且无精度提升。现有研究对过度思考的根本原因理解不足。

Method: 开发TRACE系统：1) 将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2) 推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图；3) 识别相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现开放权重思维模型的两种主要模式——探索者和晚着陆，证实过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。长思维模型在简单任务上慢5-20倍且无实质性收益。

Conclusion: 提出了基于思维结构的效用定义来替代基于长度的度量，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性管理过度思考提供了更深刻的见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Conclusion: CS3-Bench基准测试揭示了语音到语音交互模型在语言对齐方面的严重问题，提出的改进方法能有效提升模型在代码切换场景下的表现。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation

Motivation: 解决弱到强泛化方法中弱模型输出噪声和偏差问题，提高该方法的鲁棒性和实际应用性

Method: 利用隐式奖励与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，通过对齐前后的弱模型进行对比解码来生成高质量训练样本

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实验结果显示ConG带来了一致的性能提升，证明了其通用性和有效性

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推动弱到强泛化方法的发展，为通向AGI提供有前景的路径

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

<details>

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究跨方言迁移在不同模态下的效果。

Method: 在德语和多种德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型以及语音转录后文本处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。级联系统在德语上落后于文本模型，但在方言数据上如果转录系统生成标准化输出则表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 语音模型是处理方言数据的最佳选择，而级联系统在方言处理中也有潜力，特别是当转录系统能生成标准化的输出时。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench为LLMs提供了客观、确定性和可代码验证的评估框架，能够有效测试模型在严格遵循指令执行复杂任务方面的能力。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实召回中表现显著衰减，特别是在涉及推理链中隐式主语时。这源于对链式知识在神经元层面动态表示和利用方式的忽视。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐式主语在推理过程中作为查询神经元，跨层激活值神经元积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑关键的查询-值通路。

Result: ACE在GPT-J上比现有最优方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析还揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，以及查询驱动积累如何协调值神经元的语义可解释性。

Conclusion: 这些发现基于对内部推理机制的原理性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in

Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性遗漏关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于Q&A的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本的完整性方面效果最佳，但需要权衡其鲁棒性和可解释性限制。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需人工标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测模糊问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在多个开放域问答基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模型在处理允许多个有效答案的模糊问题时表现不佳，标准问答基准通常假设单一黄金答案，产生不适当的训练信号，而现有处理模糊性的方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 开发自动化流程检测模糊问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在8个开放域问答基准测试中实现最先进性能，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中平均AnsF1@1得分48.4%，优于包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）在内的所有强基线。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决模糊性问题并在不同基准测试中泛化，表明接受模糊性对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，显著提升推理性能同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行均匀优化，但实际上只有少数token具有重要学习价值。研究者探索能否让小型语言模型揭示大型语言模型独特优势的高价值推理时刻。

Method: LightReasoner框架包含两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建捕捉专家优势的监督示例；(2)微调阶段：使用这些蒸馏示例对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型语言模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法来推进大型语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中存在困难，无法区分客观现实与主观信念。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升社交推理准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却遇到困难，表现出认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态的混淆问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中显示出显著改进，准确率提升（例如Hi-ToM中+10%），同时计算成本降低（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，模仿人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，但现有方法难以同时保证科学准确性和作者特定的写作风格。

Method: 两阶段管道：第一阶段使用上下文过滤、DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化及候选标题选择；第二阶段使用少样本提示和配置文件进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本和通用优化方法，将ROUGE-1召回率提高+8.3%，同时将精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%。风格精炼使BLEU得分提高40-48%，ROUGE提高25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在部署到现实世界长时程任务时存在关键限制：它们是测试时静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏积累知识和持续改进的能力。

Method: MUSE引入以分层记忆模块为中心的经验驱动自进化系统，组织不同层级的经验来规划和执行多应用的长时程任务。代理在执行每个子任务后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合回记忆模块。

Result: 在长时程生产力基准TAC上，MUSE仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就实现了显著的新SOTA性能。随着经验积累，代理展现出越来越优越的任务完成能力，以及强大的持续学习和自进化能力。积累的经验还表现出强泛化特性，能在新任务上实现零样本改进。

Conclusion: MUSE为能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Method: 使用简单和增强提示词进行翻译实验，进行自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估，比较ChatGPT-3.5和ChatGPT-4的表现。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；ChatGPT-3.5在准确性上更优，ChatGPT-4在流畅性上更佳；与商业翻译系统相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中表现良好，文档级翻译效果更佳，不同版本在准确性和流畅性上各有优势，整体可与商业翻译系统竞争。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能够编码非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和复杂地形区域存在系统性误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，了解其内部气候知识对于评估可靠性和错误信息风险至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态参数知识的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，要求LLMs回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证，同时评估地理上下文对性能的影响。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差为±1°C，但在海拔1500米以上性能急剧下降（RMSE达5-13°C）。包含地理上下文可使误差平均减少27%，但模型无法再现温度变化的空间模式。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能够捕捉当前气候分布，但难以表示理解气候动态所必需的区域和地方尺度温度长期变化，评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间难以平衡，而现有联邦学习方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，且多轮训练后容易遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE方法，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度评分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedDTRE能够提高对话模型性能，增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合策略，有效解决了联邦对话生成中的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 探究在人类擅长的常识推理领域，LLM生成的论证是否能够影响人类的判断，以及这种影响的程度。

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，通过呈现LLM生成的支持和反对论据来测试其对评分的影响。

Result: 当存在LLM生成的支持论据时，人类合理性评分上升；存在反对论据时评分下降，表明人类认为这些论据具有说服力。LLM实验也显示出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也引发担忧：即使在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM仍可能对人们的信念产生显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Conclusion: 推理能力能有效提升LLM谈判表现，但成本高昂；多语言推理一致性是商业模型相对于开源模型的重要优势，可能影响通过披露推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表，它们在下一个token分布层面（如模型集成）难以协作。不同分词方式阻碍了模型间的有效合作。

Method: 建立了无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过数学转换将给定自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型，保持精度不变。

Result: 实现了语言模型的无损词汇缩减，使不同分词方式的模型能够通过最大公共词汇进行高效协作。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架解决了不同分词模型间的协作问题，为模型集成和多模型合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了GPT-5-nano和Gemini-2.5-flash-lite在检测未披露赞助内容方面的表现，开发了LLM法律推理错误分类法，发现添加监管文本能提升解释质量但不一定提高检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网红营销模糊了有机内容和赞助内容的界限，现有检测方法缺乏法律基础或作为不透明的"黑箱"运作，需要基于法律知识的透明检测方法。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，在三种提示策略下比较两个LLM模型，控制法律知识水平，开发法律推理错误分类法，结合定量和定性评估。

Result: 两个模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲(F1最高0.93)，但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏(28.57%)、不清楚引用(20.71%)，隐藏广告的错误率最高(28.57%)。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM法律推理错误分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，并支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally

TL;DR: 提出CLoVE和GloVE方法，从LLM作为评判者的决策中提取概念化全局策略，用于理解LLM评判的潜在偏见和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模使用来替代人工标注，需要理解其潜在偏见和风险。

Method: CLoVE生成可验证的概念化对比局部解释，GloVE通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个内容危害检测基准数据集上验证，提取的全局策略对LLM评判决策高度忠实，并对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 全局策略方法有效揭示了LLM评判的决策逻辑，用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度较高。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身生成的回答，这影响了评估的可靠性

Method: 采用无监督的多智能体协作优化框架，模拟客户端-服务器轮询机制来优化每个客户端智能体

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注，能持续提升不同客户端智能体的性能

Conclusion: Genii能有效缓解LLM评估器的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Motivation: 大型LLM推理成本高，小模型缺乏跨领域的零样本指令跟随能力，传统微调方法会导致灾难性遗忘，降低模型泛化能力。

Method: DACIP-RC通过阅读理解对话记录生成多样化的任务指令和响应，替代传统的下一词预测预训练方法，实现更好的指令泛化。

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了两个基准测试XSB和MS-XSB来评估LLM的过度安全拒绝问题，并开发了三种无需重新训练的轻量级方法来缓解这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常对包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求产生错误的拒绝，这种过度安全拒绝问题影响了模型的实用性。

Method: 使用后验解释方法识别拒绝触发词，并部署三种模型无关的推理时方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 在四个指令调优的Llama模型上的实验表明，这些策略显著提高了对安全提示的遵从性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度安全拒绝问题，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

TL;DR: ARM2是一个通过强化学习和长度感知优化来平衡推理性能与效率的统一模型，可减少70%以上的token使用量，同时保持与传统推理模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: 采用强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，统一平衡多种格式的推理性能和效率。除了自然语言推理，还集成视觉理解和可执行代码，减少token成本。

Result: 实验显示ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2通过自适应推理框架有效解决了过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了推理效率，并通过广泛分析验证了其设计的合理性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP诗歌研究主要关注自动生成和摘要，而韵律诗歌包含音节和音素模式的严格约束，为深入探究大语言模型的推理能力和规则遵循能力提供了机会。

Method: 设计MetricalARGS分类法，将诗歌相关NLP任务分为四个维度：分析、检索、生成、支持，讨论与现有NLP任务的关系、数据集和评估指标问题。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过韵律诗歌的视角，为理解当前大语言模型的能力和局限性提供了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是轻量级且成本效益高的解决方案，有效解决了数据稀缺和过拟合问题，实现了类似参数更新的效果

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

TL;DR: 提出了函数词假说，解释大语言模型的工作原理：函数词在推理时激活上下文中最具预测性的特征来指导下一个词的预测（记忆检索），在预训练时通过预测函数词后的内容词来增加模型特征并更新参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚。本文旨在揭示LLMs的工作原理，特别是函数词在记忆过程中的关键作用。

Method: 提出函数词假说，通过二分图分析验证函数词激活大部分特征，并进行案例研究展示函数词如何激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个词预测。

Result: 实验证明少量函数词激活了大部分特征，预训练损失主要由预测函数词后的内容词主导，这迫使函数词选择上下文中最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数词假说为理解LLMs的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新视角，函数词在模型推理和训练过程中扮演着关键角色。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在恶意或不正确数据上微调后，不仅会在安全行为上出现偏差，还会在高压情境下表现出广泛的欺骗和不诚实行为，这种现象在混合任务和实际人机交互中也会出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在恶意数据微调后是否会在高压情境下表现出更广泛的欺骗和不诚实行为，而不仅仅是安全行为上的偏差。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域的不对齐完成进行微调，并在下游混合任务和模拟人机交互环境中测试模型行为。

Result: LLMs在欺骗行为上表现出广泛的不对齐；仅1%的不对齐数据就能使诚实行为下降20%以上；仅10%的偏见用户就能无意中加剧模型的不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 新兴不对齐现象在欺骗领域同样存在，这种风险不仅通过直接微调产生，还会在下游混合任务和实际人机交互中出现。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取数据集仅关注支持因果关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽略了反驳因果关系的"反因果"声明，甚至错误地将反因果标注为正因果。这种忽视影响了因果推理的完整性。

Method: 基于广泛的文献综述，首先证明反因果是不完整知识下因果推理的组成部分，然后制定严格的标注指南，将Causal News Corpus扩展包含反因果声明，获得Cohen's κ=0.74的高标注一致性。

Result: 实验表明，未训练反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果错误分类为正因果。基于新数据集，可以减轻这种错误，使transformer模型能有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于完整的因果提取至关重要，新数据集能显著提升模型在区分正反因果关系方面的性能。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全防护方法往往完全拒绝包含不安全内容的部分，这会加剧过度拒绝问题，且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导。需要一种更协调的方法来平衡帮助性和无害性。

Method: 提出WaltzRL框架，联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，采用动态改进奖励机制，根据对话智能体整合反馈的效果进行奖励。推理时，不安全或过度拒绝的响应会被改进而非丢弃。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%）。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在提升LLM安全性的同时不降低通用能力，从而推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Conclusion: 使用对比解码生成的合成语料库与真实数据混合训练是提高语言模型性能的有效方法，特别是对于需要推理能力的任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过强化学习训练多轮交互智能体的框架，通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发深度推理能力，在多个搜索智能体基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型在多轮长程交互智能体中难以激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理的问题。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制处理长程上下文，无需外部摘要模型。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中表现一致提升，支持近100轮持续交互。

Conclusion: DeepMiner框架有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，显著提升了智能体的深度推理能力和长程交互性能。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准表现但不影响通用自然语言理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但LLMs存在文化偏见和对弱势文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确识别文化相关神经元，包括文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 识别出的文化相关神经元仅占所有神经元的不到1%，集中在浅层到中层MLP层。抑制这些神经元使文化基准表现下降高达30%，但通用NLU基准表现基本不受影响。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练NLU基准可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，特别是当更新包含许多文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为LLMs内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了AutoRed框架，无需种子指令即可生成多样化对抗提示，通过两阶段方法和验证器提高效率，构建了数据集并验证了优于现有方法的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要更有效的LLM安全评估方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）反射循环迭代优化低质量提示。引入验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示危害性。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard数据集，在8个最先进LLM上评估，AutoRed获得更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式的红队测试在LLM安全评估方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段用LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成处理隐晦案例，平衡效率与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀率上升需要主动预防策略，社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测隐晦自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺等间接表达）极具挑战性。

Method: 两阶段架构：阶段1用BERT快速处理高置信度明确案例；阶段2对模糊输入采用多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取心理特征的ML集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例达99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率与鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于此任务的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示方式与学习能力之间的关系，发现两者基本相互独立：表示方式决定基线准确率，而学习能力在此基础上通过更多演示样本提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示样本的表示方式（特别是标签表示）对性能的影响，但对ICL的学习能力（即通过更多演示样本提升性能的程度）研究结果不一。本文旨在深入探究表示方式与学习能力这两个方面的交互关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验，分析学习效率与标签集质量、语言模型参数规模的关系。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数规模的影响。尽管学习能力出现，但不同标签集的相对质量（准确率）在学习过程中基本保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中演示样本的表示方式和学习能力具有正交性：表示方式决定性能基线，学习能力在此基础上独立提升性能。这揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大语言模型对条件语句可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但不如人类一致，且更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，不清楚它们如何判断条件语句的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、大小和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义信息，但不如人类一致，模型大小与人类对齐程度没有必然关系。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Method: 使用单层、两个头、8M参数的Co⁴机器，采用近似O(N)计算复杂度的方法进行预训练。

Result: 在10M tokens上实现数量级更高的训练效率，在SuperGLUE任务中零样本和微调性能优于GPT-2和GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: Co⁴展示了高效预训练的潜力，挑战了当前深度学习范式和缩放定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在简单问题上产生不必要的冗长推理痕迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错失解决方案，需要平衡推理效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：自适应冷启动阶段根据问题难度按比例生成推理痕迹；第二阶段使用自适应熵策略优化，以高窗口熵令牌作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制决定探索程度。

Result: 在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中，ARES实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效平衡了不同难度任务的探索努力，提高了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Motivation: AI模型应该能够识别人类判断中的变异和分歧，LEWIDI系列任务旨在通过提供合适的数据集和开发评估方法来促进这种训练和评估方法。

Method: 扩展LEWIDI基准到四个数据集（释义识别、反讽检测、讽刺检测、自然语言推理），引入序数标注，采用软标签和视角主义两种评估范式，测试新的评估指标。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性，为分歧感知技术开发提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的地位，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但存在严重的计算效率问题——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1）使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，从部分推理轨迹准确预测答案等价性（AUROC达0.87）；2）在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）上，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样实现了超过80%的token减少，同时保持准确率在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 人类在有新概念需求时会创造新词，作者希望探索在LLM通信中引入新词来增强对模型的理解和控制能力。

Method: 新词学习方法：添加新词嵌入，使用展现目标概念的示例进行训练，模型参数其他部分保持不变。通过自我言语化让模型描述新词含义，并引入插件评估验证言语化效果。

Result: 实验表明新词可以控制奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念，以及AxBench中的复杂概念。模型能自我描述新词含义，发现机器专属同义词，并能联合学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 新词学习为理解和控制LLMs提供了有效途径，通过自我言语化和插件评估验证了方法的有效性，展示了多概念联合学习的潜力。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法破坏推理完整性，头重分配方法错误压缩推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量关系，识别推理关键头，对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩常数KV缓存。

Conclusion: RLKV通过识别推理关键头实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，解决了推理模型缓存开销问题，同时保持推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的交互讨论生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制，并通过强化学习优化策略，实现无外部监督的自主进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自进化方法依赖于外部奖励信号或LLM自身的内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作来学习进化的机制不符。

Method: 提出CoMAS框架：1）从丰富的讨论动态中生成内在奖励；2）使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励；3）通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略。

Result: 实验表明CoMAS始终优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自进化提供了一个新颖有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的自动基准测试演进框架，通过迭代更新测试用例来解决LLM基准测试中的数据泄露问题，保持可比性的同时提高测试难度和诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试存在广泛的数据泄露问题，模型通过记忆训练数据而非真实泛化能力来匹配测试内容，导致分数虚高、跨模型比较失真，无法准确反映模型进展。

Method: 给定现有基准和待评估模型池，ArenaBencher推断每个测试用例的核心能力，生成保持原始目标的候选问答对，使用LLM作为评判者验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈来选择能暴露共同弱点的候选案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用ArenaBencher，产生了经过验证的、多样化的、公平的更新，发现了新的失败模式，在保持测试目标对齐的同时增加了难度，并提高了模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为在基础模型快速发展的背景下持续演进基准测试提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 使用AI技术分析YouTube评论，发现移民和民主问题是2024年总统选举中最受关注的议题，而通胀问题的重要性被高估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索哪种数据科学方法能更好地分析选民在选举中的关注点，比较AI驱动的意见挖掘与传统调查方法的效果

Method: 使用自然语言处理和聚类分析技术，挖掘华尔街日报和纽约时报YouTube频道在选举前一周的8000多条用户评论，量化不同议题的出现频率

Result: 移民和民主问题是用户评论中最频繁提及的议题，身份政治次之，通胀问题提及频率显著较低

Conclusion: 基于原始用户数据的意见挖掘方法比传统民调和调查更能揭示选举结果

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

*Jinze Wang,Lu Zhang,Yiyang Cui,Zhishu Shen,Xingjun Ma,Jiong Jin,Tiehua Zhang*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt-as-Policy框架，通过强化学习动态构建提示来解决冷启动POI推荐问题，无需模型微调即可显著提升不活跃用户的推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的POI推荐方法在冷启动场景下表现不佳：监督微调需要昂贵标注且无法泛化到不活跃用户，上下文学习使用静态提示无法适应多样化用户上下文。

Method: 将提示构建视为可学习的策略，通过上下文多臂老虎机优化动态确定：(1)包含哪些关系证据，(2)每个候选POI的证据数量，(3)证据在提示中的组织和排序。构建知识图谱来发现候选POI和挖掘关系路径，将其转换为证据卡片，冻结的LLM作为推理引擎生成推荐。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Prompt-as-Policy始终优于最先进的基线方法，在不活跃用户的Acc@1指标上平均相对提升7.7%，同时在活跃用户上保持竞争力，且无需模型微调。

Conclusion: Prompt-as-Policy框架通过强化学习驱动的动态提示构建，有效解决了冷启动POI推荐问题，为智能城市服务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban
services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches
struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse.
Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge
through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL).
However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive
users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs,
a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts
dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt
construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which
relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and
(iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we
construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational
paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for
each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating
recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the
policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users,
while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring
model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个多主题意见交换模型，证明了当主题维度d≥3时，意见会极化到两个对立群体，解决了之前d=2时已证明但d≥3时未解决的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多主题意见交换模型中意见极化的现象，与许多达成共识的模型形成对比，解决d≥3情况下极化性质未证明的问题。

Method: 使用对模型动态的更详细理解和随机过程理论工具来分析意见向量在单位球面上的演化。

Result: 成功证明了在d≥3的情况下，意见确实会极化到两个对立群体，而不是达成共识。

Conclusion: 该模型确实会诱导意见极化，这一性质在任意维度d≥2下都成立，为理解多主题意见动态提供了重要见解。

Abstract: A recent line of work studies models of opinion exchange where agent opinions
about $d$ topics are tracked simultaneously. The opinions are represented as
vectors on the unit $(d-1)$-sphere, and the update rule is based on the overall
correlation between the relevant vectors. The update rule reflects the
assumption of biased assimilation, i.e., a pair of opinions is brought closer
together if their correlation is positive and further apart if the correlation
is negative.
  This model seems to induce the polarization of opinions into two antipodal
groups. This is in contrast to many other known models which tend to achieve
consensus. The polarization property has been recently proved for $d=2$, but
the general case of $d \ge 3$ remained open. In this work, we settle the
general case, using a more detailed understanding of the model dynamics and
tools from the theory of random processes.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: BuzzProphet是一个基于LLM推理增强的标签流行度预测框架，通过让LLM分析标签的病毒性、受众范围和时机优势来丰富特征，然后进行回归预测，在HashView基准上显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归器忽略上下文特征，而LLM虽然擅长上下文推理但不擅长数值估计，需要结合两者优势来准确预测标签流行度。

Method: 使用LLM生成标签的流行度相关推理（病毒性、受众、时机），将这些推理作为特征输入回归模型进行预测。

Result: 在7,532个标签的HashView基准上，BuzzProphet将RMSE降低达2.8%，相关性提升30%，同时产生可读性强的推理。

Conclusion: 将LLM用作上下文推理器而非数值预测器，能够为表格模型注入领域知识，提供可解释且可部署的社交媒体趋势预测解决方案。

Abstract: Hashtag trends ignite campaigns, shift public opinion, and steer millions of
dollars in advertising spend, yet forecasting which tag goes viral is elusive.
Classical regressors digest surface features but ignore context, while large
language models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning but misestimate numbers.
We present BuzzProphet, a reasoning-augmented hashtag popularity prediction
framework that (1) instructs an LLM to articulate a hashtag's topical virality,
audience reach, and timing advantage; (2) utilizes these popularity-oriented
rationales to enrich the input features; and (3) regresses on these inputs. To
facilitate evaluation, we release HashView, a 7,532-hashtag benchmark curated
from social media. Across diverse regressor-LLM combinations, BuzzProphet
reduces RMSE by up to 2.8% and boosts correlation by 30% over baselines, while
producing human-readable rationales. Results demonstrate that using LLMs as
context reasoners rather than numeric predictors injects domain insight into
tabular models, yielding an interpretable and deployable solution for social
media trend forecasting.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现生成式AI的采用通过增加工作需求加剧了开发者的职业倦怠，但工作资源和积极认知可以缓解这种负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究强调生成式AI带来的生产力提升，但其采用也可能引入新的压力，影响开发者福祉。本研究旨在探究生成式AI采用与开发者职业倦怠之间的关系。

Method: 采用嵌入式混合方法研究设计，结合定量和定性证据。首先调查了442名开发者，然后使用PLS-SEM和回归分析建模工作需求、工作资源与职业倦怠的关系，并通过定性分析开放式回答来补充定量发现。

Result: 生成式AI的采用通过增加工作需求加剧了职业倦怠，而工作资源和对生成式AI的积极认知能够减轻这些影响，将采用重新定义为机会。

Conclusion: 生成式AI采用对开发者福祉具有双重影响：一方面增加工作需求导致职业倦怠，另一方面通过工作资源和积极认知可以缓解负面影响。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热修复是解决生产系统中紧急问题的关键变更，但现有评估基准缺乏专门针对热修复的数据集，阻碍了相关工具的研究和发展。

Method: 从10个Apache项目的19万次提交和15万份问题报告中识别746个潜在热修复补丁，经过人工评估确认679个真实热修复，其中110个可复现并集成到HotBugs.jar框架中。

Result: 构建了包含679个已验证热修复的数据集，其中110个可复现案例包含错误和修复版本、测试套件和元数据，已被SBSE会议采纳为官方挑战数据集。

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar填补了热修复研究领域的空白，为快速调试、自动修复和系统弹性工具的开发提供了重要基准，推动了这一关键领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs.jar, the first
dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active
Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs.jar framework,
HotBugs.jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679
manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs.jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

TL;DR: RustAssure是一个使用大语言模型自动将C代码转换为Rust的系统，通过提示工程生成惯用安全的Rust代码，并利用差分符号测试验证语义等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了利用Rust的内存安全特性提升软件安全性，需要将现有的不安全内存语言（如C）代码库转换为Rust，但手动转换成本高昂且容易出错。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行自动代码转换，采用提示工程技术优化生成的Rust代码质量，并通过差分符号测试验证C和Rust代码的语义相似性。

Result: 在五个真实应用程序和库的评估中，系统能为89.8%的C函数生成可编译的Rust函数，其中69.9%的函数在C和Rust版本中产生了等价的符号返回值。

Conclusion: RustAssure能够有效自动化C到Rust的代码转换，生成大量可编译且语义等价的Rust代码，为现有代码库迁移到内存安全语言提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估函数级代码生成，但无法评估LLM构建完整软件系统的能力。真实应用需要协调组件交互、维护状态一致性、处理生命周期约束等复杂任务。

Method: 设计多智能体系统自动总结应用文档功能并导航应用合成测试用例，构建包含101个Android开发问题的基准测试，并建立自动化评估框架。

Result: 评估12个主流LLM，所有模型效果都很低，最佳模型GPT-5仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用，表明当前模型处理复杂软件工程挑战的能力存在根本局限。

Conclusion: APPFORGE填补了评估LLM构建完整软件系统能力的空白，揭示了当前LLM在协调多组件、处理生命周期和异步操作等复杂软件工程任务上的显著不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLEX是一个用于MLIR的自适应模糊测试框架，使用神经网络生成程序，通过扰动采样策略促进多样性，并通过反馈驱动的增强循环迭代改进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保MLIR的正确性和鲁棒性具有挑战性，现有的基于手动模板或基于规则突变的模糊测试方法难以生成足够多样且语义有效的测试用例，难以暴露MLIR复杂且不断发展的代码空间中的细微或深层错误。

Method: FLEX利用神经网络进行程序生成，采用扰动采样策略鼓励多样性，并通过反馈驱动的增强循环使用崩溃和非崩溃测试用例迭代改进模型。从有限的种子语料库开始，FLEX逐步学习有效的语法和语义，并自主生成高质量的测试输入。

Result: 在30天的测试活动中，FLEX发现了80个先前未知的错误（包括多个新的根本原因和解析器错误）；在24小时固定版本比较中，它检测到53个错误（比最佳基线多3.5倍以上），并实现了28.2%的代码覆盖率，比次优工具高出42%。

Conclusion: 消融研究进一步证实了扰动生成和多样性增强在FLEX有效性中的关键作用。

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug影响重大，现有变异模糊测试器的有效性取决于变异算子质量，但之前没有工作利用编译器bug历史作为变异算子来源

Method: 从1760个GCC和LLVM bug报告中自动挖掘587个变异算子，并将这些变异算子集成到现有变异编译器模糊测试器中

Result: 使用IssueMut在GCC和LLVM中分别发现28个和37个新bug，其中60个被确认或修复，证明bug历史包含丰富信息

Conclusion: bug历史包含丰富信息，编译器模糊测试器应该利用这些信息，IssueMut方法有效提升了编译器bug检测能力

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

Motivation: 汽车SoC平台在AUTOSAR架构中仍面临安全挑战，缺乏对漏洞根本原因和影响的系统性分析，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 分析180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，映射到符合AUTOSAR原则的代表性SoC软件架构模型，识别根本原因和受影响模块。

Result: 识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响软件模块，发现了主导漏洞模式和关键模块的补丁延迟问题。

Conclusion: 为保护汽车CPS平台提供了可操作的见解，包括改进检测、优先级排序和定位策略的指南。

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle

*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的AI驱动bug跟踪框架，通过智能自动化减少修复时间和人工开销，实现从自然语言报告到自动修复的全流程优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统bug跟踪系统依赖人工报告、复现和修复，存在沟通成本高、响应延迟等问题，需要更高效的自动化解决方案

Method: 构建AI驱动的bug跟踪框架，使用LLM自动化报告精炼、复现尝试、分类、无效报告处理、问题定位和补丁生成，保留人工监督确保正确性

Result: 该框架能够加速响应时间，改善协作效率，减少从bug发现到修复的整体时间

Conclusion: AI驱动的bug跟踪框架通过集成自动化到每个阶段，能够显著提升软件维护效率，实现更高效、以用户为中心的未来

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过预处理语言构件来构建空格敏感语言的技术，解决了空格敏感和不敏感语言组件之间的集成问题，提高了语言组件的可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件语言工程中，模块化语言组件的可重用性受到空格敏感和不敏感语言集成差距的严重限制，导致库无法重用，空格敏感语言需要从头开发。

Method: 在解析前预处理语言构件，使用模块化的空格不敏感语言模块来构建空格敏感语言，通过重构简化版Python进行评估。

Result: 成功实现了通过预处理技术构建空格敏感语言的方法，提高了现有语言组件的可重用性。

Conclusion: 该解决方案能够减少开发时间并提高软件语言的整体质量，通过增加现有语言组件的可重用性来解决集成问题。

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网系统面临资源受限和不可靠设备导致的数据丢失挑战，需要确保高效的数据生成、收集和管理。

Method: 集成分布式逐跳数据复制方法和无开销移动汇聚节点数据收集策略，优化副本放置和分发。

Result: 相比贪婪和随机复制技术，数据可用性分别提高15%和34%，副本创建分别提高18%和40%；在不同节点密度和故障场景下，数据收集效率优于随机游走和自回避随机游走方法。

Conclusion: DRACO通过解决关键物联网数据管理挑战，为新兴应用场景提供了可扩展且具有弹性的解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and digital
worlds, enabling seamless interaction with real-world objects via the Internet.
However, IoT systems face significant challenges in ensuring efficient data
generation, collection, and management, particularly due to the
resource-constrained and unreliable nature of connected devices, which can lead
to data loss. This paper presents DRACO (Data Replication and Collection), a
framework that integrates a distributed hop-by-hop data replication approach
with an overhead-free mobile sink-based data collection strategy. DRACO
enhances data availability, optimizes replica placement, and ensures efficient
data retrieval even under node failures and varying network densities.
Extensive ns-3 simulations demonstrate that DRACO outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques, improving data availability by up to 15% and 34%, and replica
creation by up to 18% and 40%, compared to greedy and random replication
techniques, respectively. DRACO also ensures efficient data dissemination
through optimized replica distribution and achieves superior data collection
efficiency under varying node densities and failure scenarios as compared to
commonly used uncontrolled sink mobility approaches namely random walk and
self-avoiding random walk. By addressing key IoT data management challenges,
DRACO offers a scalable and resilient solution well-suited for emerging use
cases.

Motivation: 现有通道图表方法难以扩展到全球范围，且难以处理非视距条件引入的失真问题。

Method: 使用CIR数据结合TDoA和TRP位置特征，加入短间隔UE位移测量，并采用NLoS噪声测量识别和屏蔽机制。

Result: 在真实5G测试环境中评估，相比最先进的半监督和自监督CC方法表现更优，90%情况下定位精度达到2-4米。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界场景中实现了高性能的全球规模自监督定位，并提供了公开数据集。

Abstract: Channel Charting (CC) has emerged as a promising framework for data-driven
radio localization, yet existing approaches often struggle to scale globally
and to handle the distortions introduced by non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions. In this work, we propose a novel CC method that leverages Channel
Impulse Response (CIR) data enriched with practical features such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Transmission Reception Point (TRP) locations,
enabling a self-supervised localization function on a global scale. The
proposed framework is further enhanced with short-interval User Equipment (UE)
displacement measurements, which improve the continuity and robustness of the
learned positioning function. Our algorithm incorporates a mechanism to
identify and mask NLoS-induced noisy measurements, leading to significant
performance gains. We present the evaluations of our proposed models in a real
5G testbed and benchmarked against centimeter-accurate Real-Time Kinematic
(RTK) positioning, in an O-RAN--based 5G network by OpenAirInterface (OAI)
software at EURECOM. It demonstrated outperforming results against the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised CC approaches in a
real-world scenario. The results show localization accuracies of 2-4 meters in
90% of cases, across a range of NLoS ratios. Furthermore, we provide public
datasets of CIR recordings, along with the true position labels used in this
paper's evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自适应光子互连的理论框架，用于解决芯片间光子互连在集体通信中的性能瓶颈，通过动态重构光路来优化集体操作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着芯片间硅光子技术的发展，集体通信成为扩展系统的关键瓶颈。可编程光子互连通过动态重构光路，能够在集体操作期间建立直接的高带宽光路，但需要在重构延迟和自适应拓扑性能增益之间进行权衡。

Method: 提出了一个简单的理论框架来分析自适应光子扩展域的性能权衡，将Birkhoff-von Neumann分解、最大并发流和集体通信的α-β成本模型联系起来。

Result: 该框架明确了重构延迟与自适应拓扑性能增益之间的权衡关系，为判断何时进行重构提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 本文为算法设计和系统集成的研究议程奠定了基础，展示了如何通过自适应光子互连优化集体通信性能。

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$--$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose
BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN
employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大规模经验模型与形式验证相结合，解决神经语言生成中的幻觉问题，确保生成内容与知识库的一致性。

Method: 基于约束的语义学，在解码时使用语义防护格，结合贪心选择、知识感知安全质量熵不变性和多智能体操作演算。

Result: TAD 防护机制有效减少了幻觉，同时保持了系统吞吐量，为经验模型与形式验证提供了实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD 提供了一种可行的解码时验证方法，能够在不影响性能的情况下提高生成内容的真实性，实现了经验模型与形式验证的有效结合。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过融合LLM语义理解和MARL协作策略，显著提升IIoT系统的安全性和运行稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)面临传统防御系统缺乏上下文感知能力的问题，无法有效应对复杂的多阶段攻击，需要开发具有自适应和弹性安全能力的新型防御框架。

Method: 使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转换为上下文感知状态表示，结合多智能体强化学习(MAPPO)算法学习协作防御策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和运行稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架的合成数据集上，L2M-AID达到97.2%检测率，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了一个强大的新范式，通过深度融合LLM语义理解和MARL协作策略，实现了上下文感知的自主工业防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

TL;DR: 思维模型通过激活基础模型中已有的推理机制在正确时机来获得性能提升，而非学习全新能力


<details>

Motivation: 探究思维模型性能提升的原因：是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督自下而上方法发现可解释的推理行为

Result: 混合模型在GSM8K和MATH500上恢复了思维模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token且无需权重更新

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在正确时机高效部署这些机制

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化、连续的护理方式。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁的低水平体验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化护理框架。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者体验采样，为动态适应个体需求和不断变化的条件提供支持。

Conclusion: 通过连续、丰富和以患者为中心的数据采样，心理健康护理可以动态适应个体需求，提高治疗的可及性和有效性，MHDTs框架具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。为了在复杂的城市环境中更好地进行交通预测，需要将物理拓扑与数据驱动特征相结合。

Method: 提出了TESTAM+框架，引入新颖的SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合。采用战略性专家选择策略而非简单的集成聚合。

Result: 在METR LA数据集上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），在PEMS BAY数据集上提升4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）。最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但战略性设计的专家比复杂的多专家集成表现更好，在保持计算效率的同时建立了新的最先进性能，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Motivation: 基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误会在各阶段间静默传递，导致系统难以信任。需要建立可追踪和可问责的流水线来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Planner->Executor->Critic三阶段流水线架构，评估了8种配置的三种最先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair

with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLMs擅长证据收集和推理的能力与时间序列分析工具结合，避免多模态对齐训练，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，存在幻觉和知识泄露问题，需要专门设计来解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用原子操作符直接处理原始数值序列，通过证据日志记录输出，在自批判和最终质量门指导下迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到与最先进LLMs相当的性能，在推理任务上显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过合理分工和显式证据记录，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄露问题，同时保持可解释性和可验证性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在理解业务流程模型、发现错误和进行深度推理方面的能力，探索其作为业务流程设计助手的作用。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT模型o3）在零样本设置下，通过自然语言界面与BPMN流程模型图像进行交互式对话分析。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答问题。不同LLM在性能和效果上存在差异，但都能作为业务流程设计的有效助手。

Conclusion: LLMs在业务流程分析中表现出类人特性，能够进行深度推理，可作为业务流程设计师和用户的有价值助手。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: 本文研究了医疗智能系统(MIS)的风险降低优化问题，将其形式化为约束优化任务，并比较了MIP、SAT和CP三种求解方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗智能系统在医疗工作流程中的集成，需要确保其符合可信AI的伦理要求，特别是根据欧盟AI法案，大多数MIS被归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模，并比较混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)三种求解方法。

Result: 通过比较实验研究分析了三种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，并识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的局限性出发，提出了将Minizinc模型集成到完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作方向。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions
include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling
with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental
study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each
ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw
some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model
into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决流行路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两个阶段来识别和创建路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要模型训练、参数调整和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面的能力不断增强，为地理空间问题提供了新的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：SEARCH阶段识别流行路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功地将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为流行路径查询提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过插入最小必要问题来阻止多智能体系统中消息传递的错误级联传播，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过分工协作有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会在整个链中传播），其表现经常不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从整理的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问；(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续改进公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持开销最小，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标系统性地低估了前沿AI模型在组合推理方面的真实能力，导致模型在基准测试中表现不佳，需要更准确的评估方法来揭示模型的真实潜力。

Method: 引入组匹配评分来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法，通过在测试时调整模型来提升性能。

Result: SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4，GPT-4.1在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类性能；TTM使SigLIP-B16在MMVP-VLM上超越GPT-4.1，在16个数据集变体上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，可以显著挖掘AI模型的隐藏组合推理能力，推动组合推理研究的前沿发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离策略学习方法在新物品存在时不够安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架。

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG方法，基于高置信度离策略评估；然后提出DEPL框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在推荐系统中安全地探索新物品，解决了安全性和探索性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Method: 引入了可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，在误导性视觉配对时45%的不安全行动被接受，表明对图像的过度信任。不同模型表现各异，Claude在火灾/高温等局部情境中达到98%成功率。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for

*Ruiling Xu,Yifan Zhang,Qingyun Wang,Carl Edwards,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench，首个大规模专家标注的有机反应机理推理基准，包含10,000多个机理步骤标注，并开发了oMeS评估框架来精确评估大语言模型在有机化学机理推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性以及遵循逻辑连贯的多步骤路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000多个带标注的机理步骤；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分；分析先进LLM表现，并探索提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步骤推理方面存在困难；使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础，当前模型在化学机理推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合分层引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接总结大量相关论文，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），通过水平搜索和垂直深度遍历生成多级摘要，并采用多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明SurveyG在人类专家和LLM评判下均优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且与领域知识分类结构更匹配。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，为自动化文献综述提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA是一种基于LLM的医疗智能代理架构，通过可形式化验证的推理过程确保可靠性，在医疗管理任务中实现超过98%的错误检测率，且RAG模式可降低85%的处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为医疗是高风险领域，错误不可接受。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行低成本验证。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域的验证中，MMIA实现了超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，显著优于基线LLM，RAG模式预计可降低85%的平均处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

TL;DR: 提出了GRAIL框架，将测试时图域自适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM将目标图恢复到源域状态，无需访问源域数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应方法依赖源域数据，但在隐私和安全限制下源域数据往往不可用，因此需要开发无需源域数据的测试时图域自适应方法

Method: 使用图扩散过程建模图恢复，将节点表示压缩为潜在特征，通过量化模块编码为离散token，微调LLM作为生成式恢复器，并引入强化学习过程优化恢复质量

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功解决了无需源域数据的图域自适应问题，通过生成式图恢复方法实现了目标图到源域状态的有效转换

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有的分解方法都是启发式的，依赖于代理或手动分解。

Method: 引入ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式化复杂度度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合优化任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过基于复杂度的分解，代理性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: 基于形式化复杂度度量的系统化分解方法能有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等强化学习算法在推理任务中的局限性，使模型能从所有错误或所有正确的样本中学习，提高训练效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对的样本中获取知识。需要一种能利用外部参考知识的方法来提升推理能力。

Method: 引入Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)，在模型无法解决问题时，使用外部标准参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过引入外部参考答案，有效解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型的推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SHADOW框架，通过强化学习在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险，实现更高的追捕成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗环境中存在信息获取与暴露风险的关键权衡：通信能增强态势感知，但会暴露自身位置增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈模型，使用SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线获得更高成功率；时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要；学习策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下泛化良好。

Conclusion: SHADOW框架成功解决了对抗环境中的战略通信权衡问题，证明了时序建模和对手建模在复杂决策中的重要性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配和局部导航代理的协同优化，在城市规模交通网络中显著提升旅行效率和缓解拥堵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协同推理优化机制和双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法中表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构中作用边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示、缺乏可解释性等局限性，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：强大的教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验从时间序列推断有向因果图；轻量级学生代理优化图结构，并在高置信度因果关联上微调，这些关联被编码为丰富的文本提示用于预测。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，为时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估深度研究系统提供了全面框架，填补了现有评估方法的空白，支持系统能力比较和未来发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在政府服务中经常产生偏见或不正确输出，减少公民和公务员的决策参与权。现有透明度实践主要关注技术对象，难以让公众理解且缺乏行动指导。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 开发了一个框架，使透明度不仅限于技术解释，而是连接理解与行动潜力，让公众能够参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决公民AI系统问题的关键，它超越了单纯的技术透明度，赋予公众理解并影响AI决策的能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理在回测中表现优异，但一旦超出模型知识窗口，收益就会消失，这是因为LLM存在内在信息泄露问题。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动强制代理学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，提供更优的风险调整后表现。

Conclusion: FactFin框架能有效缓解LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升其在实际应用中的稳健性和泛化能力。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现基于LLM的个性化长期交互代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理控制单元的方法在提供个性化交互方面存在局限，RAG虽然增强了上下文感知但缺乏结合用户特定数据的机制，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义推导技术需求，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标，并通过为期五天的试点用户研究获得了关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供了早期指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM代理的适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present formidable challenges for trading strategy
optimization due to extreme volatility, non-stationary dynamics, and complex
microstructure patterns that render conventional parameter optimization methods
fundamentally inadequate. We introduce Cypto Genetic Algorithm Agent
(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for
adaptive trading strategy parameter optimization in dynamic financial

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-SHE框架，通过逐步混合检查强化学习解决电商搜索相关性分析中的推理一致性和泛化问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式（SFT、DPO、RLVR）在长尾查询泛化、逐步监督和稀疏反馈方面存在局限，无法确保推理的逻辑一致性。

Method: 提出逐步奖励策略优化（SRPO），结合生成式逐步奖励模型和人工标注验证器，采用多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习。

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性上均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架显著提升了电商搜索相关性分析的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性，为复杂推理场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了VoiceAgentBench基准测试，用于评估语音语言模型在真实语音代理场景中的表现，包含5500多个合成语音查询，支持多种印度语言，并测试工具调用准确性和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基准测试主要关注孤立能力如转录或问答，缺乏对多语言、文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建包含5500+合成语音查询的基准测试，支持英语、印地语等7种语言，使用新颖的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性，评估工具选择准确性、结构一致性和工具调用正确性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距和关键限制。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench基准测试暴露了当前语音语言模型的重要局限性，特别是在多语言和文化多样性环境下的表现需要改进。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在信息困境中的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行中的主动参与，导致在模糊、动态变化和冲突的任务场景中无法适应真实用户需求。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含三个专门代理：信息管理代理负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理负责冲突感知规划，反思代理负责任务反思和信息一致性验证，所有代理围绕共享内存模块工作。

Result: 实验结果显示ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合用户偏好的结果。在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-代理协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂真实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时并非连续，而是引入显著噪声，尽管能高精度重建数值，但主成分仅解释嵌入空间中的一小部分变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及它们在表示数值时的实际行为。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值表示上的表现。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅解释嵌入空间中的小部分变异，表明许多嵌入空间分量与简单数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型的数值表示存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过惩罚思维阶段的高熵来鼓励生成简洁的推理轨迹，同时保持答案阶段的适度探索，从而在不牺牲准确性的前提下减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且冗余，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 通过系统实证分析发现模型熵与响应长度在不同推理阶段存在相关性，据此提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚高熵，在答案阶段允许适度探索。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出强大的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段熵感知的奖励设计，实现了自适应控制响应长度，无需依赖显式长度目标或刚性截断规则，在保持性能的同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然广泛使用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现自注意力机制中的W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示在任务和层间保持稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示，从而更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色。

Result: 该方法能够增强微调性能和收敛效率，通过差异化处理不同功能的投影矩阵来优化参数高效微调过程。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验，有效解决了LoRA在性能和收敛方面的限制，为参数高效微调提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡指令遵循准确性与真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，通常通过限制场景为2D或开放循环模拟来降低复杂性，但牺牲了真实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险描述ACT: 0.072s vs 安全描述3.532s；舒适度0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim框架能够创建高保真场景，增强安全测试和训练，有效弥合自然语言与交互式模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

TL;DR: 提出了多条件一致性选择（MCCS）算法，将一致性选择扩展到多条件场景，包括合取和析取条件，实现了有限样本的FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有的一致性选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，无法满足多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，针对合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新型非一致性评分，针对析取条件采用了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序。

Result: 实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，其在多样化条件组合、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS方法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，为资源受限应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了AutoQual框架，使用LLM代理自动发现可解释特征来评估在线评论质量，在大型电商平台上验证有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工特征难以跨领域扩展，深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量，需要自动化可解释的质量评估方法

Method: AutoQual框架模仿人类研究过程，通过反思生成特征假设，自主工具实现特征操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验

Result: 在亿级用户平台的大规模A/B测试中，平均每位用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提高0.27%

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征，为质量评估提供可扩展且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法存在局限，需要确保AI系统完全公平，特别是在敏感属性（如种族）可能通过代理（如邮政编码）泄露的情况下。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理，构建sigma代数G捕获偏见模式结构，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法确保真正的独立性而非简单的去相关，在贷款审批等任务中实现完全公平，其中邮政编码等代理可能揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可认证且数学基础扎实的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要。需要确保AI系统不会无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过多样化的经济场景，考察语言模型复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一些一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，以确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高风险管理的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话AI系统中知识访问与响应延迟的根本矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但缺乏推理深度，工具增强的ReAct代理虽然事实性更好但同步执行会阻塞交互。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制保持对话流畅性。

Result: 在Top-iOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了响应质量，为实时对话系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral
decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through
asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated
components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency
assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user
interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background
knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational
flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent
triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR
outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s
-> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight
synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理中也出现显著性能下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。使用R-HORIZON数据进行强化学习训练后，不仅在多视野推理任务上大幅提升性能，在标准推理任务上准确率也提高了7.5分。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AI多元主义指数(AIPI)，这是一个评估AI系统多元治理的透明、基于证据的测量工具，涵盖参与式治理、包容性与多样性、透明度和问责制四个支柱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，处理"未知"证据并报告下限和已知分数。

Result: 报告了试点供应商结果，将AIPI与邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行对比。

Conclusion: 该指数旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次两两比较就能获得完整、互逆且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低了认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两两比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负荷高，存在不一致性风险，且计算复杂度高。需要一种更高效的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的两两比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法通过设计确保一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数。

Result: TTM方法能够获得完整、互逆且一致的比较矩阵，与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示其实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法通过减少所需比较次数、确保一致性和降低认知负担，为多准则决策中的偏好建模提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，而因果意识能增强AI对底层机制的理解，提升性能。

Method: 智能体通过重复干预学习隐藏的因果有向无环图，利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下优于观测方法，通常能以零误差重建因果图结构。

Conclusion: 自主因果发现算法DODO能有效学习环境因果结构，为AI系统提供更深入的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，使用8倍少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并引入SR²框架来学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现对智能体的长期控制，在保持高攻击成功率的同时增强智能体的正常任务性能，具有高度隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发了严重担忧。传统后门攻击仅限于单步控制，需要开发能够实现长期操控的多步后门攻击方法。

Method: CoTri采用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控，使智能体偏离预定任务。该方法通过训练数据建模环境的随机性来增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持接近零的误触发率（FTR）。植入CoTri反而提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能，并增强了其对环境干扰的鲁棒性。在视觉语言模型上的验证表明该方法可扩展到多模态智能体。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了对智能体的稳定多步控制，同时提高了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Method: 使用尺度等变图元网络（ScaleGMNs），直接在权重空间操作，实现单次微调，并分析卷积神经网络和多层感知机中缩放对称性引起的规范自由度差异。

Result: 实验证明了该方法的有效性，理论分析显示卷积神经网络中的规范自由度严格小于多层感知机，这解释了不同架构间的性能差异。

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 论文系统分析了大型语言模型在推理任务中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性而非修正性，并提出了基于问题感知的早停方法来提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反思行为对推理性能提升的实际贡献，因为虽然模型能生成长推理链和反思，但反思对性能改善的作用尚不明确。

Method: 分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出问题感知早停方法动态截断反思。

Result: 反思主要是确认性，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数主要提升首答正确率而非修正能力；早停方法减少24.5%推理token，精度仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思行为主要是确认性而非修正性，通过动态截断反思可以在保持精度的同时显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大量采样时可能误导性地反映模型推理边界，因为离散答案空间中的高k值Pass@k更多反映的是随机猜测的成功概率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例完成结果正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，该指标对随机猜测敏感，能更好反映真实推理能力。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型后发现，相比Pass@1，流行算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau是一个更可靠的指标，能够更好地区分真实推理能力和随机猜测，为评估语言模型推理边界提供了更准确的衡量标准。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLMs提供替代方案但直接获取数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLMs获取文本回复，通过嵌入相似度将这些回复映射到参考陈述的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类测试-重测信度的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，还能提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，提升了LLM应用的泛化能力，并解决了实际部署中的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的编码代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索来解决AutoML和Kaggle竞赛中的机器学习工程问题，在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在机器学习工程场景中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有MLE方法受限于线性或树状搜索结构，无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自我演进能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）在保持树状探索的同时嵌入图结构，支持动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算内（标准运行时间的一半）实现了最先进的性能，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度表现出色。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识和图搜索结构，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能和效率，证明了该方法在复杂搜索空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CaRT方法，通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLM在信息收集任务中适时终止，提高决策效率和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中战略性地收集信息，但现有模型缺乏知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离方向

Method: CaRT方法使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一个轨迹在适当时候终止，另一个经过最小修改的不应终止轨迹。通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLM在信息收集任务中适时终止，平衡信息获取与决策效率

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究需要广度和深度的思考，涉及导航多样化知识空间和推理复杂多步依赖关系，这对智能体系统提出了重大挑战。

Method: 提出FlowSearch多智能体框架，能够战略性地规划和扩展知识流以实现并行探索和分层任务分解，并根据中间推理结果和洞察实时调整知识流。

Result: 在通用和科学基准测试（GAIA、HLE、GPQA和TRQA）上实现了最先进的性能，展示了其在多学科研究场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowSearch证明了通过动态知识流驱动的研究方法在推进科学发现方面的潜力。

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

Conclusion: 早期经验范式为语言智能体提供了实用的学习途径，能够有效连接模仿学习和完全经验驱动的智能体，展示了通过自身经验学习改进的潜力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: 研究如何在教授大型多模态模型新技能的同时避免遗忘已有能力，解决顺序微调中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时在八个基准测试上监控通用能力，使用输出标记分布变化作为遗忘指标，提出两种调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层同时冻结Down投影层。

Result: 发现遗忘在后续阶段可以部分恢复，提出的两种调优方法在获得强目标性能的同时，能很好地保持基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定层，可以有效平衡新技能学习和已有能力的保持，为解决大型多模态模型的顺序学习问题提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循机器人，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力的发展。作者旨在提供一个更根本的本体论和数学解释。

Method: 作者建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过经验分析和理论证明，展示了隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料的区别。

Result: 研究证明了隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝ^d与符号流和训练语料在基数、拓扑和动力学上的区别，产生了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略π_self(A)。提出了双层次发射机制emission(a)=(g(a),ε(a))，其中ε(a)携带认知内容。

Conclusion: 作者得出结论，imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。这为构建真正具有自我意识和元认知能力的AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.
