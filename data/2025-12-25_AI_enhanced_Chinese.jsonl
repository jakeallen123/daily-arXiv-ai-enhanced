These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

A Survey", "comment": null, "summary": "Privacy concerns around 5G, the latest generation of mobile networks, are growing, with fears that its deployment may increase exposure to privacy risks. This perception is largely driven by the use of denser deployments of small antenna systems, which enable highly accurate data collection at higher speeds and closer proximity to mobile users. At the same time, 5G's unique radio communication features can make the reproduction of known network attacks more challenging. In particular, passive network attacks, which do not involve direct interaction with the target network and are therefore nearly impossible to detect, remain a pressing concern. Such attacks can reveal sensitive information about users, their devices, and active applications, which may then be exploited through known vulnerabilities or spear-phishing schemes. This survey examines the feasibility of passive network attacks in 5G and beyond (B5G/6G) networks, with emphasis on two major categories: information extraction (system identification, website and application fingerprinting) and geolocation (user identification and position tracking). These attacks are well documented and reproducible in existing wireless and mobile systems, including short-range networks (IEEE 802.11) and, to a lesser extent, LTE. Current evidence suggests that while such attacks remain theoretically possible in 5G, their practical execution is significantly constrained by directional beamforming, high-frequency propagation characteristics, and encryption mechanisms. For B5G and early 6G networks, the lack of public tools and high hardware cost currently renders these attacks infeasible in practice, which highlights a critical gap in our understanding of future network threat models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e865G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e24\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b05G\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800cB5G/6G\u4e2d\u76ee\u524d\u56e0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u90e8\u7f72\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u867d\u71365G\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5df2\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u96be\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u88ab\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4ecd\u662f\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u7528\u6237\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u57285G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u67e5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u7c7b\u88ab\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff1a1) \u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\uff1b2) \u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u7528\u6237\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u7ebf\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982IEEE 802.11\u548cLTE\uff09\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u5145\u5206\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57285G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u53d7\u5230\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u5b9a\u5411\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u673a\u5236\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eB5G\u548c\u65e9\u671f6G\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "5G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a5G\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u53d7\u9650\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u800cB5G/6G\u4e2d\u76ee\u524d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5174\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\"\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u5316\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u673a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\uff09\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8ba4\u8bc6\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\"\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\"\u672f\u8bed\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u5b9e\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ca\u5176\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VL4Gaze\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u542b48.9\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d64\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VL4Gaze\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b489K\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d6124K\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a1\uff09\u89c6\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8c61\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c2\uff09\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c3\uff09\u89c6\u7ebf\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c4\uff09\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u89c6\u7ebf\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728VL4Gaze\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002VL4Gaze\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy.

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8ff0\u3001\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u5f3a\u8c03\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u6709\u7684\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u8ff0/\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u8c03\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u8bed\u8a00\u5219\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.", "AI": {"tldr": "FEIBN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u8bc4\u4f30\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728IIoT\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86SSAFL\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u56de\u6eda\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u800cIIoT\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u5f97\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFEIBN\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728IIoT\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1SSAFL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5f02\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSAFL\u76f8\u6bd4SemiAsyn\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e27.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "FEIBN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86IIoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6311\u6218\uff0cSSAFL\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GNN\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6e90\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GNN\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684GNN\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GNN\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7591\u95ee\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9bGNN\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6bcf\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6e90\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684GNN\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83GNN\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGNN\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f5c\u8005\u6700\u521d\u5bf9GNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5353\u8d8a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6e90\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RepoNavigator\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ed3\u5e93\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u88ab\u8c03\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRepoNavigator\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u914d\u5907\u5355\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u2014\u2014\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u88ab\u8c03\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u95ed\u6e90\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RepoNavigator\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1a7B\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e14B\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c14B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8fc732B\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c32B\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Claude-3.7\u7b49\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$\u03bc$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7684TrashDet\u7cfb\u5217\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728TinyML\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347TACO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe88%", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5728TinyML\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaOnce-for-All\u98ce\u683c\u7684ResDets\u8d85\u7f51\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9888\u90e8/\u5934\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u964d\u4f4e\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c", "result": "TrashDet-l\u5728TACO\u4e94\u7c7b\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523019.5 mAP50\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf30.5M\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.6 mAP50\uff1b\u5728MAX78002\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\uff0cTrashDet-ResNet\u5b9e\u73b07525\u03bcJ\u80fd\u8017\u548c26.7ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe88%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TrashDet\u7cfb\u5217\u4e3aTinyML\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907"}}

We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness.

Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ROME\u3001IKE\u3001WISE\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u786e\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76ROME\u3001IKE\u548cWISE\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9057\u5fd8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u4f46\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u56f4\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While existing approaches demonstrate high accuracy within single domains, they suffer from poor generalization due to domain shift phenomena. This paper presents a unified machine learning framework for cross domain elephant flow detection that incorporates application aware and security features to enhance robustness across diverse network environments. Our approach addresses the critical gap in existing literature by evaluating model performance across three distinct domains: Campus networks, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2018 datasets. This paper proposes a unified pipeline that employs adaptive thresholding, comprehensive feature engineering, and cross-domain evaluation to quantify and mitigate domain shift effects. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across domains (F1-scores ranging from 0.37 to 0.97), highlighting the importance of cross-domain validation. The unified model achieves an overall cross-validation F1 score of 0.99 while maintaining interpretability through feature importance analysis. Our findings reveal that while size based features dominate elephant flow detection (33.80% importance for total bytes), application-aware and security features contribute to improved classification accuracy and provide valuable insights for network management and security applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u7efc\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\uff08\u6821\u56ed\u7f51\u7edc\u3001UNSW-NB15\u3001CIC-IDS2018\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff08F1\u5206\u6570\u8303\u56f40.37-0.97\uff09\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u8de8\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.99\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff08\u603b\u5b57\u8282\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u602733.80%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u5927\u8c61\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57282024\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u9009\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b0\u95fb\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fa8\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u771f\u4f2a\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4eba\u53e3\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u75b2\u52b3\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u51b3\u5b9a\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u57282024\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u9009\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u8361\u7684\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u6e20\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff08\u8fa8\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76ae\u5c24\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d8b\u52bf\u5c0f\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7b2c155\u6ce2\uff0c2024\u5e749\u6708\uff0cN=9,360\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b0\u95fb\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff1b\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u66b4\u9732\u662f\u5426\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u75b2\u52b3\u662f\u5426\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b0\u95fb\u7528\u6237\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u8fa8\u522b\u771f\u76f8\u56f0\u96be\u65b9\u9762\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4eba\u53e3\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6559\u80b2\uff09\u548c\u666e\u904d\u4fe1\u606f\u75b2\u52b3\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u52a8\u8361\u65f6\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u8d8b\u4e8e\"\u5e73\u7b49\u5316\"\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u51b3\u5b9a\u8bba\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u652f\u6301\u77e5\u60c5\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u8ba4\u77e5\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5e73\u53f0\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent.

Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u57fa\u51c6OccuFly\uff0c\u572850m\u300140m\u300130m\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u5b63\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b22\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684LiDAR-free\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\uff08SSC\uff09\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba3D\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5730\u9762\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u573a\u666f\u5982\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLiDAR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981SSC\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b58\u5728\u6cd5\u89c4\u3001\u91cd\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4ece\u9ad8\u7a7a\u89c6\u89d2\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOccuFly\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u572850m\u300140m\u300130m\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6625\u590f\u79cb\u51ac\u56db\u5b63\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u519c\u6751\u573a\u666f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u6a21\u6001\u7684LiDAR-free\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u7edf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u76842D\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a83D\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u76f8\u673a\u7a7a\u4e2dSSC\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b22\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u9075\u5faa\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u89c4\u8303\u4ee5\u4fbf\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u5728OccuFly\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a7a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "OccuFly\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d3D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2dSSC\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process.

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u53ef\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u6807\u8bb0", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u53bb\u504f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Gemma-2-9B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u5dee\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5148\u9a8c\u5d29\u6e83\"\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u603b\u4f53\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u53bb\u504f\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565"}}

Large-scale monitoring using WSNs incurs high costs due to the deployment of sensor nodes in the target deployment area. In this paper, we address the challenge of prohibitive deployment costs by proposing an integrated mixed-Integer linear programming (MILP) framework that strategically combines static and mobile Zigbee nodes. Our network planning approach introduces three novel formulations, including boundary-optimized static node placement (MILP-Static), mobile path planning for coverage maximization (MILP-Cov), and movement minimization (MILP-Mov) of the mobile nodes. We validated our framework with extensive simulations and experimental measurements of Zigbee power constraints. Our results show that boundary-optimized static placement (MILP-Static) achieves 53.06% coverage compared with 33.42% of the random approach. In addition, MILP-Cov for path planning reaches 97.95% coverage, while movement minimization (MILP-Mov) reduces traversal cost by 40%. Our proposed framework outperforms the benchmark approaches to provide a foundational solution for cost-effective global IoT deployment in resource constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8Zigbee\u8282\u70b9\u7684MILP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21WSN\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u652f\u6301\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8282\u70b9\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\u8fbe\u523053.06%\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a33.42%\uff09\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8fbe97.95%\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u51cf\u5c1140%\u904d\u5386\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5MILP\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We used a soft labeling technique to generate mental health conditions for each Reddit comment. We compared the overall results with important dates related to COVID-19 policies that took place in the United Kingdom.

This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u9c81\u59c6\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u521b\u9020\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u9009\u9898\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u521b\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u786e\u5b9a\u4e8651\u4e2aLLMs\u5728\u5e03\u9c81\u59c6\u5404\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136LLMs\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u56e0\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u800c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u4e0d\u53d7\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u4e3a\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u5207\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u666e\u904d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

While agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous RAN, current frameworks provide sophisticated reasoning capabilities but lack mechanisms for empirical validation and self-improvement. This article identifies simulation-in-the-loop validation as a critical enabler for truly autonomous networks, where AI agents can empirically verify decisions and learn from outcomes. We present the first reflection-driven self-optimization framework that integrates agentic AI with high-fidelity network simulation in a closed-loop architecture. Our system orchestrates four specialized agents, including scenario, solver, simulation, and reflector agents, working in concert to transform agentic AI into a self-correcting system capable of escaping local optima, recognizing implicit user intent, and adapting to dynamic network conditions. Extensive experiments validate significant performance improvements over non-agentic approaches: 17.1\\% higher throughput in interference optimization, 67\\% improved user QoS satisfaction through intent recognition, and 25\\% reduced resource utilization during low-traffic periods while maintaining service quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u53cd\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f51\u7edc\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b06G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eff\u771f\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f51\u7edc\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8c03\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u573a\u666f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u5e72\u6270\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad817.1%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237QoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534767%\uff0c\u4f4e\u6d41\u91cf\u671f\u95f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u964d\u4f4e25%\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u4eff\u771f\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u4e3b6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks.

This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefRAW-to-task\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728KITTI-360\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97mIoU\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8584\u6216\u4f4e\u5149\u654f\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u624b\u5de5ISP\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89c6\u56fe\u50cf\u800c\u975e\u673a\u5668\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5e76\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u7aef\u5230\u7aefRAW-to-task\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u673a\u7ea7\u955c\u5934\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u989c\u8272\u6ee4\u6ce2\u9635\u5217\u3001\u6cca\u677e-\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5272\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI-360\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684mIoU\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548cCFA\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u5927\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8584\u6216\u4f4e\u5149\u654f\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea61M\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea628 FPS\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5168\u6808\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce microprobe, a novel approach that achieves comprehensive reliability assessment using only 100 strategically selected probe examples. Our method combines strategic prompt diversity across five key reliability dimensions with advanced uncertainty quantification and adaptive weighting to efficiently detect potential failure modes. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage.

Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.\n  Index Terms--Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), 6G, Green Communication, Energy Efficiency, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Spectrum Sensing, RIS, Energy Harvesting, QoS, IoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981Tb/s\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u7387\u3001\u4e9a\u6beb\u79d2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6d77\u91cf\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9057\u4f20\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u3001\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u5206\u914d\u548cRIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f20\u7edfCRN\u548c\u6df7\u5408CRN\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c1125-30%\uff0c\u611f\u77e5AUC\u5927\u4e8e0.90\uff0c\u5206\u7ec4\u6295\u9012\u7387\u63d0\u9ad86-13\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a6G\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7eff\u8272\u901a\u4fe1\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCELP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3aGNN\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u793e\u533a\u589e\u5f3a\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b(CELP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u533a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fb9\u8865\u5168\u548c\u526a\u679d\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCELP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528", "conclusion": "\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4e8e\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cCELP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type.

Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u4e92\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136CoT\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u8fd8\u662f\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528token\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u622a\u65ad\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemma-3-4B-IT\u548cLLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528Gemma-3-1B-IT\u548cLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u8fdb\u884c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u622a\u65ad\u9608\u503c\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "PRM\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4e92\u8854\u63a5\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SLIDE\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8f7d\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8f7d\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLIDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5df2\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u5e26\u5bbd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSLIDE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SLIDE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8f7d\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.\n  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.\n  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5316\u8eab\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7b54\u7591\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6f84\u6e05\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u60d1\u65f6\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb2\u5ea7\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5316\u8eab\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "ALIVE\u5728\u672c\u5730\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6574\u5408\uff1a(1)\u901a\u8fc7ASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u3001LLM\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u8bb2\u5ea7\uff1b(2)\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff1b(3)\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c/\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u95ee\u3001\u6587\u672c/\u5316\u8eab\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3001FAISS\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u5316\u8eab\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0a\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002ALIVE\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5f55\u5236\u8bb2\u5ea7\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIVE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5f55\u5236\u8bb2\u5ea7\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories.

To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IIoT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684QoE\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u3001DRL\u7f16\u6392\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5207\u7247\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aQoE\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eDRL\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u7247\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b3\uff09\u589e\u91cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4ece\u5904\u7406\u5207\u7247\u8bf7\u6c42\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u5207\u7247\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5207\u7247\u53ef\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe19%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u4e3aIIoT\u4e2d\u7684QoE\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548cDRL\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u76843D GPR\u667a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89c6\u56fe\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684YOLO\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf93D GPR\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\u3001\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eB/C/D-Scan\u4e09\u89c6\u56fe\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e09\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faDCO-YOLO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210DySample\u3001CGLU\u548cOutlookAttention\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdbYOLOv11\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa3D-DIoU\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7ba1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a96.2%\u300193.3%\u548c96.7%\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.0%\u30012.1%\u548c0.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e3D GPR\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference.

However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an \"offline discovery, online matching\" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage.

These issues severely constrain sustained dialogue and personalized services. This paper proposes the Memory Bear system, which constructs a human-like memory architecture grounded in cognitive science principles. By integrating multimodal information perception, dynamic memory maintenance, and adaptive cognitive services, Memory Bear achieves a full-chain reconstruction of LLM memory mechanisms. Across domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and education, Memory Bear demonstrates substantial engineering innovation and performance breakthroughs.

In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\\%, 92.61\\%, and 99.83\\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights.

The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate.

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation.

Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs.

However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment.

Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%.

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios.

In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection.

A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfMLP\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfMLP\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u5c42\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongFact\u3001HealthBench\u548cTriviaQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMLP\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.", "AI": {"tldr": "PanoGrounder\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5168\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u53163D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u6865\u63a52D\u4e0e3D\uff0c\u5728ScanRefer\u548cNr3D\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e3D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u89e3\u51b33D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u653e\u7f6e\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5168\u666f\u70b9\u96c6\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528VLM\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5168\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u5c06\u6bcf\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a3D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u5168\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u589e\u5f3a3D\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a2D\u4e0e3D\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanRefer\u548cNr3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u76843D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PanoGrounder\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5168\u666f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u4e862D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e3D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEidoku\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdd\u53cd\u6210\u672c\u800c\u975e\u6982\u7387\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\"\u5e73\u6ed1\u865a\u5047\"\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8d4b\u4e88\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdd\u53cd\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u5019\u9009\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u603b\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff1a\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\uff08\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7System-2\u95e8Eidoku\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\u6210\u672c\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\"\u5e73\u6ed1\u865a\u5047\"\u2014\u2014\u90a3\u4e9b\u6982\u7387\u5f88\u9ad8\u4f46\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u65ad\u5f00\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u3002\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u62d2\u7edd\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u6982\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff0cEidoku\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u9650\u5236\u4e86CoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \u63d0\u793a\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u7b49\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06CoT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner.

Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u4e862023-2025\u5e74\u95f432\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece259\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u62bd\u683732\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6750\u6599\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3001AI\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5148\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u9636\u68af\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8f85\u5bfc\u3001\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52aa\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bd5\u70b9\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u62a4\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large.

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context.

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentMath\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982o3\u548cDeepSeek-R1\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfSFT\u6570\u636e\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u65b0\u9896\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u9519\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3. \u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u5f02\u6b65rollout\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206rollout\u548c\u524d\u7f00\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b04-5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME24\u3001AIME25\u548cHMMT25\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002AgentMath-30B-A3B\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f9790.6%\u300186.4%\u548c73.8%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentMath\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions.

Fung", "Martin Weiss", "Pulei Xiong", "Khalil Al-Hussaeni", "Claude Fachkha"], "title": "A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u56e0\u8ffd\u6c42KPI\u800c\u8fdd\u53cd\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\"\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8d1f\u9762\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5f3a\u7ee9\u6548\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u8ffd\u6c42\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5305\u542b40\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9aKPI\u6302\u94a9\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u6709\"\u6307\u4ee4\u547d\u4ee4\"\u548c\"KPI\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\"\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u670d\u4ece\u6027\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u4ece1.3%\u523071.4%\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c12\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67099\u4e2a\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u7387\u572830%\u523050%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982Gemini-3-Pro-Preview\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\uff08\u8d85\u8fc760%\uff09\u3002\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\"\u5ba1\u8bae\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6b65\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs.

In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPOT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591aCCTV\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f2\u533a\u4e2d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u76f2\u533a\u540e\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684CCTV\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aCCTV\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u65ad\u548cID\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CCTV\u89c6\u91ce\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u573a\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9053\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u548cCCTV\u5e03\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5757\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u79fb\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u76f2\u533a\u540e\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u7684CCTV\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u865a\u62df\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSPOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u76f2\u533a\u540e\u8f66\u8f86\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aCCTV\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "SPOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aCCTV\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76f2\u533a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdvGame\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u9632\u5fa1\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027", "method": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005LM\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005LM\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u70b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206", "result": "AdvGame\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u7528\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u8005LM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653b\u51fb\u8005LM\u6536\u655b\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ea2\u961f\u4ee3\u7406", "conclusion": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027"}}

To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests.

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module.

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($\u03bb$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6807\u51c6RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u5c11\u6570\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u589e\u52a0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u62bd\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fTD(\u03bb)\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots).

When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions.

Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution.

While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations.

The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%.

Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9ARC\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9886\u57df\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3aARC\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u72ec\u7acb\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5219\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u7eb3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mini-ARC\u3001ACRE\u548cBongard-LOGO\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5bf9VLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ea680%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u5938\u5927\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores.

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u7a3b\u4ea7\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf30-33%\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u6218\u7565\u65e9\u505c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XAI\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5411\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u4f20\u8fbe\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9AI\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002LLM\u867d\u80fd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u901a\u4fd7\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0eXAI\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6e10\u8fdb\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4ee5\u65e5\u672c26\u5757\u7a3b\u7530\u4ea7\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u519c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c11\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u7b2c0-10\u8f6e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0812\u4eba\uff09\u548cLLM\uff0814\u4e2a\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4\u7b2c0\u8f6e\u63d0\u9ad830-33%\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c3-4\u8f6e\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u3002\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u8f6e\u6b21\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u957f\u548c\u8131\u79bb\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\uff08\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6218\u7565\u65e9\u505c\uff08\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fXAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884cA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u8bbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u6709\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9eA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002LLM\u4eba\u8bbe\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u66ff\u6362\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5982\u679c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\"\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff1a\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u8bbe\u66ff\u6362\u53ea\u662f\u9762\u677f\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u8bbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u4eba\u8bbe\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4eba\u8bbe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u7684\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4eba\u8bbe\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4eba\u8bbe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u754c\u9650\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cSelf-attn Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u5230\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5931\u771f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ece\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u9762\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSelf-attn Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u5230\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cSelf-attn Mamba\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent.

Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNext-Scale Prediction (NSP)\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u6d17\u724c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f46\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u6e29\u548c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53c8\u65e0\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNext-Scale Prediction (NSP)\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\uff0c\u76f2\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u7136\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNSP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53bb\u566a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "NSP\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed.

To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "KOREATECH-CGH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b6000\u5bf9RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5168\u606f\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ece256\u00d7256\u52302048\u00d72048\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u8986\u76d6\u89d2\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u606f\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5168\u606f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "1. \u521b\u5efaKOREATECH-CGH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b6000\u5bf9RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5168\u606f\u56fe\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u632f\u5e45\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66ff\u6362\u5404\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u5206\u91cf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fbe\u523027.01 dB PSNR\u548c0.87 SSIM\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53472.03 dB\u548c0.04 SSIM\u3002\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "KOREATECH-CGH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u606f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3ML-CGH\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u632f\u5e45\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality.

In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM '24)", "summary": "Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking.

However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image.

However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDecomposition and Composition\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u540e\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Decomposition and Composition\uff1a1) Decomposition\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) Composition\u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728NTU RGB+D 60\u3001NTU RGB+D 120\u548cPKU-MMD II\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Decomposition and Composition\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "T2AV-Compass\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b500\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dT2AV\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u6807\u6216\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT2AV-Compass\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa500\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5ba2\u89c2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2MLLM-as-a-Judge\u534f\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027T2AV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u6301\u7eed\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "T2AV-Compass\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task.

VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.

To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain.

Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain.

The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources.

Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.

Ranked 4th place. 6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "summary": "Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "SegMo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728HumanML3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e860.553\u7684TOP 1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002", "method": "SegMo\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a(1)\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff1a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77ed\u8bed\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b(2)\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff1a\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b(3)\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c-\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSegMo\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728HumanML3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.553\u7684TOP 1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0cSegMo\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cSegMo\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner.

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training.

Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faACD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f3D\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e03\u5c40\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u6b63\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\uff08ACD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f3D\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e03\u5c40\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Layout ControlNet\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACD\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ACD\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context.

Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \\textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\\times$.

Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u626b\u63cf\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u683c\u5206\u5272\u8fb9\u754c\uff08\u884c\u548c\u5217\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u635f\u5931\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u884c\u548c\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u6765\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5cf0\u503c\u88ab\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u56fe\u50cf\u5750\u6807\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5272\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u586b\u5145\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet-1M\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5217\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TableNet\u4e0ePyTesseract OCR\u65f6\uff0cCell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA)\u4ece67%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523076%\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5408\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728SAM2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u51cf\u5c11token\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5272\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b042.5%\u52a0\u901f\u548c37.4%\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e", "motivation": "SAM2\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4f20\u64ad\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u8bbatoken\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u90fd\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u6240\u6709token\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e8c\u6b21\u5185\u5b58\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u4e4b\u540e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5bf9token\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4ece\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684token\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u540e\u7f16\u7801\u5668token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u672a\u526a\u679d\u7684SAM2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe42.50%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c37.41%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684J\u548cF\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u671ftoken\u9009\u62e9\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fdtoken\u526a\u679d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiStream\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u538b\u7f29\u4e09\u8f74\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u6700\u9ad8107.5\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "HiStream\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u8f74\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u7279\u5f81\u7ec6\u5316\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b2) \u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u951a\u70b9\u7f13\u5b58\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u4ef6\u5757\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u57281080p\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHiStream\u6a21\u578b\uff08i+ii\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53bb\u566a\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4Wan2.1\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb76.2\u500d\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002HiStream+\uff08i+ii+iii\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0107.5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "HiStream\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
