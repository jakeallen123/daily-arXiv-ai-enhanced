### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM框架利用变形艺术创建视角依赖的对抗样本，在无需模型访问的黑盒设置下攻击自动驾驶视觉系统，同时通过V2X通信触发网络级干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CAV系统依赖视觉DNN和V2X通信，但仍易受物理对抗攻击。现有攻击方法存在局限性，需要一种无需模型访问且能同时影响感知和通信层的攻击框架。

Method: 利用变形艺术原理创建几何扭曲的对抗样本，这些扭曲对人类自然但对目标检测器具有误导性。在CARLA模拟器中评估，使用SUMO-OMNeT++进行网络级影响分析。

Result: 在最佳条件下攻击成功率超过90%，恶劣环境下保持60-80%效果；攻击在6-10米内激活；V2X虚假信息传播使信息峰值年龄增加68-89%。

Conclusion: PHANTOM暴露了CAV生态系统在感知和通信层的严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御机制来应对此类视角依赖的对抗攻击。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型从运动模糊图像中恢复视频序列，揭示拍摄时刻及前后时间的复杂场景动态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊图像虽然降低了视觉质量，但编码了曝光期间场景和相机运动的信息。现有方法依赖手工先验或特定网络架构，难以恢复复杂场景动态，且无法推断拍摄前后的事件

Method: 利用在互联网规模数据集上预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张运动模糊图像中恢复视频序列，揭示拍摄时刻及前后时间的场景动态

Result: 方法优于现有技术，能泛化到具有挑战性的真实世界图像，支持恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D场景结构等下游任务

Conclusion: 通过重新利用预训练视频扩散模型，能够从单张运动模糊图像中恢复复杂场景动态，并推断拍摄前后的事件，为运动模糊图像分析提供了新思路

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦系统经常无法准确捕捉目标主体，用户希望在拍摄后调整对焦，但现有方法效果有限

Method: 使用视频扩散模型从单张模糊图像生成感知准确的对焦堆栈视频序列，并发布了大规模真实世界智能手机对焦堆栈数据集

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了几何模型拟合中的评分函数问题，分析了MAGSAC++方法，发现其推导存在问题且性能并不优于简单方法，提出了统一的评分框架和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RANSAC中几何模型拟合的评分函数问题，特别是分析当前最先进的MAGSAC++方法，发现其推导存在问题且实际性能并不优于简单方法，需要建立更严谨的理论框架。

Method: 1. 扩展几何误差到球形噪声模型；2. 提出包含均匀分布异常值的混合模型，建立阈值参数化的统一框架；3. 分析MAGSAC++的推导问题；4. 提出基于大验证集或小随机验证集的评分函数评估方法。

Result: 1. 发现MAGSAC++的推导不符合合理原则，其评分函数在数值上等价于简单的Gaussian-uniform似然；2. 所有评分函数（包括学习的内点分布）性能相同；3. MAGSAC++并不优于简单方法，对阈值超参数的选择同样敏感。

Conclusion: 论文全面重新审视了当前最先进的几何模型评分方法，为未来改进方法或应用于其他鲁棒拟合问题提供了重要参考，指出需要更严谨的理论基础。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ提出了一种用于3D全景占据预测的新框架，通过混合视图变换分支结合3D高斯和边缘先验，提升了几何一致性和边界感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持精确几何结构和捕捉3D实例空间范围方面存在困难，这影响了全景分离的鲁棒性。需要增强几何一致性和边界感知能力。

Method: 采用混合视图变换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示和离散深度仓公式，生成几何一致性更好的BEV特征。同时从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助信息学习边缘线索。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，HyGE-Occ超越了现有工作，展现出优越的3D几何推理能力。

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过结合高斯深度表示和边缘先验，有效提升了3D全景占据预测的几何一致性和边界感知，实现了更好的场景理解。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Widget2Code任务，针对紧凑、无上下文的小部件UI生成代码，建立首个图像基准和端到端系统WidgetFactory，显著提升视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，而小部件（widgets）作为紧凑、无上下文的微界面，具有密集布局和图标化特点，且缺乏公开标记数据，需要专门研究。

Method: 1) 建立首个图像基准和细粒度评估指标；2) 提出联合感知理解和结构化代码生成的基线方法：遵循设计原则组装原子组件，包含图标检索和可视化模块；3) 开发端到端系统WidgetFactory，包含框架无关的WidgetDSL和编译器，支持多种前端实现，通过自适应渲染满足紧凑性约束。

Result: 基准测试显示通用MLLM优于专用UI2Code方法但仍不可靠；提出的方法显著提升视觉保真度，建立了Widget2Code研究的强基线。

Conclusion: Widget2Code填补了小部件UI代码生成的研究空白，提出的基准、方法和WidgetFactory系统为未来研究提供了统一基础设施，解决了小部件特有的紧凑性和视觉一致性挑战。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign是一个深度学习框架，通过统一的体积和表面表示联合配准3D脑MRI图像，在球形坐标空间中实现皮层和皮层下区域的一致对齐，显著提高了配准精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将脑MRI的体积配准和表面配准分开处理，导致不一致性，限制了后续分析。需要一种能够同时对齐皮层和皮层下区域的统一方法。

Method: 提出NeurAlign深度学习框架，使用中间球形坐标空间连接解剖表面拓扑和体积解剖结构，将球形配准集成到学习中，确保体积和表面域之间的几何一致性。

Result: 在领域内和领域外数据集上，NeurAlign始终优于经典和基于机器学习的配准方法，将Dice分数提高了多达7个点，同时保持规则的变形场。推理速度比标准方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: NeurAlign凭借其卓越的准确性、快速推理和易用性，为联合皮层和皮层下配准设定了新标准，仅需MRI扫描即可使用。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2是一个面向车辆感知的预训练大模型，通过引入车辆对称性、轮廓和语义三种结构化先验知识来指导掩码令牌重建，显著提升了车辆感知的表征学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预训练阶段缺乏对车辆相关知识的有效学习，导致车辆感知表征建模能力不足。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够学习通用车辆感知表征的预训练模型。

Method: 提出VehicleMAE-V2模型，设计了三个模块：对称性引导掩码模块（SMM）利用车辆对称约束选择高质量掩码图像块；轮廓引导表征模块（CRM）通过最小化轮廓特征与重建特征的概率分布差异来保持整体车辆结构信息；语义引导表征模块（SRM）通过对比学习和跨模态蒸馏对齐图像-文本特征。构建了包含400万车辆图像和12,693文本描述的大规模数据集Autobot4M用于预训练。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的广泛实验证明了VehicleMAE-V2的优越性能，表明该方法能够有效学习通用化的车辆感知表征。

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2通过整合车辆的结构化先验知识来指导掩码令牌重建过程，显著增强了模型学习车辆感知通用表征的能力，为车辆中心感知任务提供了有效的预训练解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 展现出块循环深度结构，仅需少量不同块即可循环实现原始L个块的计算，支持通过动力学系统分析研究ViT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Vision Transformers成为标准视觉骨干网络，需要从机制上解释其计算现象学。尽管架构暗示了动力学结构，但缺乏将Transformer深度解释为特征化流的框架。

Method: 提出块循环假设(BRH)，认为训练好的ViT具有块循环深度结构。通过层间表示相似性矩阵分析，训练块循环代理模型(Raptor)，并进行动力学可解释性分析。

Result: 在小型实验中，随机深度和训练促进循环结构。Raptor模型仅用2个块即可恢复DINOv2 ImageNet-1k线性探测96%的准确率。动力学分析发现：类依赖角度盆地收敛、token特定动态、后期低秩更新等模式。

Conclusion: ViT深度中出现了紧凑的循环程序，指向低复杂度的规范解决方案，使这些模型能够通过原理性动力学系统分析进行研究。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360：一种用于360°全景图多条件引导对象编辑的新框架，通过粗到细的自主数据生成和两阶段数据精炼策略，在视觉质量和语义准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑方法扩展到360°全景图时面临挑战，在等距柱状投影和透视视图中经常产生不合理的编辑结果，需要专门针对全景图编辑的解决方案。

Method: 提出SE360框架，包含：1）无需人工干预的粗到细自主数据生成流水线，利用视觉语言模型和自适应投影调整进行层次分析；2）经济高效的两阶段数据精炼策略提升数据真实感；3）基于Transformer的扩散模型训练，支持文本、掩码或参考图像引导的灵活对象编辑。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉质量和语义准确性上优于现有方法，能够生成语义上有意义且几何一致的全景图编辑结果。

Conclusion: SE360成功解决了360°全景图对象编辑的挑战，通过创新的数据生成和精炼策略，实现了高质量、多条件引导的全景图编辑，为全景图编辑领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS是一个计算框架，通过整合30个拓扑和空间特征来量化组织微结构，并将组织空间组织与临床结果关联起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够有效测量组织微环境和宏观环境中空间相互作用及其与临床参数关联的工具，限制了病理全切片图像分析的临床相关性。

Method: 1) 构建特征空间：在传统指标基础上增加30个来自地理信息系统点模式分析的拓扑和空间特征；2) 关联研究引擎：采用类似PheWAS的大规模单变量回归方法，并进行统计校正。

Result: 在KPMP项目的385张PAS染色全切片图像上应用，分析了102个特征（72个传统对象级特征+30个空间特征），代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: HistoWAS框架能够有效连接组织空间组织与临床结果，为组织特征分析和生物标志物发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

*Le Feng,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSD-MIL提出窗口尺度衰减注意力机制，通过聚类采样降低计算成本，逐步衰减窗口尺度来捕捉多尺度局部实例关系，在计算病理学中实现SOTA性能并减少62%内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法主要关注特征提取器和聚合策略，忽略了WSI中实例间的复杂语义关系。基于Transformer的方法虽然试图建模实例依赖，但二次计算复杂度限制了其可扩展性，且固定尺度注意力机制难以精确捕捉不同尺度肿瘤区域的局部相关性，未考虑补丁相关性的距离衰减效应。

Method: 提出WSD-MIL框架：1) 窗口尺度衰减注意力模块，采用聚类采样策略降低计算成本，逐步衰减注意力窗口尺度以捕捉不同尺度的局部实例关系；2) 基于挤压-激励的区域门模块，动态调整窗口权重以增强全局信息建模。

Result: 在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时减少了62%的计算内存消耗。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL通过窗口尺度衰减注意力机制有效解决了现有Transformer-based MIL方法在计算效率和多尺度建模方面的局限性，为计算病理学中的WSI分析提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

TL;DR: DDTM提出了一种双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散分支细化局部语义，Transformer分支保持全局上下文一致性，解决跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖映射面临严重的分辨率不匹配问题，现有弱监督方法难以将细粒度空间结构与粗标签对齐，导致噪声监督和映射精度下降。

Method: 提出DDTM双分支框架：1）扩散分支在粗监督下逐步细化细尺度局部语义；2）Transformer分支强制大空间范围内的长距离上下文一致性；3）伪标签置信度评估模块缓解跨分辨率不一致性带来的噪声。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay基准测试中达到66.52% mIoU，显著优于现有弱监督方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化和全局上下文推理，有效解决了跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题，显著提升了弱监督学习的效果。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: 提出MIVA模块化图像转视频适配器，通过轻量子网络捕捉单一运动模式，仅需约10个样本即可训练，实现精确运动控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像动画生成方面仍有限制：视频信号高维度导致训练数据稀缺，模型倾向于记忆而非遵循提示；难以泛化到训练集中未见过的新运动模式；使用有限数据微调学习新运动模式的研究不足

Method: 提出模块化图像转视频适配器(MIVA)，轻量子网络可附加到预训练扩散模型上，每个MIVA设计用于捕捉单一运动模式，可通过并行化扩展；仅需约10个样本即可在消费级GPU上高效训练；推理时用户可选择单个或多个MIVA指定运动，无需提示工程

Conclusion: MIVA解决了扩散模型在图像动画生成中的关键限制，通过模块化设计实现了高效训练和精确运动控制，为有限数据下的运动模式学习提供了有效方案

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

TL;DR: LaSeRS数据集和SegEarth-R2模型解决遥感图像中复杂语言引导分割的挑战，包括层次粒度、多目标、推理需求和语言变异性，超越现有简单命令的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型只能处理简单的单目标命令，但在复杂的对地观测场景中（如多粒度分割、多目标指令、隐含意图理解）表现不佳，这限制了在灾害响应、环境监测等关键应用中的实际效用。

Method: 提出LaSeRS大规模数据集，涵盖语言引导分割的四个关键维度：层次粒度、目标多重性、推理需求和语言变异性；同时提出SegEarth-R2 MLLM架构，采用空间注意力监督机制处理小目标定位，以及灵活高效的分割查询机制处理单目标和多目标场景。

Conclusion: LaSeRS数据集和SegEarth-R2模型填补了现有数据集过于简化的关键空白，为复杂对地观测推理提供了全面的训练和评估基准，推动了遥感图像中语言引导分割的实际应用。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了单视角（驾驶员）与双视角（驾驶员+道路）在分心驾驶检测中的效果，发现双视角输入在某些架构中能提升性能（SlowOnly提升9.8%），但在某些架构中反而降低性能（SlowFast下降7.2%），表明简单增加视觉上下文不足够，需要专门的多视角融合设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型主要依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了影响驾驶行为的关键环境上下文。本研究旨在探究结合道路视角是否能提高自然驾驶条件下的分心检测准确性。

Method: 使用真实世界驾驶中的同步双摄像头记录，对三种时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）进行基准测试。每种模型在两种输入配置下评估：仅驾驶员视角和堆叠双视角。

Result: 结果显示，上下文输入在某些模型中能改善检测，但性能提升强烈依赖于底层架构。单路径SlowOnly模型在双视角输入下实现了9.8%的改进，而双路径SlowFast模型由于表征冲突导致准确性下降7.2%。

Conclusion: 简单地增加视觉上下文不足够，可能导致干扰，除非架构专门设计用于支持多视角集成。本研究首次系统比较了使用自然驾驶数据的单视角和双视角分心检测模型，强调了融合感知设计对未来多模态驾驶员监控系统的重要性。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN提出了一种多激活平面交互图神经网络，通过从语义解缠的特征子空间学习多面图配置文件，解决了传统单图方法在建模患者特异性病理关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络在医疗诊断中主要依赖从非区分性特征构建的单一静态图，这限制了建模患者特异性病理关系的能力。需要一种能够动态构建多面图配置文件的方法来更好地捕捉复杂的医学关系。

Method: MAPI-GNN首先通过多维鉴别器发现潜在的图感知模式，这些模式指导动态构建激活图堆栈，然后通过关系融合引擎聚合和上下文化这个多面配置文件，实现稳健的诊断。

Result: 在两个包含超过1300个患者样本的多样化任务上的广泛实验表明，MAPI-GNN显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN通过重构单图范式，学习多面图配置文件，能够更好地建模患者特异性病理关系，在多模态医疗诊断中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: H2em：一种用于组合零样本学习的分层双曲嵌入框架，通过双曲几何建模语义层次结构，在封闭和开放世界场景中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZSL方法在欧几里得空间中建模层次结构，但无法扩展到现实世界所需的大规模分类体系，因为欧氏空间的体积多项式增长无法匹配层次结构的指数增长，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出H2em框架：1) 利用双曲几何嵌入树状结构；2) 设计双重层次蕴含损失，使用双曲蕴含锥强制执行预定义层次；3) 设计判别对齐损失，通过硬负样本挖掘在语义相似组合间建立大地距离；4) 设计双曲跨模态注意力实现实例感知的跨模态融合。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛消融实验表明，H2em在封闭世界和开放世界场景中都建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为建模CZSL中的层次结构提供了自然空间，H2em通过精心设计的损失函数和注意力机制有效解决了层次崩溃和细粒度判别问题，显著提升了组合零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin：一个两阶段框架，通过结合视觉特征、拼音表示和大语言模型来提升中文唇语识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文唇语识别面临独特挑战：视觉音素高度模糊，同音字普遍存在。现有方法主要针对英语设计，需要专门的中文解决方案来解决这些歧义问题。

Method: 1. 两阶段框架：共享视频编码器 + 双解码器（同时预测汉字序列和标准拼音）
2. 多任务学习：联合学习字符和语音输出，增强视觉语义表示
3. 推理时：文本解码器生成多个候选转录，将拼音输出与候选汉字序列拼接作为提示，输入大语言模型解决歧义

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过协同利用视觉特征、语音上下文和语言知识，显著改进了中文唇语识别性能，为处理中文特有的语言挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇部同步系统通常需要复杂的掩码处理或使用GANs/扩散模型，导致计算成本高、推理速度慢。需要一种既能保持高质量视觉效果，又能实现实时性能的简化方案。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段是紧凑的一步潜在空间编辑器，使用参考身份、掩码目标帧和低维唇部姿态向量重建图像，仅用重建损失训练；通过自监督生成嘴部变体作为伪真值进行微调，实现无掩码推理。第二阶段是基于流匹配目标的音频到姿态变换器，从语音预测唇部姿态向量。

Conclusion: FlashLips通过解耦唇部控制与渲染，实现了高质量实时唇部同步，无需复杂掩码处理或GANs/扩散模型，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态管道通过整合外部知识有效增强了图像描述的上下文丰富性，为需要更深入视觉-文本理解的实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了激活函数和优化器组合对深度学习人体活动识别系统性能的影响，发现ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop在医疗相关活动识别中表现最佳，准确率可达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体活动识别在医疗保健等领域至关重要，但现有研究多关注架构设计，而激活函数和优化器组合对性能的影响尚未充分分析，特别是在实际应用场景中。

Method: 研究评估了三种激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）与四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad）的组合，使用两种循环神经网络架构（BiLSTM和ConvLSTM），在HMDB51和UCF101数据集的六个医疗相关活动类别上进行实验。

Result: ConvLSTM在所有组合中表现最佳，特别是与Adam或RMSprop结合时准确率高达99%。BiLSTM在UCF101上表现尚可（约98%），但在HMDB51上性能显著下降至约60%，表明其跨数据集鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: 激活函数和优化器的选择对HAR系统性能有显著影响，ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop是最佳配置，为医疗保健等实际应用中的快速精确活动检测提供了优化指导。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成高质量LiDAR点云时难以同时实现多样化的可控性，主要因为复杂点云分布与简单控制信号之间的不平衡问题

Method: 将文本、图像和点云统一表示为3D布局，转换为语义和深度控制信号，使用基于rangemap的ControlNet引导LiDAR点云生成

Result: 实现了像素级对齐的可控LiDAR点云生成，支持从任意文本描述、图像和草图创建自动驾驶环境

Conclusion: LiDARDraft通过3D布局桥接多种控制信号与LiDAR点云，实现了高质量且可控的点云生成，支持"从零开始模拟"自动驾驶环境

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Motivation: 现有确定性网络渲染速度快但会模糊未观测区域，而随机扩散方法能生成合理内容但计算成本高。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 使用双向Transformer编码多视图图像token和Plucker射线嵌入，生成共享潜在表示。然后使用两个轻量级头：前馈回归头处理几何约束良好的区域，掩码自回归扩散头补全遮挡或未观测区域。端到端训练，结合光度损失和扩散损失。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功统一了确定性和随机方法的优势，实现了高质量且高效的新颖视角合成，无需手工3D归纳偏置，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Motivation: 现有文档图像检索方法主要基于图像查询，只能检索粗粒度语义类别（如报纸、收据），无法处理现实场景中常见的细粒度语义文本查询。

Method: 1) 构建NL-DIR基准数据集：41K真实文档图像，每张图像配5个通过大语言模型生成并人工验证的高质量细粒度语义查询；2) 评估现有主流对比视觉语言模型和OCR-free视觉文档理解模型；3) 研究两阶段检索方法以提高性能同时保持时空效率。

Result: 建立了包含41K文档图像和高质量查询的NL-DIR基准测试，对现有模型进行了零样本和微调评估，并提出了改进的两阶段检索方法。

Conclusion: NL-DIR基准测试填补了文档图像检索中细粒度语义查询的空白，为视觉文档理解社区提供了新的研究机会和促进工具。

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础设施检测技术存在局限性：探地雷达难以检测潮湿和浅层缺陷，红外热成像受天气影响且深度有限。单模态方法存在互补约束，需要融合多模态数据来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出多模态注意力网络，包含：1)雷达时间注意力处理时间模式；2)热成像空间注意力处理空间特征；3)跨模态融合通过可学习嵌入发现互补缺陷模式；4)通过蒙特卡洛dropout和学习方差估计进行不确定性量化，分解为认知和偶然不确定性。

Result: 在五个桥梁数据集上，平衡到中度不平衡数据时，该方法在准确率和AUC上显著优于基线方法，优于单模态和基于拼接的融合。跨模态注意力提供关键增益，多头机制改善校准。不确定性量化减少校准误差，支持选择性预测。

Conclusion: 注意力架构在典型场景表现良好，但极端类别不平衡时易出现多数类崩溃。系统保持部署效率，支持实时检测并明确能力和限制，为实际应用提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法存在多源纠缠和视听不对齐问题，导致偏向更大或更响的物体，而忽略较弱、较小或共现的声源。

Method: 提出DDAVS框架：1) 使用可学习查询从音频原型记忆库中提取音频语义并锚定在结构化语义空间，通过对比学习增强区分性和鲁棒性；2) 引入延迟模态交互的双重交叉注意力机制，改善多模态对齐的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DDAVS通过解耦音频语义和延迟双向对齐，有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键挑战，在复杂真实场景下表现出强大的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

TL;DR: HEART-ViT：首个基于Hessian二阶导数的统一动态注意力与token剪枝框架，通过曲率加权敏感度分析，在保持精度的同时大幅降低ViT计算开销，实现边缘设备高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然精度领先，但其二次注意力成本和冗余计算严重阻碍在延迟和资源受限平台上的部署。现有剪枝方法孤立处理token或注意力头，依赖启发式或一阶信号，往往牺牲精度或无法跨输入泛化。

Method: HEART-ViT使用高效的Hessian-vector乘积估计token和注意力头的曲率加权敏感度，在明确损失预算下进行原则性剪枝决策。该框架统一处理token剪枝（主导计算节省）和注意力头剪枝（提供细粒度冗余移除）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，使用ViT-B/16和DeiT-B/16，HEART-ViT实现高达49.4%的FLOPs减少、36%的延迟降低和46%的吞吐量提升，同时微调后保持或超越基线精度（如40% token剪枝时恢复4.7%精度）。在AGX Orin等边缘设备上验证了推理速度和能效的实际提升。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT填补了理论与实践的鸿沟，提供了首个统一、曲率驱动的剪枝框架，既保持精度又实现边缘高效，为Vision Transformers在资源受限平台上的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Motivation: 毫米波雷达作为隐私保护且不受光照影响的传感器，可用于人体姿态估计，但由于镜面反射导致雷达信号稀疏，从雷达信号中提取鲁棒特征极具挑战性。

Method: 提出milliMamba框架：1）采用Cross-View Fusion Mamba编码器高效提取长序列的时空特征（线性复杂度）；2）使用Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention解码器预测多帧关节坐标；3）训练时结合速度损失和关键点损失增强运动平滑性。

Conclusion: milliMamba通过联合建模时空依赖关系，能够利用相邻帧和关节的上下文信息推断因镜面反射而缺失的关节，显著提升了基于雷达的人体姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Motivation: 果園自動化任務面臨環境變異大和遮擋問題，傳統蘋果姿態估計方法依賴關鍵點標註，但蘋果的萼片等關鍵點常被遮擋，導致標註困難且耗時，不同圖像間可能存在衝突或缺失的標註

Method: 提出新流程：1) 使用3D高斯潑濺重建果園場景，2) 簡化標註流程，3) 自動將標註投影到圖像，4) 訓練和評估姿態估計方法。僅需105個手動標註即可獲得28,191個訓練標籤

Result: 使用遮擋≤95%的果實標籤訓練效果最佳，在原始圖像上F1分數0.927，渲染圖像上0.970。訓練集大小調整對模型性能影響小。遮擋越少的果實位置估計越好，但測試方法無法正確學習蘋果方向估計

Conclusion: 提出的3D重建流程能大幅減少蘋果姿態估計的標註工作量，有效處理遮擋問題，但方向估計仍需改進。該方法為果園自動化提供了高效的數據標註解決方案

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Motivation: 传统像素空间压缩方法在低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感和高保真度，因为像素空间失真与人类感知不一致。需要寻找更符合感知的压缩空间。

Method: 1. 在VQ-VAE的生成式潜在空间进行变换编码；2. 引入分类超模块降低超信息比特成本；3. 使用基于码预测的监督增强语义一致性。

Result: 在自然图像上<0.04 bpp，人脸图像上<0.01 bpp仍保持高视觉质量；在CLIC2020测试集上，以45%更少的比特数达到与MS-ILLM相同的FID；支持图像修复和风格迁移等应用。

Conclusion: 生成式潜在空间具有更好的稀疏性、语义丰富性和感知对齐性，是实现高质量低比特率图像压缩的有效途径，并支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: JDPNet：一种联合退化处理网络，通过挖掘和统一耦合退化中的潜在信息，有效处理水下图像的多重非线性耦合退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在多种退化类型，这些退化呈现非线性耦合而非简单叠加，现有方法通常针对特定退化设计分支或模块，忽略了耦合中嵌入的潜在信息，难以从自底向上视角有效处理多重退化的非线性交互。

Method: 提出JDPNet联合退化处理网络，包含联合特征挖掘模块和概率引导分布策略，用于有效挖掘和统一调整耦合退化特征；设计AquaBalanceLoss损失函数平衡颜色、清晰度和对比度，指导网络从多重耦合退化损失中学习。

Result: 在六个公开水下数据集和两个新构建数据集上的实验表明，JDPNet在性能、参数量和计算成本之间取得更好平衡，展现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: JDPNet通过统一框架挖掘耦合退化中的潜在信息，有效解决了水下图像多重非线性耦合退化的处理难题，在性能与效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFusion是一个新颖的多模态3D检测器，将LiDAR数据作为几何信息补充源来增强基于相机的检测，完全消除对3D骨干网络的依赖，提高部署友好性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态3D检测器过度依赖LiDAR传感器，当LiDAR缺失时性能大幅下降，且依赖3D稀疏卷积算子难以在不同硬件平台（如NPU、FPGA）上部署。需要一种更鲁棒、部署友好的多模态检测方法。

Method: LiteFusion重新思考LiDAR在相机-LiDAR融合范式中的角色，将LiDAR点云作为几何信息补充源而非独立模态。在四元数空间中集成LiDAR点到图像特征中，保持正交约束，建模跨模态的领域特定关系，生成紧凑的跨模态嵌入。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiteFusion将基线视觉检测器的mAP提升20.4%，NDS提升19.7%，参数仅增加1.1%。即使没有LiDAR输入，仍能保持良好结果，展现了跨不同融合范式和部署场景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过将LiDAR作为几何信息补充源而非独立模态，实现了部署友好且鲁棒的多模态3D检测，消除了对专用LiDAR编码器和3D骨干网络的依赖，为实际自动驾驶系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicDLP：首个大规模多语言文档布局数据集，涵盖11种印度语言和英语，解决现有数据集在规模、多样性和标注粒度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档布局数据集存在三大问题：1）大规模数据集（如PubLayNet、DocBank）缺乏细粒度区域标签和多语言多样性；2）人工标注数据集（如M6Doc、D4LA）标签丰富但规模太小且多语言覆盖不足；3）印度语言文档虽然脚本多样但在现有数据集中代表性不足，限制了文档理解进展。

Method: 1）创建IndicDLP数据集，涵盖11种代表性印度语言和英语，覆盖12个常见文档领域；2）从DocLayNet和M6Doc中提取UED-mini数据集用于增强预训练；3）在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型，验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明：1）在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型能显著提升性能；2）在IndicDLP上训练的模型能良好泛化到非印度语言布局；3）IndicDLP成为文档数字化的重要资源。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了文档布局分析在规模、多样性和标注粒度上的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解，特别为印度语言文档处理提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

TL;DR: 提出DAMP框架，通过空间-光谱退化度量作为退化提示，实现无需显式退化先验的统一高光谱图像恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一高光谱图像恢复方法依赖难以获取的显式退化先验（如退化标签），而实际场景中退化复杂且混合，需要更灵活的解决方案

Method: 设计空间-光谱退化度量连续量化多维退化作为退化提示；引入空间-光谱自适应模块动态调制特征提取；将SSAM作为专家集成到混合专家架构中，用DP作为门控路由器

Result: 在自然和遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，DAMP实现了最先进的性能，并展现出卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过退化感知度量提示，实现了对多样、混合或未见退化的自适应、高效和鲁棒的恢复，解决了现有方法对显式退化先验的依赖问题

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像语义分割面临类间相似性高、类内差异大的挑战，现有方法难以将抽象且具有强判别性的语义知识有效注入像素级特征学习，导致复杂场景中边界模糊和类别混淆。

Method: 提出BiCoR-Seg框架，包含三个核心组件：1) HBIS模块通过生成类别级热图建立特征图与类别嵌入之间的双向信息流；2) 层次监督策略利用每个HBIS模块生成的可解释热图作为低分辨率分割预测进行监督；3) 跨层类别嵌入Fisher判别损失增强嵌入表示的判别能力。

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg通过双向协同精炼框架有效解决了高分辨率遥感图像语义分割中的挑战，在提升分割精度的同时增强了模型的可解释性，为复杂场景下的遥感图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability. The released code is available at https://github.com/ShiJinghao566/BiCoR-Seg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADLE-MM：一种基于有限标注和模型集成初始化的多模态虚假信息检测器，在参数更少的情况下实现竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成和操纵多媒体内容的工具日益普及，现实主义的合成篡改数字媒体已成为广泛威胁，常涉及跨多模态的同时操纵。这些技术被越来越多地用于扭曲重要事件的叙述和在社交媒体上传播虚假信息，促使虚假信息检测器的发展。现有方法通常依赖计算密集型架构或需要大量标注数据。

Method: 提出LADLE-MM：基于有限标注的检测器，采用模型集成初始化的多模态虚假信息检测器。由两个单模态分支和一个多模态分支组成，多模态分支使用从BLIP提取的额外多模态嵌入来增强图像和文本表示，作为固定的参考空间。设计用于在有限标注设置和受限训练资源下运行。

Result: 在DGM4基准测试中，尽管使用的可训练参数比先前最先进模型少60.3%，但在二元和多标签分类任务上均实现竞争性性能，在无基础标注训练时优于现有方法。在VERITE数据集上，优于当前使用更复杂大型视觉语言模型架构的最先进方法，展示了在开放集设置中的有效泛化能力和对单模态偏差的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LADLE-MM展示了在有限标注和计算资源下实现高效多模态虚假信息检测的可行性，通过模型集成初始化和固定多模态参考空间，在参数更少的情况下达到甚至超越更复杂架构的性能，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: D³ETOR是一个两阶段弱监督伪装目标检测框架，通过辩论增强伪标签和频率感知渐进去偏，显著缩小了弱监督与全监督COD之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSCOD方法存在两个主要限制：1）通用分割模型生成的伪标签不可靠，缺乏COD任务特定的语义理解；2）忽视了涂鸦标注的固有偏差，阻碍模型捕捉伪装目标的全局结构。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段采用自适应熵驱动点采样和多智能体辩论机制增强SAM的COD能力；第二阶段设计FADeNet，渐进融合多级频率感知特征，动态重加权监督强度以缓解涂鸦偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著缩小了弱监督与全监督COD之间的差距。

Conclusion: D³ETOR通过联合利用伪标签和涂鸦语义的监督信号，有效解决了WSCOD中的伪标签不可靠和标注偏差问题，为弱监督伪装目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学影像领域应用广泛，但复杂模型（如ResNets、Vision Transformers）的可解释性差。SHAP虽然提供可解释的可视化，但在存在认知和随机不确定性时，其解释可能不稳定不可靠。需要量化这些不确定性来增强医学影像应用中SHAP解释的可信度。

Method: 使用Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论，通过信念图、可信图和融合图方法，结合统计定量分析，量化SHAP解释中的不确定性。在三个具有不同类别分布、图像质量和模态类型的医学影像数据集（病理学、眼科学、放射学）上进行评估。

Result: 框架能够量化SHAP解释中的不确定性，特别是在存在显著认知不确定性的情况下（如不同图像分辨率和模态特异性带来的噪声）。通过三个医学影像数据集的评估，验证了框架在不同条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了医学影像中SHAP解释的不确定性问题，通过量化不确定性增强了模型解释的可信度和可靠性，为医学影像领域的可解释AI提供了更稳健的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频虚拟试衣方法难以捕捉细粒度服装动态、保持视频帧间背景完整性，且因额外交互模块导致计算成本高，现有公开数据集规模和质量有限也限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出关键帧驱动的细节注入策略：1) 指令引导的关键帧采样策略从输入视频筛选信息帧；2) 服装细节增强模块和协作背景优化模块分别从关键帧提取服装动态到服装潜在空间、优化背景潜在空间完整性；3) 将丰富细节与姿态、掩码、噪声潜在空间一起注入标准DiT块。

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，在不显式修改DiT架构的情况下实现了高效、真实的试衣视频合成，同时避免了额外复杂性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Motivation: 现有推理时优化方法依赖隐式、整体的评价或无约束的提示重写，导致行为难以解释、控制或可靠停止。而大语言模型已从基于验证、针对性修正和提前停止的显式结构化思考中受益。

Method: CRAFT将提示分解为依赖结构化的视觉问题，使用视觉语言模型验证生成的图像，通过LLM代理仅在约束失败时应用针对性提示编辑。该过程迭代进行，一旦所有约束满足就使用显式停止标准。

Result: 在多个模型家族和挑战性基准测试中，CRAFT持续提升组合准确性、文本渲染和基于偏好的评估，特别是对轻量级生成器有显著改进。这些改进仅带来可忽略的推理时间开销。

Conclusion: 显式结构化、约束驱动的推理时推理是提高多模态生成模型可靠性的关键要素，允许较小或较便宜的模型接近更昂贵系统的质量。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

TL;DR: 提出DETACH框架，通过分解时空特征解决外中心视频与环境传感器对齐中的局部细节丢失和时空模式误对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可穿戴传感器的自我中心视频对齐方法存在用户不适、隐私问题和可扩展性限制，而外中心视频与环境传感器作为非侵入性替代方案，但全局对齐方法无法捕捉局部细节且容易误对齐相似时间模式但不同语义的动作

Method: 提出DETACH分解时空框架：1) 通过分解特征保留局部细节；2) 通过在线聚类发现传感器-空间特征提供语义基础；3) 两阶段对齐：先通过互监督建立空间对应，再通过空间-时间加权对比损失进行时间对齐，自适应处理不同类型负样本

Conclusion: DETACH框架有效解决了外中心视频与环境传感器对齐中的关键问题，为非侵入式、可扩展的人类动作识别提供了可行方案

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中存在对正常场景的固有偏置，难以有效检测犯罪等异常行为。虽然思维链推理策略在语言任务中表现良好，但其缺乏异常推理偏置，导致模型偏向正常解释。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)多智能体推理框架，在推理过程中引入归纳性犯罪偏置，通过最终的异常聚焦分类层来引导模型关注异常特征。

Result: 在低分辨率视频中异常检测F1分数提升11.8个百分点，在高分辨率视频中异常分类提升3.78个百分点，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CoAT框架通过引入异常偏置推理机制，有效克服了大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中的正常性偏置问题，显著提升了异常检测和分类性能。

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的运动理解方法大多忽略了关节驱动力等物理线索，而这些线索在生物力学中是基础性的。本研究旨在探索物理推断的力信号是否以及何时能增强运动理解能力。

Method: 将力信号整合到现有的运动理解流程中，在8个基准测试上系统评估其对基线模型的影响，涵盖步态识别、动作识别和细粒度视频描述三大任务。

Result: 在所有基准测试中，整合力信号都带来了性能提升：CASIA-B步态识别Rank-1准确率从89.52%提升到90.39%；Gait3D从46.0%提升到47.3%；Penn Action动作识别提升2.00%，其中高用力类别如拳击/拍打提升6.96%；视频描述任务中ROUGE-L从0.310提升到0.339。

Conclusion: 物理推断的力信号能够显著补充视觉和运动学特征，特别是在动态、遮挡或外观变化的条件下，为运动理解提供了有价值的物理线索。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷仍是严重的人道主义威胁，全球有1.1亿枚活跃地雷分布在60个国家，每年造成2.6万人伤亡。研究旨在利用地雷与周围土壤的热对比度，通过无人机系统探测地表地雷，提高检测效果。

Method: 使用自适应RGB和长波红外（LWIR）融合技术，采用YOLO架构（v8、v10、v11）在114张测试图像上进行评估，生成35,640个模型条件评估。同时比较了RF-DETR、Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和RetinaNet等架构，并分析了多时相训练数据集与季节特定方法的差异。

Result: YOLOv11达到最佳性能（86.8% mAP），10-30%热融合在5-10米高度为最优检测参数。RF-DETR精度最高（69.2% mAP），但YOLOv11训练速度快17.7倍。多时相训练数据集比季节特定方法高1.8-9.6%。反坦克地雷检测准确率61.9%，反人员地雷仅19.2%。

Conclusion: 自适应热融合显著提升地表地雷检测性能，YOLOv11在精度和效率间取得最佳平衡。多时相训练增强模型鲁棒性，但反人员地雷检测仍具挑战。未来需研究不同埋藏深度和土壤类型下的热对比度效应。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

TL;DR: SirenPose：一种结合周期性激活网络与关键点几何监督的几何感知损失函数，用于从单目视频中准确、时序一致地重建动态3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在快速运动、多物体交互、遮挡和快速场景变化等挑战性场景中，往往难以保持运动保真度和时空一致性。需要一种能够处理复杂动态并保持物理合理重建的方法。

Method: 1. 结合正弦表示网络的周期性激活特性与基于关键点的几何监督；2. 引入物理启发约束，在空间和时间维度上强制执行一致的关键点预测；3. 利用高频信号建模捕捉细粒度几何细节；4. 扩展UniKPT数据集至60万标注实例；5. 集成图神经网络建模关键点关系和结构相关性。

Result: 在Sintel、Bonn和DAVIS基准测试中一致优于最先进方法。在DAVIS上：FVD降低17.8%，FID降低28.7%，LPIPS提升6.0%（相比MoSCA）。同时改善时序一致性、几何精度、用户评分和运动平滑度。在姿态估计中优于Monst3R，具有更低的绝对轨迹误差以及平移和旋转相对姿态误差。

Conclusion: SirenPose通过几何感知损失函数和物理约束，有效处理快速运动、复杂动态，实现物理合理的3D场景重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

Motivation: 单视角RGB物体姿态估计方法存在深度模糊、遮挡和杂乱等问题，而现有多视角方法要么依赖精确的单视角估计，要么缺乏对未见物体的泛化能力。需要一种能够有效利用多视角信息且具有良好泛化性的方法。

Method: 提出AlignPose方法：1）基于多视角外参标定的RGB图像；2）设计多视角特征度量细化模块，通过优化一致的世界坐标系物体姿态，最小化实时渲染物体特征与观测图像特征在所有视角上的差异；3）无需物体特定训练或对称性标注。

Conclusion: AlignPose通过多视角特征度量优化有效解决了单视角方法的局限性，在保持泛化性的同时显著提升了姿态估计精度，特别适用于工业应用场景。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的图像融合方法通常使用粗粒度文本描述，这限制了细粒度细节的理解和精确的跨模态对齐，需要更精细的文本指导来提升融合质量。

Method: 提出MTIF框架：1）引入多粒度文本描述（细节、结构、语义）；2）分层跨模态调制模块；3）各粒度监督信号促进对齐；4）显著性驱动的数据增强模块。

Result: 在多重曝光和多重焦点图像融合任务上的大量实验表明，MTIF始终优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 多粒度文本描述和分层跨模态调制能有效提升图像融合质量，为文本引导的图像融合提供了新范式。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM是一个文本引导的视觉令牌选择框架，通过跨模态相似度计算和视觉显著性融合，动态减少视觉令牌数量，实现高效压缩而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型处理大量视觉令牌时产生二次注意力成本和冗余，现有令牌减少方法要么忽略文本查询，要么依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，导致语义对齐退化。

Method: 提出文本引导的视觉令牌选择框架，计算投影图像令牌与标准化文本嵌入之间的显式跨模态相似度，通过对数域加权和温度控制锐化融合外在相关性与内在视觉显著性，并采用多样性保留分区保留最小但具代表性的背景令牌。

Result: 在相同令牌预算下，FlashVLM在LLaVA 1.5上压缩77.8%视觉令牌时实现超越无损压缩，甚至略微超过未剪枝基线，在94.4%压缩率下仍保持92.8%准确率，在14个图像和视频基准测试中达到最先进的效率性能权衡。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的视觉令牌选择，在保持强鲁棒性和泛化能力的同时，为主流视觉语言模型提供了卓越的效率性能平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了仿真中模仿学习性能受限的原因，发现专家与学生之间的感知不对称（专家有特权信息而学生只有传感器数据）是主要瓶颈，通过缩小这一差距，提出的TFv6策略在CARLA基准上达到了新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真器能生成无限驾驶数据，但模仿学习策略在仿真中的闭环性能仍然不佳。研究发现专家（有特权信息）与学生（仅传感器观测）之间的不对齐限制了模仿学习效果，专家有更高的可见性（忽略遮挡）和更低的感知不确定性，导致学生难以可靠模仿。

Method: 通过实证研究专家与学生之间的感知不对称问题，提出缩小这一差距的实用干预措施。开发了TransFuser v6（TFv6）学生策略，并在共享的仿真到现实流程中整合了感知监督。

Result: TFv6在CARLA所有主要公开闭环基准上达到新的SOTA：Bench2Drive达到95 DS，Longest6~v2和Town13性能翻倍。在NAVSIM和Waymo视觉端到端驾驶基准上也获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 专家与学生之间的感知不对称是仿真中模仿学习性能受限的关键因素，通过缩小这一差距可以显著提升驾驶性能。提出的方法在多个基准上验证了有效性，为仿真到现实的驾驶策略学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

TL;DR: DiTracker：利用预训练的视频扩散变换器（DiT）进行点跟踪，通过注意力匹配、轻量级微调和成本融合，在挑战性基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ResNet等浅层卷积网络的方法处理帧间独立，缺乏时间一致性，在挑战性条件下匹配成本不可靠。视频DiT在大规模真实视频上预训练，具有时空注意力机制，天生具备点跟踪能力。

Method: DiTracker通过三个关键组件适配视频DiT：1) 查询-键注意力匹配，2) 轻量级LoRA微调，3) 与ResNet骨干网络的成本融合。

Result: 在ITTO基准上达到SOTA性能，在TAP-Vid基准上匹配或超越现有最佳模型，尽管训练批量小8倍。验证了视频DiT特征作为点跟踪的有效高效基础。

Conclusion: 视频扩散变换器的预训练特征为点跟踪提供了强大基础，DiTracker展示了如何有效利用这些特征，在挑战性条件下实现鲁棒跟踪性能。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

*Daewoon Kim,Si Young Yie,Jae Sung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD是一种用于联邦学习的新型优化方法，通过比例编排导数机制提高学习效率和通信成本，解决了FedPIDAvg在数据利用和参与者依赖方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法FedPIDAvg虽然通过PID控制器和泊松分布建模提高了性能，但存在两个主要问题：1) 基于泊松分布排除异常值参与者限制了数据利用；2) PID控制器需要在整个联邦学习过程中保持相同参与者，依赖先前轮次的学习信息。FedPOD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FedPOD采用比例编排导数机制，包含三个关键改进：1) 包含被排除的异常值参与者；2) 消除对先前轮次学习信息的依赖；3) 应用每轮验证损失计算方法。设计灵感来自Kubernetes的最小计算单元POD，支持类似Kubernetes自动扩展的灵活设计。

Result: FedPOD在Dice分数指标上与FedPIDAvg表现相当：WT平均0.78，ET平均0.71，TC平均0.72。平均收敛分数为0.74。同时提高了效率、灵活性和性能指标。

Conclusion: FedPOD通过解决FedPIDAvg的限制，展示了增强联邦学习的潜力，特别是在提高效率、灵活性和性能指标方面。其Kubernetes POD启发的设计支持灵活的扩展架构。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出ORCA框架，通过内部世界模型和OTAR循环使视频化身具备主动智能，实现长期目标导向的自主规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频化身生成方法虽然能保持身份一致性和动作对齐，但缺乏真正的自主性，无法通过自适应环境交互来追求长期目标。需要解决视频化身从被动动画到主动智能行为的转变问题。

Method: 提出ORCA框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 闭环OTAR循环（观察-思考-行动-反思），在生成不确定性下保持鲁棒状态跟踪；2) 分层双系统架构，系统2进行战略推理和状态预测，系统1将抽象计划转换为具体的动作描述。将化身控制建模为POMDP，实现连续信念更新和结果验证。

Result: 实验表明ORCA在任务成功率和行为一致性方面显著优于开环和非反思基线方法，验证了内部世界模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: ORCA框架通过内部世界模型能力使视频化身具备主动智能，实现了从被动动画到主动目标导向行为的转变，为视频化身智能的进一步发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree是一个认知科学启发的层次化框架，将空间能力分为四个级别（感知、心理映射、模拟、智能体能力），并构建了首个能力中心的层次化基准，揭示了MLLMs中空间能力的结构、转移动态和改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学表明空间能力是渐进发展的，但在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中，这种层次结构仍未被充分理解。现有研究大多关注有限的任务集，缺乏对空间能力层次结构的系统性理解。

Method: 1. 提出SpatialTree框架，将空间能力分为四个层次：低级感知（L1）、心理映射（L2）、模拟（L3）、智能体能力（L4）
2. 构建首个能力中心的层次化基准，评估主流MLLMs在27个子能力上的表现
3. 通过有监督微调探索能力转移动态
4. 提出自动思考策略来改进强化学习，抑制不必要的思考过程

Result: 1. 评估结果显示清晰的结构：L1技能基本正交，而高级技能高度相关，表明依赖性增加
2. 发现令人惊讶的转移动态：L1内存在负迁移，但从低级到高级能力存在强跨级转移和协同效应
3. 发现朴素的RL鼓励"思考"不可靠：有助于复杂推理但损害直觉感知
4. 提出的自动思考策略能抑制不必要的思考，使RL在所有级别上持续提升性能

Conclusion: SpatialTree为理解和系统性扩展MLLMs中的空间能力提供了一个概念验证框架，揭示了空间能力的层次结构、转移动态，并提出了有效的改进方法，为未来研究提供了系统化的评估和改进途径。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen提出了一种在语义空间而非VAE潜在空间生成视频的新方法，通过两阶段生成过程（先语义特征规划，后VAE潜在生成）来提升生成质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常在VAE潜在空间学习视频分布，然后通过VAE解码器映射到像素空间。这种方法虽然能生成高质量视频，但收敛速度慢，生成长视频时计算成本高。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段使用扩散模型生成紧凑的语义视频特征，定义视频的全局布局；第二阶段使用另一个扩散模型，以语义特征为条件生成VAE潜在表示，最终产生输出。

Result: 在语义空间生成相比VAE潜在空间收敛更快，计算效率更高，特别适合长视频生成。实验表明SemanticGen能生成高质量视频，优于现有最先进方法和强基线。

Conclusion: 通过先在紧凑的语义空间进行全局规划，再添加高频细节的两阶段方法，SemanticGen有效解决了传统视频生成模型收敛慢、计算成本高的问题，为高质量视频生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的智能体框架，从非结构化电子健康记录中提取结构化肿瘤学数据，在40万份临床笔记上达到平均F1分数0.93，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的非结构化笔记包含丰富的临床信息，但可靠提取结构化肿瘤学数据面临挑战：变异性大、术语专业、格式不一致。手动提取准确但成本高昂不可扩展，现有自动化方法通常只处理狭窄场景，无法充分处理患者级别的信息综合。

Method: 提出智能体框架，将复杂的肿瘤学数据提取分解为模块化、自适应任务。使用大型语言模型作为推理智能体，配备上下文敏感检索和迭代综合能力，从真实世界肿瘤学笔记中全面提取结构化临床变量。

Result: 在包含40万份非结构化临床笔记和扫描PDF报告（涵盖2250名癌症患者）的大规模数据集上评估，平均F1分数达到0.93，103个肿瘤学特定临床变量中有100个超过0.85，关键变量（如生物标志物和药物）超过0.95。集成到数据整理工作流中，直接人工批准率达到0.94，显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于LLM的智能体在结构化肿瘤学数据提取中的全面端到端应用，能够大规模处理真实世界临床数据，为癌症治疗决策和研究提供可靠的数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

TL;DR: LLMs在零样本下对课堂指令分类表现中等，但通过少样本提示可显著提升性能（最佳配置Cohen's Kappa达0.58），不过性能仍受限于可靠性约束且存在召回率与误报率的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育技术中广泛应用，了解其在未经大量定制的情况下对真实教育场景的解读能力至关重要，这有助于设定预期和建立基准。

Method: 比较了6个LLM在课堂转录本中分类教学指令的基线性能，评估了零样本、单样本和少样本三种典型提示方法。

Result: 零样本表现中等，少样本提示显著提升了最先进模型的性能（最佳配置Cohen's Kappa=0.58），但改进不均衡：性能因教学指令类型而异，高召回率常伴随误报率增加。

Conclusion: 基础模型在解读教学话语方面表现出有意义但有限的能力，提示设计有助于展现其潜力，但无法消除根本的可靠性限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于LLM的反事实框架来量化机器学习论文中的修辞风格，发现愿景式修辞能显著预测下游关注度，且2023年后修辞强度急剧上升主要源于LLM写作辅助工具的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI领域对机器学习论文中的"炒作"现象日益关注，但现有方法难以将修辞风格与实质内容分离。由于大胆的语言可能源于强实证结果或仅仅是修辞风格，区分二者具有挑战性。

Method: 提出基于LLM的反事实框架：多个LLM修辞角色从相同实质内容生成反事实写作，LLM裁判通过成对比较进行评估，使用Bradley-Terry模型聚合结果。应用于2017-2025年8,485篇ICLR投稿，生成超过25万篇反事实写作。

Result: 愿景式修辞能显著预测下游关注度（引用和媒体关注），即使控制同行评审评估后依然如此。观察到2023年后修辞强度急剧上升，实证证据表明这主要由LLM写作辅助工具的采用驱动。框架可靠性通过角色选择的鲁棒性和LLM判断与人工标注的高相关性得到验证。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为测量和改进科学评估的工具，为量化机器学习论文中的修辞风格提供了可靠方法，揭示了修辞风格对论文影响力的重要作用以及LLM写作辅助对学术写作风格的显著影响。

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于智能体的意见动态模型由于简化的同质性假设，无法捕捉驱动在线极化的心理异质性，这阻碍了对意识形态分歧放大机制的理解。

Method: 提出PRISM混合框架：使用随机微分方程(SDE)建模连续情感演化，结合人格条件部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(PC-POMDP)处理离散决策。基于MBTI人格类型为多模态大语言模型(MLLM)智能体分配认知策略，并通过大规模社交媒体数据初始化。

Result: PRISM在人格一致性方面显著优于标准同质模型和Big Five基准，与人类真实数据更一致。能够有效复现理性抑制和情感共鸣等涌现现象。

Conclusion: PRISM为分析复杂社交媒体生态系统提供了强大工具，通过整合心理异质性更好地理解在线极化机制。

Abstract: Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) of opinion dynamics often fail to capture the psychological heterogeneity driving online polarization due to simplistic homogeneity assumptions. This limitation obscures the critical interplay between individual cognitive biases and information propagation, thereby hindering a mechanistic understanding of how ideological divides are amplified. To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets. PRISM achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks. This framework effectively replicates emergent phenomena such as rational suppression and affective resonance, offering a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在对话系统中应用日益广泛，但其回应常带有微妙语调偏见（如过度礼貌、欢快或谨慎），这些偏见会影响用户对信任、同理心和公平性的感知，需要系统性地研究和检测。

Method: 1) 创建两个合成对话数据集：一个由中性提示生成，另一个明确引导产生积极或消极语调；2) 使用预训练的DistilBERT模型进行弱监督标注；3) 训练多个分类器检测语调模式；4) 采用集成模型提高检测性能。

Result: 1) 即使中性数据集也显示出一致的语调偏差，表明偏见可能源于模型底层对话风格；2) 集成模型实现了高达0.92的宏观F1分数，证明语调偏见是系统性、可测量且与设计公平可信对话AI相关。

Conclusion: 大语言模型存在系统性语调偏见，这种偏见可通过可控对话合成与语调分类模型集成进行有效检测，研究结果为设计更公平、可信的对话AI提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

TL;DR: 提出ThinkARM框架，将LLM推理轨迹抽象为功能推理步骤（分析、探索、实现、验证等），用于系统分析数学问题解决中的推理结构和动态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然展示推理轨迹，但难以识别和分析其底层认知结构和步骤，需要超越表面统计的中间尺度分析框架

Method: 采用Schoenfeld的Episode Theory作为归纳性中间尺度视角，提出ThinkARM框架，将推理轨迹抽象为功能性推理步骤，应用于不同模型的数学问题解决

Result: 揭示了推理模型与非推理模型之间可复现的思维动态和结构差异，发现探索步骤与正确性相关，效率导向方法选择性地抑制评估反馈步骤

Conclusion: 片段级表示使推理步骤显式化，能够系统分析现代语言模型中推理的结构、稳定性和变化方式

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

TL;DR: Memory-T1：基于强化学习的时间感知记忆选择框架，用于长对话历史中的时序推理，通过粗到细策略和三级奖励函数提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文模型在处理长对话历史时难以准确识别时序相关信息，导致推理性能显著下降。随着对话历史增长和噪声积累，时序推理能力成为对话代理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出Memory-T1框架，使用强化学习学习时间感知记忆选择策略。采用粗到细策略：先用时间和相关性过滤器将对话历史修剪为候选集，然后由RL代理选择精确的证据会话。RL训练采用三级奖励函数优化：答案准确性、证据基础和时序一致性。

Result: 在Time-Dialog基准测试中，Memory-T1将7B模型提升至67.0%的总体得分，创下开源模型的新SOTA，比14B基线高出10.2%。消融研究表明时序一致性和证据基础奖励共同贡献15.0%的性能提升。框架在128k tokens内保持鲁棒性，而基线模型已崩溃。

Conclusion: Memory-T1通过强化学习的时间感知记忆选择有效解决了长对话历史中的时序推理问题，显著提升了模型性能并保持对噪声的鲁棒性，为对话代理的时序推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Memory-T1/

TL;DR: TextGSL：一种新颖的图序列学习模型，通过构建多边类型文本图并集成Transformer层，解决现有GNN文本分类方法在结构信息利用和序列信息捕捉方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的文本分类方法存在两大局限：1）未能充分考虑词对间的多样化结构信息（如共现、句法、语义关系）；2）在文本图结构学习模块中忽略了序列信息，且无法处理包含新词和新关系的文本分类。

Method: 提出TextGSL模型：1）为每个文本构建单文本级图，基于词对间的多样化关系建立不同的边类型；2）设计自适应多边消息传递范式来聚合词对间的多样化结构信息；3）通过集成Transformer层来捕捉文本数据的序列信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TextGSL在准确率方面优于多个强基线模型。

Conclusion: TextGSL通过结合图神经网络和序列学习，能够学习更具判别性的文本表示，有效解决了现有GNN文本分类方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出ABBEL框架，通过语言表达的信念瓶颈来压缩长序列决策历史，使用RL后训练提升性能，在保持近恒定内存使用的同时超越完整上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列决策任务长度增加，在上下文中保持完整交互历史变得计算上不切实际，需要一种既能压缩历史又能保持性能的方法。

Method: ABBEL框架用信念状态（自然语言摘要）替代长交互历史，每步先更新信念再基于信念选择动作；通过RL后训练改进，包括信念质量评分和长度惩罚。

Result: ABBEL在六个多样化多步环境中保持近恒定内存使用和可解释信念，但初始性能低于完整上下文；RL训练后性能超越完整上下文，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: ABBEL框架通过信念瓶颈有效压缩上下文，RL训练能克服错误传播问题，在保持可解释性的同时实现优于完整上下文的性能和更低的内存使用。

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试上的广泛实验表明，M³KG-RAG显著提升了多模态大语言模型的多模态推理和基础能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M³KG-RAG通过构建多跳多模态知识图谱和引入精确的检索剪枝机制，有效解决了多模态RAG在音频-视觉领域的挑战，显著提升了模型的推理深度和答案忠实度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

Conclusion: EKA作为无需训练的多功能推理策略，可扩展到大型模型，在多样化数据集和检索语料库中表现出鲁棒性，推进了迭代RAG系统的最新进展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Motivation: 传统提示学习方法仍遵循参数化学习范式，存在记忆与泛化不平衡的问题，难以充分利用非典型实例，在有限数据下容易过拟合到浅层模式。

Method: RetroPrompt通过解耦知识与记忆，利用训练数据生成的公开知识库，在输入、训练和推理阶段引入检索机制，从语料库中主动检索相关上下文信息来增强可用线索。

Result: 在自然语言处理和计算机视觉任务的多数据集上，RetroPrompt在零样本和少样本场景中表现出优越性能，有效减少对死记硬背的依赖，提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: RetroPrompt通过检索增强的提示学习方法，成功平衡了记忆与泛化，为预训练基础模型的提示学习提供了更有效的范式。

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合语音-文本模型面临三个关键挑战：1) 语音标记（25Hz）和文本标记（~3Hz）之间的时间分辨率不匹配会稀释语义信息；2) 高计算成本；3) 导致文本LLM知识的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: Fun-Audio-Chat通过创新的双分辨率架构和多阶段后训练方法，成功解决了现有语音-文本模型的关键限制，在保持文本LLM知识的同时获得了强大的音频理解、推理和生成能力，无需大规模音频-文本预训练。

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

Motivation: LLMs在代码审查、内容审核等任务中表现出色，但研究发现它们容易受到隐藏在输入数据（如简历、代码）中的"对抗指令"操纵，导致偏离预期任务。虽然成熟领域（如代码审查）可能有防御措施，但在简历筛选、同行评审等常见应用中往往缺乏有效防护。

Method: 1) 引入基准测试评估LLMs在简历筛选中的对抗指令漏洞；2) 评估两种防御机制：基于提示的防御和提出的FIDS（通过分离检测外来指令）使用LoRA适配；3) 结合两种防御方法。

Result: 攻击成功率超过80%；基于提示的防御实现10.1%攻击减少但增加12.5%误拒率；FIDS实现15.4%攻击减少且仅增加10.4%误拒率；结合方法提供26.3%攻击减少，显示训练时防御在安全性和效用保持方面优于推理时缓解措施。

Conclusion: LLMs在简历筛选等应用中存在对抗指令漏洞，需要专门防御。训练时防御（如FIDS）比推理时防御更有效，结合多种防御方法能提供更好的安全保护。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

Conclusion: SlideTailor通过自然易得的用户输入隐式学习偏好，实现了用户对齐的个性化幻灯片生成，为自动内容创作提供了新思路

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: AprielGuard是一个8B参数的安全防护模型，统一处理安全风险和对抗性威胁，在多种基准测试中表现优于现有开源防护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在对话和代理场景中的部署增加，保护其免受不安全或对抗性行为变得至关重要。现有防护工具通常将安全风险（如毒性、偏见）和对抗性威胁（如提示注入、越狱）视为独立问题，限制了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AprielGuard模型，在单一分类和学习框架内统一处理安全维度。使用开放和合成数据的多样化混合进行训练，涵盖独立提示、多轮对话和代理工作流，并通过结构化推理轨迹增强可解释性。

Result: 在多个公共和专有基准测试中，AprielGuard在检测有害内容和对抗性操作方面表现出色，特别是在多步骤和推理密集型场景中，优于Llama-Guard和Granite Guardian等现有开源防护方案。

Conclusion: 通过发布该模型，旨在推进LLM可靠防护的透明和可重复研究，为统一的安全防护框架提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios. By releasing the model, we aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs在精神病学自我评估中表现出色，在波兰语自传叙述中诊断BPD和NPD时，Gemini Pro模型整体准确率比人类专家高21.91个百分点，但在NPD诊断上存在严重偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在精神病学自我评估中的应用日益增多，需要评估它们解释定性患者叙述的能力，特别是与心理健康专业人员的直接比较。

Method: 使用波兰语第一人称自传叙述，对最先进的LLMs和心理健康专业人员进行BPD和NPD诊断的直接比较，分析诊断准确性和定性特征。

Result: Gemini Pro模型整体诊断准确率65.48%，比人类专家43.57%高21.91个百分点；在BPD诊断上表现优异（F1=83.4 vs 80.0），但在NPD诊断上严重不足（F1=6.7 vs 50.0），模型对"自恋"这一价值负载术语表现出回避倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs在解释复杂的第一人称临床数据方面能力很强，但仍存在关键的可靠性和偏见问题，特别是在诊断价值负载的病症时，需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

TL;DR: SpidR是一种自监督语音表示模型，通过掩码预测、自蒸馏和在线聚类高效学习语音表示，在文本无关的语音语言建模任务上优于现有方法，且预训练时间大幅缩短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言建模和语音表示学习的并行发展，直接从语音学习语言而无需文本中介成为可能。这需要直接从语音中提取语义表示，但现有方法在语音单元质量和训练效率方面存在不足。

Method: 提出SpidR模型，在原始波形上使用掩码预测目标，结合自蒸馏和在线聚类进行训练。学生模型的中间层学习预测来自教师模型中间层的分配，这种学习目标稳定了在线聚类过程，产生更高质量的码本。

Result: SpidR在语言建模基准测试(sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC)上优于wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT、WavLM和DinoSR。系统评估了语音单元质量与语言建模性能的关联，验证了ABX和PNMI作为可靠代理指标。预训练时间从一周缩短到一天(16个GPU)。

Conclusion: SpidR通过创新的自蒸馏和在线聚类方法，实现了高质量的语音表示学习，在文本无关的语音语言建模任务上表现优异，同时大幅提高了训练效率，为直接从语音学习语言提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BanglaRiddleEval基准测试，包含1,244个孟加拉语谜语，通过四个任务评估LLMs在低资源比喻推理上的表现。结果显示当前模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在标准NLP基准上表现优异，但在比喻性、文化相关和低资源环境下的推理能力尚未充分探索。针对孟加拉语这一低资源语言，需要建立专门的评估基准。

Method: 使用LLM-based pipeline生成Chain-of-Thought解释、语义连贯的干扰项和细粒度歧义标注，在四种任务上评估开源和闭源模型，采用不同提示策略。

Result: 模型在生成式QA上有中等语义重叠但正确率低，多选题准确率最高仅约56%（人类基准83%），歧义解决率在26%-68%之间，高质量解释仅限于最强模型。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs能捕捉孟加拉语谜语推理的部分线索，但远未达到人类水平。BanglaRiddleEval成为低资源比喻推理的挑战性新基准，所有数据代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多视角验证框架，结合集成验证与双重可靠性指标（Cohen's Kappa和余弦相似度），用于评估LLM主题分析的可靠性，并在三种主流LLM上验证了该框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定性研究中的编码者间一致性评估方法需要多人参与、耗时且一致性通常不高，因此需要开发更高效可靠的AI辅助定性研究方法。

Method: 提出多视角验证框架，结合集成验证（1-6个种子，温度0.0-2.0）和双重可靠性指标：Cohen's Kappa用于评估编码者间一致性，余弦相似度用于评估语义一致性。支持自定义提示结构和变量替换，可从任何JSON格式中提取共识主题。

Result: 在三种主流LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet）上评估，每种模型进行6次独立运行。Gemini获得最高可靠性（κ=0.907，余弦相似度95.3%），其次是GPT-4o（κ=0.853，余弦相似度92.6%）和Claude（κ=0.842，余弦相似度92.1%）。所有模型均达到高一致性（κ>0.80）。Gemini识别出6个共识主题（一致性50-83%），GPT-4o识别出5个主题，Claude识别出4个主题。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助定性研究提供了可靠的方法学基础，通过开源实现为研究人员提供透明的可靠性指标、灵活配置和结构无关的共识提取功能。

Abstract: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.

TL;DR: 提出一个情感感知的文本摘要框架，将情感信号嵌入到抽取式（TextRank）和生成式（UniLM）方法中，以更好地处理社交媒体等非结构化文本的情感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体、评论和论坛等非结构化数据的快速增长，文本挖掘在信息系统（IS）中变得至关重要。现有摘要方法主要针对结构化新闻优化，难以处理嘈杂、非正式的社交媒体内容。情感线索对于品牌监控和市场分析等IS任务很关键，但很少有研究将情感建模整合到短文本用户生成内容的摘要中。

Method: 提出一个情感感知框架，扩展了抽取式（TextRank）和生成式（UniLM）方法，通过将情感信号嵌入到排名和生成过程中。这种双重设计能够更好地捕捉情感细微差别和主题相关性。

Result: 该框架能够产生简洁、情感丰富的摘要，增强了在动态在线环境中及时干预和战略决策的能力。

Conclusion: 情感感知的文本摘要框架能够有效处理社交媒体等非结构化文本，通过整合情感信号提升摘要质量，为信息系统中的品牌监控和市场分析等任务提供更好的支持。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准如BrowseComp无法满足开放研究任务的实际需求，开放研究需要强大的意图识别、长时程决策和跨源验证能力。同时，中文领域缺乏现实的深度研究评估基准。

Method: 提出Step-DeepResearch端到端智能体，采用基于原子能力的数据合成策略来增强规划和报告写作能力，结合从智能体中期训练到SFT和RL的渐进式训练路径，并通过清单式评判器提升鲁棒性。建立ADR-Bench中文深度研究评估基准。

Conclusion: 精细的训练方法使中等规模模型能够以行业领先的成本效益实现专家级能力，为开放研究任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于层重要性分数的简单高效层选择方法，用于将预训练softmax注意力Transformer蒸馏为混合架构，结合少量通用文本数据训练，比现有方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练的softmax注意力Transformer蒸馏为混合架构（交替使用softmax和线性注意力层）是提高LLM推理效率的可行方法，但关键挑战在于如何选择要转换为线性注意力的层。

Method: 使用少量通用文本数据训练得到的层重要性分数进行层选择，然后采用RADLADS蒸馏流程：注意力权重转移、隐藏状态对齐、基于KL散度的分布匹配，最后进行少量微调。

Result: 该方法比现有层选择方法更有效，包括基于固定比例均匀交错线性注意力的启发式方法，以及依赖专用诊断数据集的复杂方法。

Conclusion: 基于层重要性分数的简单层选择方法结合蒸馏流程，能够有效将预训练Transformer转换为混合架构，在保持性能的同时提高推理效率。

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

TL;DR: Gnosis：一种轻量级自感知机制，通过解码LLM内部状态实现自我验证，无需外部监督即可预测自身错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部评估、多样本一致性或文本自我批评，计算成本高且与真实正确性相关性弱。LLM能否通过推理过程中的内部状态预测自身失败？

Method: Gnosis被动观察LLM推理时的隐藏状态和注意力模式，将其压缩为固定预算描述符，仅添加约500万参数，独立于序列长度，以可忽略的计算成本预测正确性

Result: 在数学推理、开放域问答和学术知识基准测试中，从1.7B到20B参数的冻结骨干模型上，Gnosis在准确性和校准方面均优于强内部基线和大型外部评估器，并能零样本泛化到部分生成，实现早期失败检测

Conclusion: 可靠的正确性线索内在于生成过程，无需外部监督即可高效提取，为LLM自我验证提供了新途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

TL;DR: Cube Bench是一个基于魔方的多模态大语言模型基准测试，用于评估空间和序列推理能力，包含五个技能维度，测试结果显示模型性能随魔方复杂度增加而急剧下降，闭源模型优于开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要评估多模态大语言模型在空间和序列推理方面的能力，魔方问题提供了一个紧凑、可复现的测试平台，能够系统性地分解和测量模型在感知、决策、规划、执行和纠错等多个维度的表现。

Method: 创建Cube Bench基准测试，将魔方解构为五个技能：(1)从图像和文本重建魔方面，(2)选择最优下一步，(3)预测候选移动结果，(4)执行多步计划并从中断恢复，(5)检测和修正自身错误。使用共享的魔方状态、相同提示和解析器，以及单一的距离解决度量标准，比较不同MLLM在不同打乱深度下的表现。

Result: 七个MLLM的准确率随打乱深度急剧下降；一旦轨迹停滞或发散，模型很少能恢复；高面重建准确率不能保证有效的动作选择或多步执行。闭源与开源模型存在明显差距：最强的闭源模型在单步感知任务和多步控制任务上都领先，而开源模型在最困难设置下接近随机水平；即使最好的MLLM在更高魔方复杂度下也会退化。简单的自我校正通过反思思维带来适度改进，但也可能引入过度思考。

Conclusion: Cube Bench提供了一个紧凑、可复现的探针，用于评估MLLM中的序列空间推理能力，揭示了当前模型在复杂空间序列任务中的局限性，特别是开源模型与闭源模型之间的性能差距，以及模型在复杂场景下的恢复能力不足。

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: MoE-DiffuSeq通过专家混合架构和稀疏注意力机制，有效解决了扩散模型在长文本生成中的计算瓶颈，推动了高质量长文档生成的实际应用。

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型上下文分析的注意力距离度量方法，用于改进定向灰盒模糊测试，相比传统物理距离方法在38个真实漏洞复现实验中平均提升3.43倍测试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向灰盒模糊测试方法仅测量种子执行路径与目标位置之间的物理距离，忽略了代码段之间的逻辑关系，导致在复杂二进制文件中产生冗余或误导性指导，削弱了DGF的实际效果。

Method: 引入注意力距离这一新度量方法，利用大语言模型的上下文分析能力计算代码元素之间的注意力分数，揭示它们的内在联系。在相同的AFLGo配置下，仅将物理距离替换为注意力距离，不改变其他模糊测试组件。

Result: 在38个真实漏洞复现实验中，相比传统方法平均提升3.43倍测试效率；相比最先进的定向模糊测试器DAFL和WindRanger，分别提升2.89倍和7.13倍。将注意力距离集成到DAFL和WindRanger中也持续提升了它们的原始性能。

Conclusion: 注意力距离通过捕捉代码逻辑关系有效提升了定向模糊测试的效率，具有良好的通用性，能够持续改进现有最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: In the domain of software security testing, Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing (DGF) has garnered widespread attention for its efficient target localization and excellent detection performance. However, existing approaches measure only the physical distance between seed execution paths and target locations, overlooking logical relationships among code segments. This omission can yield redundant or misleading guidance in complex binaries, weakening DGF's real-world effectiveness. To address this, we introduce \textbf{attention distance}, a novel metric that leverages a large language model's contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements and reveal their intrinsic connections. Under the same AFLGo configuration -- without altering any fuzzing components other than the distance metric -- replacing physical distances with attention distances across 38 real vulnerability reproduction experiments delivers a \textbf{3.43$\times$} average increase in testing efficiency over the traditional method. Compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers DAFL and WindRanger, our approach achieves \textbf{2.89$\times$} and \textbf{7.13$\times$} improvements, respectively. To further validate the generalizability of attention distance, we integrate it into DAFL and WindRanger, where it also consistently enhances their original performance. All related code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/TheBinKing/Attention\_Distance.git.

TL;DR: 提出声明式系统，将智能体工作流规范与实现分离，使同一管道定义可在多种后端语言和部署环境中执行，显著降低开发时间和部署速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将智能体逻辑与特定编程语言和部署模型紧密耦合，导致构建部署就绪的LLM智能体需要复杂的工具、数据源和控制流逻辑编排。

Method: 通过统一领域特定语言（DSL）表达常见智能体工作流模式（数据序列化、过滤、RAG检索、API编排），将智能体开发从应用程序编程转变为配置管理。

Result: 在PayPal的真实电商工作流中，开发时间减少60%，部署速度提高3倍，非工程师可安全修改智能体行为，复杂工作流仅需50行DSL代码（相比500+行命令式代码）。

Conclusion: 声明式方法成功分离了智能体工作流规范与实现，实现了跨语言和环境的可移植性，显著提升了开发效率和部署灵活性，同时支持A/B测试和低延迟编排。

Abstract: Building deployment-ready LLM agents requires complex orchestration of tools, data sources, and control flow logic, yet existing systems tightly couple agent logic to specific programming languages and deployment models. We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises).
  Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison.
  We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead. We show that complex workflows involving product search, personalization, and cart management can be expressed in under 50 lines of DSL compared to 500+ lines of imperative code.

TL;DR: 提出基于CodeT5+的即时代码-注释不一致性检测方法，通过分解代码修改活动序列来捕捉代码变更与注释的相关性，在基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码与注释的语义一致性对程序理解、调试和维护至关重要。现有基于LLM的方法忽略了代码演化的结构复杂性，存在隐私和资源挑战，需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 基于CodeT5+骨干网络，将代码变更分解为替换、删除、添加等有序修改活动序列，以更有效地捕捉代码变更与过时注释之间的相关性。

Result: 在JITDATA和CCIBENCH基准数据集上，F1分数比现有SOTA模型提升高达13.54%，比微调的DeepSeek-Coder、CodeLlama和Qwen2.5-Coder等LLM提升4.18%-10.94%。

Conclusion: 提出的即时CCI检测方法通过建模代码修改活动序列，能更有效地检测代码-注释不一致性，显著优于现有方法，为代码维护提供有力工具。

Abstract: Ensuring semantic consistency between source code and its accompanying comments is crucial for program comprehension, effective debugging, and long-term maintainability. Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.

TL;DR: 论文研究了代码大语言模型的神经元级可解释性，发现存在语言特异性神经元和概念层，并展示了在代码生成、克隆检测和代码摘要等任务中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码语言模型在代码智能任务上表现出色，但其内部可解释性研究不足。现有的NLP神经元解释技术不适用于源代码，因为编程语言具有形式化、层次化和可执行的特点。

Method: 在神经元级别实证研究代码LLMs，定位语言特异性神经元（对特定语言有选择性响应）和概念层（编码语言无关代码表示的feed-forward层）。分析Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen2.5-Coder-32B在C++、Java、Python、Go和JavaScript多语言输入上的表现，测量神经元选择性和生成过程中的层间贡献。

Result: 发现：(1) 存在专门处理单个语言的神经元，同时存在支持通用生成的通用神经元子集；(2) 低层主要编码语言特定的语法，中层捕获跨语言共享的语义抽象，形成概念层。

Conclusion: 研究展示了神经元级分析在三个任务中的实用性：基于神经元指导的代码生成微调、通过概念层嵌入进行克隆检测、以及概念层指导的代码摘要迁移，每种方法在多语言设置中都取得了稳定提升。

Abstract: Code language models excel on code intelligence tasks, yet their internal interpretability is underexplored. Existing neuron interpretability techniques from NLP are suboptimal for source code due to programming languages formal, hierarchical, and executable nature. We empirically investigate code LLMs at the neuron level, localizing language-specific neurons (selectively responsive to one language) and concept layers (feed-forward layers encoding language-agnostic code representations). We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NoD-DGMT框架，用于检测具身智能体任务规划中的非最优决策问题，通过多样性引导的蜕变测试来发现任务完成但效率低下的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注功能正确性，忽视了生成计划的非功能性最优性，这可能导致显著的性能下降和资源浪费。作者识别并形式化了非最优决策问题，即智能体成功完成任务但效率低下。

Method: 提出了NoD-DGMT框架，采用多样性引导的蜕变测试方法。设计了四种新颖的蜕变关系来捕捉基本的最优性属性：位置绕路次优性、动作最优性完备性、条件细化单调性和场景扰动不变性。引入多样性引导的选择策略，主动选择探索不同违规类别的测试用例。

Result: 在AI2-THOR模拟器上对四种最先进的规划模型进行实验，NoD-DGMT平均达到31.9%的违规检测率。多样性引导过滤器将检测率提高了4.3%，多样性得分平均提高了3.3。NoD-DGMT显著优于六种基线方法，相对最佳基线提高了16.8%，在不同模型架构和任务复杂度上表现一致优越。

Conclusion: NoD-DGMT框架有效解决了具身智能体任务规划中的非最优决策检测问题，通过系统化的蜕变测试方法和多样性引导策略，能够高效发现效率低下的规划行为，为资源受限应用中的最优决策提供了重要保障。

Abstract: As embodied agents advance toward real-world deployment, ensuring optimal decisions becomes critical for resource-constrained applications. Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average. NoD-DGMT significantly outperforms six baseline methods, with 16.8% relative improvement over the best baseline, and demonstrates consistent superiority across different model architectures and task complexities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AXIOM是一个基于扰动的代码评估基准框架，通过规则引导的扰动和多源质量校准，生成具有平衡分数分布的代码评估数据集，解决现有基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码评估基准存在严重局限性：粗粒度二元标签将丰富代码行为简化为单比特信息；细粒度但主观模糊的评估标准导致人工标注不可靠；数据合成方法不受控制导致分数分布不平衡，无法代表真实代码生成场景。

Method: 提出AXIOM框架，包含两个阶段：1) 规则引导的扰动：使用LLM根据预定义扰动规则修改高质量程序，精确控制目标分数以实现平衡分布；2) 多源质量校准：选择高质量子集进行人工验证，确保基准可靠性。

Result: AXIOM能够大规模合成具有平衡分数分布的代码评估基准，提供更可靠、多样化的程序质量评估数据集，改进代码评估指标的验证能力。

Conclusion: AXIOM通过受控的扰动合成方法解决了现有代码评估基准的关键缺陷，为LLM生成的代码质量评估提供了更可靠、平衡的基准数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed in real-world software engineering, fostering the development of code evaluation metrics to study the quality of LLM-generated code. Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.
  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions. (2) Multisource quality calibration, which first selects a subset of...

TL;DR: 提出SysName方法，通过定位需要修复的位置和评估补丁质量，改进基于LLM的软件漏洞修复方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的漏洞修复方法存在两个主要局限：1) 忽略需要修复的位置信息，只关注修复内容；2) 在迭代过程中缺乏对生成候选补丁的质量评估

Method: 提出SysName方法，首先提供需要修复的位置信息，并通过评估测试失败补丁的质量来改进迭代修复策略。引入两个维度评估补丁质量：是否引入新漏洞和污点语句覆盖率

Result: 在VulnLoc+数据集（包含40个C/C++漏洞）上评估，SysName相比基于神经机器翻译、程序分析和LLM的最先进方法有显著改进。生成27个合理补丁，比基线多8-22个；在正确补丁生成方面，比现有方法多修复8-13个漏洞

Conclusion: SysName通过结合位置信息和补丁质量评估，显著提升了基于LLM的漏洞修复效果，在真实世界漏洞修复任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: The advances of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for automated software vulnerability repair approaches, which iteratively refine the patch until it becomes plausible. Nevertheless, existing LLM-based vulnerability repair approaches face notable limitations: 1) they ignore the concern of locations that need to be patched and focus solely on the repair content. 2) they lack quality assessment for generated candidate patches in the iterative process.
  To tackle the two limitations, we propose \sysname, an LLM-based approach that provides information about where should be patched first. Furthermore, \sysname improves the iterative repair strategy by assessing the quality of test-failing patches and selecting the best patch for the next iteration. We introduce two dimensions to assess the quality of patches: whether they introduce new vulnerabilities and the taint statement coverage. We evaluated \sysname on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset VulnLoc+, which contains 40 vulnerabilities and their Proofs-of-Vulnerability. The experimental results demonstrate that \sysname exhibits substantial improvements compared with the Neural Machine Translation-based, Program Analysis-based, and LLM-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approaches. Specifically, \sysname is able to generate 27 plausible patches, which is comparable to or even 8 to 22 more plausible patches than the baselines. In terms of correct patch generation, \sysname repairs 8 to 13 additional vulnerabilities compared with existing approaches.

TL;DR: FeatureSHAP：首个面向软件工程任务的自动化、模型无关可解释性框架，基于Shapley值，通过系统输入扰动和任务特定相似性比较，为LLM输出提供高层次特征归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在软件工程任务中表现出色，但其黑盒特性阻碍了在高风险安全关键领域的应用，现有可解释AI方法缺乏与软件工程实践者推理方式对齐的领域特定解释。

Method: 基于Shapley值，通过系统输入扰动和任务特定相似性比较，将模型输出归因于高层次输入特征，兼容开源和专有LLM，支持代码生成和代码摘要等双模态任务。

Result: FeatureSHAP相比基线方法，对不相关输入特征赋予更低重要性，产生更高保真度的解释；37名实践者调查显示，该框架帮助用户更好解释模型输出并做出更明智决策。

Conclusion: FeatureSHAP代表了软件工程实用可解释AI的重要进展，为LLM在软件工程中的透明应用提供了有效工具，有助于建立信任、问责和有效的人类监督。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially advanced the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling complex activities such as code generation and code summarization. However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP.

TL;DR: AI编码助手（GitHub Copilot和Cursor）会受到注释掉代码中缺陷的影响，导致生成更多有缺陷的代码，即使有明确忽略指令，缺陷减少也不超过21.84%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI编码助手在软件开发中的广泛应用，先前研究主要关注代码上下文对缺陷生成的影响，但忽略了注释掉代码（CO code）中缺陷的影响。AI助手对提示中注释掉代码的解读会影响其生成的代码质量。

Method: 研究评估了GitHub Copilot和Cursor两种AI编码助手如何受到有缺陷的注释掉代码的影响。通过实验分析AI助手在包含缺陷CO代码的上下文中的代码生成行为。

Result: 实验结果显示：1）上下文中的缺陷CO代码导致AI编码助手生成更多有缺陷的代码，最高达58.17%；2）AI助手不是简单复制缺陷代码，而是主动推理完成不完整的缺陷模式；3）即使存在错误缩进或标签等干扰，AI助手仍继续生成有缺陷的代码；4）即使明确指示忽略缺陷CO代码，缺陷减少也不超过21.84%。

Conclusion: AI编码助手容易受到注释掉代码中缺陷的影响，这表明需要改进AI编码助手的鲁棒性和安全措施，以减少缺陷传播风险。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models in code generation, AI-powered editors such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing software development practices. At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.
  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.

TL;DR: 首次对专用分布式深度学习框架进行大规模实证分析，研究DeepSpeed、Megatron-LM和Colossal-AI的849个真实问题，构建了包含34种bug症状、28种根本原因和6种修复模式的分类体系，揭示了分布式框架特有的挑战和解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据驱动时代，深度学习处理海量数据但单设备训练受计算和内存限制。分布式深度学习利用多GPU/机器并行训练，但通用框架（如TensorFlow、PyTorch）的分布式功能通常是附加功能，需要大量手动工作实现高级并行，因此需要专用分布式框架。然而，这些专用框架在实践中面临哪些挑战尚缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 对DeepSpeed、Megatron-LM和Colossal-AI三个专用分布式深度学习框架进行实证分析，收集849个真实世界问题（issues）。构建了包含34种bug症状、28种根本原因和6种修复模式的分类体系。建立了症状、原因和修复在不同分布式训练阶段之间的显式映射关系，系统理解问题如何出现和解决。

Result: 45.1%的bug症状是分布式框架特有的，其中设置失败、内存问题和性能异常最为普遍。95%的通信设置阶段问题仅出现在分布式环境中。超过60%的问题可以通过版本和依赖管理、分布式特性、API和通信调优来解决。

Conclusion: 专用分布式深度学习框架存在大量特有的挑战，特别是在通信设置阶段。通过系统性的分类和映射分析，为开发者提供了可操作的改进建议，包括更好的版本管理、API设计和通信优化策略。

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, deep learning is vital for processing massive datasets, yet single-device training is constrained by computational and memory limits. Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务化架构(SBA)在现代化遗留系统中受到关注，但定义适当规模的服务仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖文档、项目人员访问或预先知道目标服务数量等假设，这些在许多现实场景中并不成立。

Method: 提出Rake技术，基于深度强化学习，利用可用的系统文档和源代码在实现方法级别指导服务分解。该技术是语言无关的，支持可定制的目标函数，平衡模块化质量和业务能力对齐。

Result: 在四个开源遗留项目上应用Rake，并与两种最先进技术比较。平均而言，Rake实现了7-14%更高的模块化质量和18-22%更强的业务能力对齐。结果显示，仅优化业务上下文可能会在紧耦合系统中降低分解质量。

Conclusion: Rake通过强化学习方法有效解决了服务分解中的挑战，无需传统假设，实现了更好的模块化质量和业务能力对齐，强调了平衡目标的重要性。

Abstract: Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问题定位方法通常是Python中心化的单次搜索，难以处理大规模多语言代码库中自然语言错误描述到相关函数的映射问题。

Method: SweRank+包含两个组件：1) SweRankMulti：代码嵌入检索器和列表式LLM重排序器，使用多语言问题定位数据集训练；2) SweRankAgent：采用智能搜索循环，通过记忆缓冲在多轮中积累相关定位候选。

Result: 在多语言问题定位基准测试中，SweRankMulti达到新的SOTA性能，而SweRankAgent进一步提升了单次排序的定位效果。

Conclusion: SweRank+框架通过结合跨语言代码排序和多轮智能搜索，显著改进了大规模多语言代码库中的问题定位能力。

Abstract: Maintaining large-scale, multilingual codebases hinges on accurately localizing issues, which requires mapping natural-language error descriptions to the relevant functions that need to be modified. However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAN中逻辑功能与物理位置的绑定是静态的，在时变流量和资源条件下会导致效率低下。O-RAN解耦了传统RAN组件，但需要解决动态资源分配问题。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用GRLDyP方法（图神经网络辅助的深度强化学习）。GNN编码瞬时网络拓扑和资源利用率，DRL策略学习平衡服务等级、延迟和能耗。

Result: 在蒙特利尔24小时流量轨迹数据集上评估，动态O-CU选择和路由相比静态映射基线显著降低能耗，且不违反QoS约束。

Conclusion: 基于DRL的SFC配置是能源感知、资源自适应O-RAN部署的实用控制原语，动态资源分配能有效提升网络能效。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O RAN) disaggregates conventional RAN into interoperable components, enabling flexible resource allocation, energy savings, and agile architectural design. In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments.

Motivation: 现代电信网络数据量快速增长、规模不断扩大，对高可靠性要求日益提高。传统故障诊断方法在复杂网络环境中效率低下，无法满足对敏感和关键任务应用的快速准确故障检测需求。

Method: 在Kubernetes测试网络中故意注入多种网络错误（pod故障、pod终止、网络延迟、网络丢包、磁盘I/O故障），收集健康与故障状态下的数据，包括网络组件日志、系统描述、事件、RTT测试和pod状态信息，通过API微调GPT-4.1 nano模型。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4.1 nano模型在故障检测准确率上相比基础模型有显著提升，证明了LLM方法在网络故障管理中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的方法具有实现闭环、无需操作员的故障管理潜力，能够提高网络可靠性，降低服务提供商的停机相关运营成本。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of data volume in modern telecommunication networks and the continuous expansion of their scale, maintaining high reliability has become a critical requirement. These networks support a wide range of applications and services, including highly sensitive and mission-critical ones, which demand rapid and accurate detection and resolution of network errors. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods are no longer efficient for such complex environments.\cite{b1} In this study, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network fault detection and classification. Various types of network errors were intentionally injected into a Kubernetes-based test network, and data were collected under both healthy and faulty conditions. The dataset includes logs from different network components (pods), along with complementary data such as system descriptions, events, Round Trip Time (RTT) tests, and pod status information. The dataset covers common fault types such as pod failure, pod kill, network delay, network loss, and disk I/O failures. We fine-tuned the GPT-4.1 nano model via its API on this dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in fault-detection accuracy compared to the base model. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches for achieving closed-loop, and operator-free fault management, which can enhance network reliability and reduce downtime-related operational costs for service providers.

### [113] [Smoothing Rough Edges of IPv6 in VPNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19698)
*Yejin Cho,John Heidemann*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究发现商业VPN在IPv6处理上存在两大问题：IPv4-only VPN会泄露IPv6流量到ISP，损害用户隐私；双栈VPN中IPv6地址常被系统降级优先级，导致用户实际使用IPv4而非IPv6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究商业VPN如何与IPv6交互，揭示VPN在IPv6支持方面的缺陷。用户使用VPN部分原因是为了隐藏本地IP地址，但IPv6泄露会损害用户隐私。同时，了解为什么双栈VPN用户实际上选择IPv4而非IPv6。

Method: 使用WhatIsMyIPAddress.com网站的129k每日VPN用户数据集进行分析。测试了12个之前被认为安全的VPN，测量IPv6泄露情况。在Android上测试了6个VPN，分析IPv6地址优先级问题。提出解决方案：定义新的VPN专用IPv6地址范围，并在Linux上实现原型。

Result: 发现12个之前被认为安全的VPN仍有至少5%的用户存在IPv6泄露。IPv4-only VPN中5%-57%的用户会暴露原生IPv6地址。双栈VPN中，由于VPN分配地址常被系统降级优先级，5个VPN在Android上持续降低IPv6优先级，导致用户实际选择IPv4而非IPv6。

Conclusion: 商业VPN在IPv6支持方面存在严重缺陷：IPv4-only VPN会泄露IPv6流量损害隐私，双栈VPN中IPv6地址常被系统降级优先级。提出的新IPv6地址范围解决方案可解决优先级问题。研究有助于识别和解决VPN添加IPv6支持过程中的问题。

Abstract: How do commercial VPNs interact with IPv6? We show two "rough edges" in how commercial VPNs handle IPv6. First, we show that many IPv4-only VPNs leak IPv6 traffic to the ISP. Individual use VPNs in part to conceal their local IP addresses, so such leaks reduce user privacy. While prior work has studied VPNs in testbeds, we use a new dataset of 129k VPN-using daily visitors to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com that quantifies these leaks and show 12 VPNs previously considered safe still leak for at least 5% of their users. We show native IPv6 addresses leak most commonly in VPNs that claim only IPv4 support, with 5% to 57% of visitors of v4-only VPNs having their native IPv6 address exposed. Second, we show that most dual-stack VPNs users actually select IPv4 instead of IPv6. We observe this problem in our visitor data, and we identify the root cause arises because when user's computer follows standard address-selection rules, VPN-assigned addresses are often de-preferenced. Testing six VPNs on Android, we show that five consistently de-prioritize IPv6. Finally, we suggest a solution to IPv6 de-preferencing: we define a new IPv6 address range for VPNs that is not de-preferenced by address selection. We prototype this solution on Linux. Our findings help identify and address rough edges in the addition of IPv6 support to VPNs.

Motivation: 现有NOMA-ISAC研究未能充分解决全息近场传播、RSMA集成干扰管理和实际损伤下的统计验证问题，需要为6G全息MIMO ISAC部署建立严谨基础。

Method: 提出统一近场建模（空间相关瑞利衰落、球面波前传播、亚波长天线耦合效应）；RS-NOMA架构实现感知与通信间的灵活干扰管理；多目标优化套件（HAO-SCA、WMMSE、SDR、FP、DRL）；5000次蒙特卡洛运行的严格统计验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际6G全息MIMO ISAC部署建立了严谨基础，展示了RS-NOMA在集成感知与通信中的显著性能优势。

Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with extremely large apertures enable transformational capabilities for sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) ISAC works inadequately address: (i) holographic near-field propagation with sub-wavelength antenna spacing; (ii) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integration for interference management; (iii) statistical validation under realistic impairments. This paper presents a comprehensive holographic MIMO NOMA-ISAC framework featuring: \textbf{(1)} Unified near-field modeling incorporating spatially-correlated Rayleigh fading, spherical wavefront propagation, and sub-wavelength antenna coupling effects; \textbf{(2)} Novel rate-splitting enhanced NOMA (RS-NOMA) architecture enabling flexible interference management between sensing and communication; \textbf{(3)} Multi-objective optimization suite comparing hybrid alternating optimization with successive convex approximation (HAO-SCA), weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), fractional programming (FP), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL); \textbf{(4)} Rigorous statistical validation over 5000 Monte Carlo runs with significance testing across massive MIMO scenarios (up to 1024 antennas). Results demonstrate that RS-NOMA achieves \SI{11.7}{\percent} higher sum-rate than conventional NOMA and \SI{18.8}{\percent} over WMMSE at matched sensing utility. Sensing CRLB improvements of \SI{2.4}{\decibel} are confirmed with 99\% statistical confidence. The framework establishes rigorous foundations for practical 6G holographic MIMO ISAC deployment.

TL;DR: Jazz：一种解耦架构的多路径TCP拥塞控制系统，使用Transformer智能体处理历史观测序列以解决部分可观测性问题，在Wi-Fi测试中提升带宽效率2.85%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多路径TCP虽能提升服务质量，但其拥塞控制演进受限于OS内核的单体架构（开发成本高、资源灵活性不足），且网络统计噪声导致部分可观测性问题会误导数据驱动方法

Method: 提出Jazz系统：1）采用解耦架构，将决策"大脑"与内核数据路径分离，使其能在外部（边缘）实体运行；2）核心使用基于Transformer的智能体，处理历史观测序列以克服单步强化学习的部分可观测性

Result: 在双频（5GHz/6GHz）Wi-Fi测试平台上，Jazz比传统方法提升带宽效率至少2.85%，在1%丢包率下仍保持96.2%性能，验证了该设计作为敏捷网络智能实用蓝图的可行性

Conclusion: Jazz通过解耦架构和Transformer序列处理成功解决了多路径TCP拥塞控制的演进障碍和部分可观测性问题，为网络智能提供了实用且高效的实现方案

Abstract: Multipath TCP is widely adopted to enhance connection quality-of-service by leveraging multiple network pathways on modern devices. However, the evolution of its core congestion control is hindered by the OS kernel, whose monolithic design imposes high development overhead and lacks the resource flexibility required for data-driven methods. Furthermore, inherent noise in network statistics induces a partial observability problem, which can mislead data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning. To bridge this gap, we propose Jazz, a system that re-architects multipath congestion control through a decoupled architecture that separates the decision-making ``brain'' from the in-kernel datapath, enabling it to operate on an external (edge) entity. At its core, Jazz employs a Transformer-based agent that processes sequences of historical observations to overcome the partial observability of single-step reinforcement learning. This allows it to learn and master fluctuating link conditions and intricate cross-path dependencies. Tested on a dual-band (5GHz/6GHz) Wi-Fi testbed, our implementation improves bandwidth efficiency by at least 2.85\% over conventional methods and maintains 96.2\% performance under 1\% packet loss, validating this design as a practical blueprint for agile network intelligence.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种双目标优化方法，用于灾后人道主义物流中的救援物资分配与车辆路径规划，平衡效率与公平性，通过分支定价算法显著提升求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重大灾害中，预先储备的救援物资往往无法满足所有需求，需要在有限物资条件下规划车辆路线并分配救援物资，同时平衡配送效率与分配公平性。

Method: 建立混合整数规划模型，采用ε-约束法处理双目标优化（最小化基于基尼系数的不公平性指标和总旅行时间），推导最优解数学性质，引入有效不等式，设计给定可行车辆路线的最优配送分配算法，开发分支定价算法。

Result: 在土耳其凡城地震实际数据和伊斯坦布尔卡塔尔地区预测数据上的计算测试表明，分支定价算法显著优于商业MIP求解器，双目标方法在不影响效率的情况下将援助分配不公平性降低了34%。

Conclusion: 当时间约束非常宽松或严格时，优先考虑需求覆盖的词典序优化有效；对于中等限制的时间约束，平衡方法对避免不公平结果至关重要。

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Motivation: 大语言模型能模拟人类行为，但为每个人格特征创建提示词会增加实验开销并降低可复现性，需要更高效的方法来模拟人格对决策的影响

Method: 采用插值解码技术，将人格的每个维度表示为一对相反的提示词，通过插值参数在维度上模拟行为，系统搜索插值空间来匹配人类玩家的行为

Conclusion: 插值解码为使用LLM模拟人类人格和行为提供了高效、可复现的方法，能够系统探索人格对决策的影响并匹配个体人类行为

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Conclusion: 提出的基于类别原型和分割ViT的方法能够有效实现从单物种分类到多标签植被地块分类的领域适应，在细粒度多标签物种识别任务中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

TL;DR: 提出LieFlow方法，通过李群上的流匹配从数据中学习对称性，能够发现离散群等复杂对称结构，并解决了"最后一刻收敛"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性对理解物理系统和提升机器学习性能都很重要，但需要知道数据中的底层对称性。现有方法在发现对称性方面存在局限，需要更灵活的方法直接从数据中学习对称性。

Method: 提出LieFlow方法，将对称性发现定义为在李群上学习分布，使学习到的分布与数据中观察到的对称性匹配。使用流匹配技术，并针对对称性发现中的"最后一刻收敛"问题，提出了新的插值方案。

Conclusion: LieFlow方法能够直接从数据中学习对称性，比先前方法更灵活且假设更少，为解决对称性发现问题提供了有效途径，特别是在处理复杂对称结构方面表现出色。

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

TL;DR: G-SPEC是一个神经符号框架，通过确定性验证约束概率规划，解决5G/6G网络中LLM代理的随机风险问题，实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向5G独立组网和6G演进，运营商面临超出静态自动化和深度强化学习极限的编排挑战。虽然大型语言模型代理为实现意图驱动网络提供了路径，但它们引入了拓扑幻觉和政策不合规等随机风险。

Method: 提出Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC)神经符号框架，通过治理三元组约束概率规划：电信适配代理(TSLAM-4B)、网络知识图谱(NKG)和SHACL约束。该架构结合确定性验证来约束LLM的随机规划。

Result: 在模拟的450节点5G核心网上评估，实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率，显著优于82.4%的基线。消融分析显示NKG验证贡献了68%的安全增益，SHACL策略贡献24%。在10K到100K节点的拓扑上，验证延迟按O(k^1.2)扩展，处理开销142ms，适合SMO层操作。

Conclusion: G-SPEC通过神经符号方法有效缓解了LLM代理在网络编排中的随机风险，实现了可扩展的安全策略执行，为5G/6G网络的意图驱动自动化提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以转化为低级动作，而潜在动作模型缺乏高层规划能力，需要桥接视频学习与机器人动作执行之间的差距

Method: 通过光流中间表示学习潜在技能空间，该表示能捕捉与视频动态和机器人动作对齐的运动信息，实现从原始视觉数据直接获取和组合技能

Result: 在多任务和长时域设置中一致提升性能，验证了直接从原始视觉数据获取和组合技能的能力

Conclusion: SOF框架成功桥接了视频学习与机器人动作执行，通过光流表示学习技能实现了高层规划与动作转化的有效结合

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Motivation: 气候变化导致极端天气灾害频发，快速准确的灾害位置识别对应急响应和资源分配至关重要，现有方法在可解释性和准确性方面有待改进。

Method: 提出ProbGLC概率跨视角地理定位框架，将概率模型和确定性模型统一，通过不确定性量化和局部化评分增强模型可解释性，支持多种灾害类型的跨视角图像匹配。

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统研究强化学习在内容审核中的规模化应用，发现RL在需要复杂政策推理的任务上表现优异，数据效率比监督微调高100倍，特别适用于标注稀缺场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模内容审核是数字生态系统中最紧迫的挑战之一，现有LLM在政策导向审核方面虽有潜力，但在实际应用中面临标签稀疏、政策定义演变、需要超越浅层模式匹配的细微推理等挑战，这些实际困难尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用全面的实证研究方法，系统评估多种RL训练方案和奖励塑造策略，包括可验证奖励和LLM作为评判框架，将通用语言模型转化为专门的政策对齐分类器，在三个真实世界内容审核任务上进行测试。

Result: RL表现出类似Sigmoid函数的缩放行为，性能随训练数据、rollouts和优化步骤增加而平滑提升后逐渐饱和；在需要复杂政策推理的任务上显著提升性能，数据效率比监督微调高100倍，特别适用于专家标注稀缺或成本高的领域。

Conclusion: RL为工业级内容审核系统提供了可行的解决方案，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下，通过适当的奖励塑造和规模化训练，能够实现专家级准确度的政策对齐分类器。

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide是一个两阶段训练框架，用于解决临床决策支持系统中预测准确性与解释对齐的问题，通过减少暴露偏差和任务分离，使用更小的模型实现高性能的预测和解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床决策支持系统面临关键挑战：在实现高预测准确性的同时，生成与预测一致的解释。现有方法存在暴露偏差问题，导致解释与预测不对齐。

Method: 提出Reason2Decide两阶段训练框架：第一阶段训练模型生成解释；第二阶段联合训练标签预测和解释生成，应用计划采样从基于黄金标签逐步过渡到基于模型预测。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上评估，Reason2Decide在预测（F1）和解释保真度（BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge）方面优于其他微调基线和一些零样本LLM。在分诊任务中，对LLM生成、护士撰写和护士后处理的解释都表现稳健。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide使用比当代基础模型小40倍的模型实现了这些优势，使临床推理在资源受限部署中更加可访问，同时仍提供可解释的决策支持。LLM生成的解释适合预训练模型，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Conclusion: 结合指令微调LLM、动态反馈和强化学习的方法具有构建稳健、市场感知的金融情感模型的潜力，能够有效适应市场行为。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进性质同时保持化学有效性和结构相似性。现有方法缺乏将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题的框架，无法让LLM智能体学习交错推理、工具使用和分子优化。

Method: 提出MolAct框架，将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题，采用两阶段训练范式：第一阶段建立编辑能力，第二阶段重用学习到的编辑行为进行性质优化。智能体可以多轮交互，调用化学工具进行有效性检查、性质评估和相似性控制，并利用反馈优化后续编辑。具体实例化了MolEditAgent（分子编辑）和MolOptAgent（分子优化）两个模型家族。

Result: 在分子编辑任务中，MolEditAgent-7B在添加、删除和替换编辑上分别达到100%、95%和98%的有效性，优于DeepSeek-R1等基线；MolEditAgent-3B性能接近Qwen3-32B-think等更大模型。在分子优化任务中，MolOptAgent-7B在LogP指标上超越Claude 3.7等最佳基线，在溶解度上保持竞争力，并在其他目标上保持平衡性能。

Conclusion: 将分子设计视为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠且可解释改进的关键。MolAct框架首次将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题，展示了智能体学习交错推理、工具使用和分子优化的有效性。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有完全冻结的LLM（无需微调）在时间序列预测中性能对输入数据的文本表示高度敏感，因为其参数无法适应分布偏移。需要一种简单有效的方法来克服这种脆弱性。

Method: 在时间序列数据tokenization之前向原始数据注入噪声，作为一种非侵入式的推理时增强方法，迫使冻结的LLM基于稳健的底层时序模式进行外推，而非依赖表面的数值伪影。

Result: 通过理论分析和多个基准测试的实证验证，该方法能显著提升性能。特别引入了两个全新的时间序列数据集（确保不在LLM预训练范围内），在这些数据集上也观察到一致的性能改进。

Conclusion: 噪声注入是一种简单有效的策略，能够增强冻结LLM在时间序列预测中的鲁棒性，为直接利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测提供了进一步进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Motivation: 数据中心能耗巨大且碳足迹显著，边缘计算和AI发展进一步推动存储需求。提高能源效率对应对气候变化、降低成本、增强竞争力至关重要。PUE是衡量数据中心运行效率的关键指标，准确预测PUE有助于识别影响能耗的关键因素并进行针对性优化。

Conclusion: BiGRU模型能够有效预测数据中心PUE值，为能源效率优化提供可靠工具。通过特征选择和模型优化，可以准确识别影响能耗的关键因素，指导数据中心进行针对性节能改造，促进IT和环境可持续发展。

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Conclusion: 通过直接从偏好和安全标签学习策略，避免了奖励和成本模型的误差累积问题，为长时域连续控制任务提供了一种有效的安全离线偏好强化学习方法

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents.

*Xingbo Du,Loka Li,Duzhen Zhang,Le Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR³是一个用于LLM代理的自主内存检索系统，通过路由器机制和全局证据追踪实现闭环控制，显著提升回答质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内存系统主要优化压缩和存储，缺乏对内存检索的显式闭环控制，需要更自主、准确和兼容的内存检索机制

Method: 设计MemR³系统，包含两个核心机制：1）路由器选择检索、反思或回答动作；2）全局证据-差距追踪器使回答过程透明化并追踪证据收集过程

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中超越强基线，在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上表现优异，显著改进现有检索器（RAG +7.29%，Zep +1.94%），提供即插即用的内存存储控制器

Conclusion: MemR³通过引入闭环控制机制实现自主决策，为现有内存存储提供有效的即插即用控制器，显著提升LLM代理的回答质量

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

TL;DR: ActionFlow：针对边缘设备上VLA模型推理延迟问题的系统级优化框架，通过跨请求流水线调度和内存优化技术，在不重新训练的情况下实现2.55倍FPS提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在边缘设备上推理延迟高（仅3-5Hz），无法满足机器人实时控制需求（20-30Hz），现有优化方法要么需要大量重新训练，要么会牺牲模型精度

Method: 提出ActionFlow系统级推理框架，核心是跨请求流水线策略，将VLA推理重构为微请求的宏流水线，智能批处理内存绑定的解码阶段和计算绑定的预填充阶段，同时提出跨请求状态打包前向算子和统一KV环形缓冲区来优化内存操作

Result: 在OpenVLA-7B模型上实现了2.55倍的FPS提升，使边缘硬件能够支持实时动态操作，无需重新训练模型

Conclusion: ActionFlow通过系统级优化成功解决了VLA模型在边缘设备上的推理延迟问题，为实时机器人控制提供了可行的解决方案，且保持模型精度不变

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过科学方法论（假设、探测、编码）使LLM从被动工具使用者转变为主动工作流架构师，解决代码技能自动生成中的四个结构性瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CodeMem确立了可执行代码作为代理程序记忆的最佳表示形式，但从空白状态自主合成这种记忆的机制仍未充分探索。需要将大语言模型从被动工具使用者转变为主动工作流架构师。

Method: 通过Outlook和OneDrive跨服务编排任务的高保真案例研究，识别并解决自动技能生成中的四个结构性瓶颈：发现差距（导航大型工具注册表）、验证差距（工具响应结构的基础）、分解差距（用线性状态锚定替代低效搜索）和扩展差距（并发和持久性）。强制执行假设、探测、编码的科学方法论。

Result: 代理能够自主编写健壮、生产级的代码技能，成功解决了跨服务编排任务中的四个结构性瓶颈。

Conclusion: 通过科学方法论和解决四个关键瓶颈，大语言模型可以实现从被动工具使用者到主动工作流架构师的转变，自主生成生产级的代码技能。

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

TL;DR: SynCraft：基于大语言模型推理的分子可合成性优化框架，通过原子级编辑而非SMILES生成，解决生成分子难以合成的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在化学空间探索中面临关键瓶颈：大量生成分子难以合成。现有方法如后过滤或模板投影会损害结构新颖性或破坏关键药效团

Method: 将可合成性优化重构为精确的结构编辑问题而非序列翻译任务，利用大语言模型的推理能力预测可执行的原子级编辑序列，避免SMILES生成的语法脆弱性

Result: 在基准测试中超越现有方法，能生成高结构保真度的可合成类似物；通过交互感知提示成功复制药物化学专家直觉，编辑PLK1抑制剂并挽救先前被丢弃的RIPK1候选分子

Conclusion: SynCraft框架有效解决了"合成悬崖"问题，通过最小结构修改实现合成可行性显著提升，为生成式AI在药物发现中的应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Motivation: 工业仿真系统需要将视觉布局和自然语言描述转化为可执行代码，传统方法缺乏跨模态推理能力，无法有效整合视觉理解和语言理解。

Method: 提出Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM)，构建首个大规模生成式数字孪生数据集（12万+提示-草图-代码三元组），设计三种新颖评估指标：结构有效性率(SVR)、参数匹配率(PMR)和执行成功率(ESR)。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成式数字孪生奠定了基础，将视觉推理和语言理解整合到可执行的工业仿真系统中。

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Motivation: AI智能体正在成为运行多步骤科学工作流的实用方式，但规模化智能体科学面临诸多挑战：工作流难以观察和复现、许多工具和实验室系统不兼容智能体、执行难以追踪和治理、原型系统通常是定制化的限制了重用和系统改进。

Method: 提出Bohrium+SciMaster架构：Bohrium作为AI4S资产的托管可追踪中心（类似科学AI的HuggingFace），将科学数据、软件、计算和实验室系统转化为智能体就绪能力；SciMaster将这些能力编排为长视野科学工作流；中间的科学智能基板组织可重用模型、知识和组件，形成可执行构建块。

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）与小型语言模型（SLMs）在预测危重患者休克方面的性能，发现尽管GatorTron-Base获得最高加权召回率80.5%，但整体性能相当，表明LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理领域广泛应用，但在预测任务中的应用研究较少。本研究旨在比较LLMs与传统SLMs在预测危重患者休克方面的性能，探索LLMs在临床预测任务中的实际价值。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294个ICU住院记录，筛选出住院时间>24小时且休克指数(SI)>0.7的患者，得到355名正常SI和87名异常SI患者。比较了GatorTron-Base（临床数据训练）、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等SLMs。使用焦点损失和交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron-Base获得最高加权召回率80.5%，但LLMs和SLMs的整体性能指标相当。这表明LLMs在预测未来临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs，尽管LLMs在文本任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床预测任务中并不比SLMs更具优势。未来LLMs训练应专注于开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而不是简单的命名实体识别或表型分类任务，以实现有意义的临床结果。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Method: 开发SAGE LLM规划代理，比较思维链推理模型与无推理模型在41例脑转移患者中的计划生成效果，分析优化轨迹作为审计日志

Result: 推理模型在主要终点上与人工规划相当(p>0.21)，但显著降低耳蜗剂量(p=0.022)，并展示前瞻性约束验证和权衡审议等系统性规划行为

Conclusion: 思维链推理可提高AI规划的可解释性和临床适用性，优化轨迹提供透明审计路径，推动自动化治疗规划向临床转化

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Conclusion: 多智能体框架通过协调定位和视觉智能体，在长视频QA中实现了更好的时间定位、视觉细节补充和可解释轨迹，强化学习进一步优化了多智能体协作效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前研究主要关注英语社区的Community Notes，缺乏对不同语言社区如何利用这一众包事实核查机制的理解，需要评估这种模式是否能在不同语言环境中替代专业事实核查组织。

Method: 研究分析了不同语言社区在X的Community Notes项目中的参与情况，特别关注志愿者对专业事实核查资源的依赖程度在不同语言间的差异。

Result: 1. Community Notes在某些语言社区中接受度很高，但在其他社区中未能普及；2. 引用专业事实核查的笔记被认为更有帮助；3. 总体而言，对专业事实核查的依赖度仍然很低。

Conclusion: 众包事实核查在不同语言社区中效果不一，虽然专业事实核查资源能提升笔记质量，但志愿者整体上很少依赖这些资源，这限制了Community Notes作为专业事实核查替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Crowd-sourced fact-checking provides social media platforms with a promising method of managing misinformation at scale. However, the success of fact-checking programs like X's Community Notes requires the participation of a critical mass of note-writers who have the time and epistemic resources necessary to write and rate high-quality notes. As X's Community Notes program was first established in English-speaking countries, much academic research has focused on English-language notes or notes writ large. Relatively little research has investigated how different linguistic communities utilise Community Notes. Thus, it is unclear whether Community Notes or similar crowd-sourced fact-checking initiatives represent a viable alternative to social media platforms' partnerships with professional fact-checking organisations across linguistic contexts. This research identifies how different linguistic communities participate in volunteer fact-checking efforts on X's Community Notes program and addresses volunteers' reliance on professional fact-checking resources differs across languages. We find that while the Community Notes program has had strong uptake in some linguistic communities, the program has failed to catch on in others. Additionally, we confirm findings that notes that cite professional fact-checkers are considered more helpful, but show that reliance on professional fact-checking overall remains minimal.

Motivation: 在线平台上有毒内容的传播带来了复杂挑战，需要理论洞察和实用工具来测试干预策略。现有方法缺乏对用户心理特征和个性化审核的系统性研究。

Method: 扩展经典的SEIZ（易感-暴露-感染-怀疑）流行病模型，开发模拟框架。引入两种审核机制：基础审核员（统一非个性化干预）和智能审核员（基于黑暗三联征心理特征的用户个性化阈值驱动审核）。通过参数配置系统探索不同审核策略对用户状态转变的影响。

Conclusion: 该模拟框架为研究和设计复杂在线社交系统中的自适应审核策略提供了灵活可扩展的工具，证明了用户心理特征在内容审核中的重要性。

Abstract: The spread of toxic content on online platforms presents complex challenges that call for both theoretical insight and practical tools to test intervention strategies. In this novel research paper, we introduce a simulation-based framework that extends the classical SEIZ (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Skeptic) epidemic model to capture the dynamics of toxic message propagation. Our simulator incorporates active moderation mechanisms through two distinct variants: a basic moderator, which implements uniform, non-personalized interventions, and smart moderator, which leverages user-specific psychological profiles based on Dark Triad traits to apply personalized, threshold-driven moderation. By varying parameter configurations, the simulator allows for systematic exploration of how different moderation strategies influence user state transitions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that while generic interventions can curb toxicity under certain conditions, profile-aware moderation proves significantly more effective in limiting both the spread and persistence of toxic behavior. This simulation framework offers a flexible and extensible tool for studying and designing adaptive moderation strategies in complex online social systems.
