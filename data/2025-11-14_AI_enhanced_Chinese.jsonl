Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u4f4e\u751f\u80b2\u7387\uff09\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u8bf4\u4e0d\u591f\u7406\u60f3\u3002\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u62e5\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although Grokipedia articles are much longer than their corresponding English Wikipedia articles, we find that much of Grokipedia's content (including both articles with and without Creative Commons licenses) is highly derivative of Wikipedia. Nevertheless, citation practices between the sites differ greatly, with Grokipedia citing many more sources deemed \"generally unreliable\" or \"blacklisted\" by the English Wikipedia community and low quality by external scholars, including dozens of citations to sites like Stormfront and Infowars. We then analyze article subsets: one about elected officials, one about controversial topics, and one random subset for which we derive article quality and topic. We find that the elected official and controversial article subsets showed less similarity between their Wikipedia version and Grokipedia version than other pages. The random subset illustrates that Grokipedia focused rewriting the highest quality articles on Wikipedia, with a bias towards biographies, politics, society, and history.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedeCouple\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u8f93\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5f31\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedeCouple\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u683c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedeCouple\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e5d\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cFedeCouple\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u51fa4.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedeCouple\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "See and Beam\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba4\u5185\u81ea\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u955c\u9762\u8868\u9762\u589e\u5f3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u955c\u9762\u8868\u9762\uff08\u5982\u73bb\u7483\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u9762\u677f\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u9762\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u7ebf\u548c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u90e8\u7f72\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\uff08\u5149\u6ed1\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u54d1\u5149\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LiDAR/\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8054\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u3002\u5229\u7528LiDAR-\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5171\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u4f7fLiDAR\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6620\u5c04\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u572860 GHz\u9891\u6bb5\uff0cLiDAR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u4f7f\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620 dB\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002LiDAR\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u89d2\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a77\u4e3e\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u914d\u7f6e\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u672a\u67656G\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8fde\u63a5\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u7ec4\u800c\u975e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u3001DeepSeek-Chat\u548cClaude-3.5-Haiku\uff09\u5728ClassEval\u57fa\u51c6\u7684100\u4e2aPython\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u4e0b\u964d37.8%\uff0cDeepSeek-Chat\u4e0b\u964d39.8%\uff09\uff0cClaude-3.5-Haiku\u662f\u4f8b\u5916\uff08\u63d0\u53479.5%\uff09\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9519\u8bef\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation", "comment": "Accepted in IEEE BigData 2025", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost.

To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u5177\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8282\u70b9\u6846\u67b6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4f1a\u52a0\u901f\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u5bb6\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u653e\u5927\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7269\u8bbe\u5b9a\u91cd\u5199\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u7b54\u5f0f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u8425\u9500\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u52a0\u901f\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u5bb6\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u5931\u771f\u540e\uff0c\u5f02\u8d28\u4ee3\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u5ba3\u4f20\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u65e2\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316Wi-Fi\u7684\u4ecb\u8d28\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u63a5\u5165\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7a97\u53e3\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "IEEE 802.11\u7684\u9759\u6001\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u8c31\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u5305\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684MAC\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u5206\u89e3\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5206\u522b\u7531\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587MAB\u7b97\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5171\u5b58\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587MAB\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9759\u6001IEEE 802.11\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences.

We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory.

PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels.

However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\\%$ and $99\\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete.

Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "P4-TAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eP4\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea4\u6362\u673aASIC\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Time-Aware Shaper\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301DetNet\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684MPLS/TSN\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1aTSN\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u516c\u5f00\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u5982\u961f\u5217\u5f00\u542f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528P4\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea4\u6362ASIC\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0TAS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u7684TAS\u63a7\u5236\u5e27\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u961f\u5217\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u7eb3\u79d2\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86P4-TAS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301400 Gb/s\u9ad8\u901f\u8f6c\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684MPLS/TSN\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709TAS\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "P4-TAS\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5546\u4e1aTSN\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5185\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301DetNet\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u8f6c\u53d1\u3002"}}

We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f14\u8fdbAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u7740\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u6f14\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u8868\u8fbe\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u516c\u5171\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6f14\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative.

Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective.

In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u3002"}}

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u884c\u4e1a\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf9108\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u4e0e\u884c\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u4fee\u8865\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u884c\u4e1a\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u672f\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency.

This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports.

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Rebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u514d\u53d7\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u5728\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7fARMs\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "Rebellion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Rebellion\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\\% to 76.4\\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency.

Supplementary material included", "summary": "Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting.

To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation.

We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset.

Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.\n  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f308\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\u4f46\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnchTable\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NTK-based\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f26\u7406\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838(NTK)\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cEnchTable\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EnchTable\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8679\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5404\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8679\u819c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5e7f\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4ee3\u8868\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u6837\u672c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6240\u9700\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GAN\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7GAN\u53cd\u6f14\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u3002"}}

However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value.

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePANDA\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6(KC)\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KC\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6(KC)\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f\u3001\u751f\u6210KC\u5197\u4f59\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u5728646\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\"\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\"\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59KC\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cbLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)\uff0c\u751f\u6210569\u4e2aKC(\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3a101\u4e2a)\u3002\u4f7f\u75280.8\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5408\u5e76\u540e\uff0cKC\u6570\u91cf\u964d\u81f3428\u4e2a\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4e3aKC\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86REAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6f5c\u5728\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\uff08REAP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08SP\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08FE\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u3002SP\u7ef4\u62a4\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\uff1bFE\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u591a\u8df3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "REAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumos3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u59ff\u60013D\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u6216\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u65e0\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7167\u660e\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u901a\u75283D\u4f4e\u5149\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5e38\u5149\u7167\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u7167\u660e\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5149\u7167\u771f\u503c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u7528\u7684Lumos\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91cd\u5efa3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLumos3D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4e\u51493D\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Lumos3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d3D\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fc7\u66dd\u5149\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7167\u660e\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u753b\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5c063DGS\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u4eba\u4f53\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9e\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scannet++\u548cSuperSplat\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a00\u758f/\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGS\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea7\u5d29\u6e83\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684Soft Constrained Decoding\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89e3\u7801\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Constrained Decoding (SCD)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6e29\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSCD\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.", "AI": {"tldr": "CertMask\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8f6e\u63a9\u7801\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u4ee5\u7269\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u8f6e\u63a9\u7801\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "CertMask\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5145\u5206\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u4e2d\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4f4d\u7f6e\u81f3\u5c11\u88ab\u8986\u76d6k\u6b21\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u8f6e\u63a9\u7801\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n)\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u3001ImageNette\u548cCIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCertMask\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4PatchCleanser\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a+13.4%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CertMask\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6e05\u6d01\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \\textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \\textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner.

Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAM-DAQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u5c06SAM2\u9002\u914d\u5230RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528SAM\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5230RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(PAMIE)\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u67e5\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u5e8f\u5185\u5b58(QTM)\u6a21\u5757\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5e27\u7ea7\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aRGB-D VSOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAM-DAQ\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "SAM-DAQ\u6210\u529f\u5c06SAM2\u9002\u914d\u5230RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphIF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u8f6e\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "GraphIF\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u6355\u83b7\u8f6e\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\uff09\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cbLLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGraphIF\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\uff0cGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHCC-3D\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c113D-VLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea698%\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D-VLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a3D token\uff0c\u5728LLM\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u6240\u67093D token\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u75593D token\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29(HCC-3D)\uff1a1)\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29(GSC)-\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u67e5\u8be2\u5c063D token\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952etoken\uff1b2)\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398(ADM)-\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u538b\u7f29\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHCC-3D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea698%\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u76843D-VLM\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "HCC-3D\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D-VLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5927\u7684hinter\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7531\u9ad8\u6548\u7684practitioner\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570token\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952etoken\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHint-Practice Reasoning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bhinter\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0cpractitioner\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DIR\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6811\u66f4\u65b0\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u89e3\u78011/5\u7684token\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u591a5.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FLOPs\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4eba\u5458\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u660e\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\uff09\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u7f16\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u5c0f\u4e8e8B\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5e94\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects.

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ffd\u89c6\u62a5\u544a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u62a5\u544a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u603b\u7ed3\u5370\u8c61\u3001\u7cbe\u70bc\u5173\u952e\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRadFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u5956\u52b1\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5370\u8c61\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u5c40\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u5f3a\u8c03\u5370\u8c61\u90e8\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3) \u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6216\u4e34\u5e8a\u654f\u611f\u75c5\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRadFlow\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RadFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u53c8\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u7cbe\u70bc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining \"contrastive reindexing\" for inter-class isolation and \"constrained cascade generation\" for intra-class protection.

(2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples.

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs.

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity.

Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LangGPS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLangGPS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u5206\u6570\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7cbe\u70bc\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c22\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLangGPS\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u3002\u9ad8\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6837\u672c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u8a00\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4f4e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoReal\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cLLM\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eVRP\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NCO\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1a\u5148\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "EvoReal\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728TSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f31.05%\u548c2.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoReal\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301ID\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u8861\u5316(DiVE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931(AVL)\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931(PVL)\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u62a4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDiVE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728ID\u3001OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728ID\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}.

Chaturvedi", "Gaurav Bagwe", "Lan Zhang", "Pan He", "Xiaoyong Yuan"], "title": "MOBA: A Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack against LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Systems", "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026 Conference", "summary": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u71b5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0eLLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eLLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728token\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles.

This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316NPC\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5b9a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u786c\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u7684\u660e\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5b9aNPC\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u4fdd\u5b58\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u52a0\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \\texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness.

By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence.

Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances.

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "LocalBench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u53bf\u7ea7\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b14,782\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d6526\u4e2a\u53bf\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec556.8%\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u4f4e\u4e8e15.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b8f\u89c2\u5730\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8d85\u672c\u5730\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u516c\u6c11\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u793e\u533a\u65b0\u95fb\u9700\u8981AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u533a\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6587\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLocalness\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efaLocalBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3001\u672c\u5730subreddit\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u533a\u57df\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7269\u7406\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f3013\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u5728\u95ed\u5377\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u53d9\u4e8b\u95ee\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u738756.8%\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u4f4e\u4e8e15.5%\u3002\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u4f7fGemini\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534713.6%\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4eGPT\u7cfb\u521711.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u548c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u672c\u5730\u793e\u533a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002"}}

However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \\textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\\textbf{+23.7\\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\\textbf{+19.3\\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL.

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points.

To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u8fbe\u523070-82%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u4e3a30-45%\uff1b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u524d30\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u540e\u9700\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u6216RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5177\u6709\u4ece\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u901a\u7528RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u800c\u975e\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u5e76\u6a21\u7cca\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u7c7b\u578b\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e0e\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CONLIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5c0f\u8bf4\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Welch's ANOVA\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u5e76\u6a21\u7cca\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u7a84\u4e14\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLF-MSC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u5355\u4e00\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6d41\u6216\u91cd\u4f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVLF-MSC\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ec5\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "VLF-MSC\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u6d41\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u6218\u7565\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6218\u7565\u5bf9\u624b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5171\u540c\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u81ea\u5229\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\uff09\u548c\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u6218\u7565\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlobalDiff\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u6b21\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bfc\u81f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u672b\u7aef\u6548\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlobalDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u951a\u70b9\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5206\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u534f\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGlobalDiff\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534746.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u6b21\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text.

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "GridPrune\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\"\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\"\u9009\u62e9\u4ec0\u4e48\"\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\"\u770b\u54ea\u91cc\"\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5197\u4f59token\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5148\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914dtoken\u9884\u7b97\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40Top-K\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-NeXT-7B\u4e0a\uff0cGridPrune\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752811.1%\u7684token\u5c31\u80fd\u4fdd\u630196.98%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u526a\u679d\u7387\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53472.34%\u3002", "conclusion": "GridPrune\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cdMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Final version to appear in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), 2026", "summary": "Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups.

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow.

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description.

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences.

The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information.

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff.

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential.

To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "H3Former\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684token-to-region\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5224\u522b\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH3Former\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757(SAAM)\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931(HHCL)\u3002SAAM\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efatoken\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1bHHCL\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6FGVC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86H3Former\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "H3Former\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "RUDDER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRUDDER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) CARD\u5411\u91cf\uff1a\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u6807\u51c6\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u4ece\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5411\u91cf\uff1b(2) \u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\uff1a\u6267\u884c\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728POPE\u548cCHAIR\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRUDDER\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RUDDER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions.

To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaViT\u5c06LLM\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4fee\u6539\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLaVA\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLLaVA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLaVA\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4fee\u6539\uff1a(1)\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u72ec\u7acb\u7684QKV\u6295\u5f71\uff1b(2)\u5728\u89c6\u89c9token\u4e0a\u542f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b(3)\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLLaViT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLLaVA\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaViT\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9LLM\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories.

By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

Code is available at https://github.com/lessiYin/DSANet", "summary": "Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations.

While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains.

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Anti-DreamBooth\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4eba\u5de5\u75d5\u8ff9\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u6270\u52a8\u975e\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5c31\u80fd\u79fb\u9664\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\u5982DreamBooth\u5b58\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAntiDB_Purify\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u51c0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6240\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u90fd\u5931\u53bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u865a\u5047\u5b89\u5168\u611f\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations.

Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GT++\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c3DFETUS\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece3D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u56e0\u80ce\u513f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u80ce\u513f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GT++\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u4ece3D\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\uff09\u548c3DFETUS\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57283D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee4.13\u6beb\u7c73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee7.93\u5ea6/\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u57283D\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5e73\u9762\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "GT++\u548c3DFETUS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u9762\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason.

In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\\% sensitivity, and 91.9\\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CT\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u6765\u7b5b\u67e52\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u80f0\u817a\u8868\u9762\u5206\u53f6\u6027(PSL)\u4e0eT2DM\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u80f0\u817a\u8868\u9762\u5206\u53f6\u6027\u5728T2DM\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728584\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u5272\u80f0\u817a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4bPSL\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bT2DM\u3002", "result": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005PSL\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8(4.26\u00b18.32 vs 3.19\u00b13.62)\uff0cPancAP\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8Dice\u5206\u65700.79\u00b10.17\uff0cT2DM\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f970.90 AUC\u300166.7%\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c91.9%\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PSL\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eT2DM\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u9884\u6d4bT2DM\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u75c5\u3002"}}

SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5373\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b2\uff09\u8868\u9762\u5316\u7684\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\uff1a\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u526a\u679d\u5668\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4e30\u5bcc\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u30022\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5bc6\u96c6\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u4ee4\u724c\u30023\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\uff1a\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSemanticVLA\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4OpenVLA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad821.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e3.0\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoTyle\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u7801\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5408\u6210\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1CoTyle\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\"\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u503c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\"\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u4e0e\u4f26\u6bd4\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoTyle\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniVGGT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u5916\u53c2\u7b49\uff09\u76843D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GeoAdapter\u548c\u968f\u673a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7acb\u4f53\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u8003\u8651RGB\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoAdapter\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eVGGT\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u76ee/\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7acb\u4f53\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cOmniVGGT\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528RGB\u8f93\u5165\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5230VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVGGT\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faM&M-3D\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u5408\u6210\uff08DBT\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fbFFDM\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "DBT\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f53\u79ef\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4e22\u5f03\u4f53\u79ef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "M&M-3D\u6784\u5efa\u6076\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u76843D\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u590d\u6df7\u54083D\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5b66\u4e603D\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4fee\u6539M&M\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eceFFDM\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6743\u91cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd42D\u6295\u5f71\u548c3D\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534711-54%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u53473-10%\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4\u590d\u67423D\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u534720-47%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u53472-10%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728BCS-DBT\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u53474%\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "M&M-3D\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DBT\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency.
