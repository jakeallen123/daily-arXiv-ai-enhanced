### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化将原始长视频转换为用于世界模型训练的多模态标注数据，通过AI模型预标注和结构化输出，显著提升标注效率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注大规模多模态数据集成本高、速度慢，阻碍了鲁棒世界模型的训练，需要自动化解决方案来提升效率。

Method: 使用GAZE流水线：(1)标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；(2)应用多种AI模型进行密集多模态预标注；(3)整合信号为结构化输出供人工验证。

Result: 节省约19分钟/小时人工审核时间，减少80%以上人工审核量，通过保守跳过低显著性片段实现效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法生成高质量、隐私感知的数据集，可直接用于学习跨模态动态和动作条件预测，为世界模型训练提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss，用于解决PET图像低剂量下的泊松噪声问题，提高图像保真度和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中高剂量增加辐射风险，低剂量产生泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理且导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net模型，引入新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss，结合物理数据提高图像保真度。

Result: 在PET数据集测试中，PC-UNet显著改善了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能有效整合物理信息，为低剂量PET成像提供鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一个轻量级的推理时方法，通过直接干预注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，无需优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体间语义相关特征的意外传递。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时加强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker也能有效缓解泄漏而不影响保真度或质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了注意力控制的价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，显著提升城市导航AI的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市仿真环境要么缺乏可扩展性，要么无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，无法满足城市AI代理的训练需求。

Method: 开发UrbanVerse系统，包括UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: 构建了来自24个国家的160个高质量场景，在仿真中提升成功率6.3%，在零样本仿真到真实迁移中提升30.1%，仅需两次干预即可完成300米真实世界任务。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse能够保留真实世界语义和布局，实现与人工制作场景相当的真实感，在城市导航中展现出强大的扩展能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略保持结构一致性，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、不一致，且难以保持未编辑区域，多视图渲染编辑后重建会引入伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提升了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

*Jiaxin Ge,Grace Luo,Heekyung Lee,Nishant Malpani,Long Lian,XuDong Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Trevor Darrell,Sewon Min,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体真实使用数据构建图像生成模型基准，发现现有基准未覆盖的新兴用例，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准滞后于模型发展，无法捕捉社交媒体上展示的新兴用例，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中收集数据，构建包含31,000多个提示的数据集，并基于社区反馈设计模型质量评估指标。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量指标设计提供信息。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实世界使用证据构建基准，能更好地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和新兴用例，为模型评估提供更全面的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模框架的方法，用于从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中筛选最相关和多样化的模型，解决用户在海量模型中选择困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能够个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上超过10万个适配器缺乏结构化组织，用户难以有效选择和利用最适合的模型。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出新颖的子模框架来解决该问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域中生成多样化的输出结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的子模框架有效解决了大规模LoRA适配器数据库中的模型选择问题，能够生成多样化且相关的内容。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在实例级感知任务中表现出色，但计算成本过高限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能在保持性能的同时实现高效边缘部署的架构。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；统一的训练策略简化训练流程。

Result: MOBIUS将像素和变换器解码器FLOPs分别减少55%和75%，仅需三分之一训练迭代次数即可保持最先进性能，在高低端设备上均建立高效分割新基准。

Conclusion: MOBIUS实现了帕累托最优的模型缩放，为从高端加速器到移动硬件的各种设备提供了高效的实例分割解决方案，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGS是一个数据高效的框架，通过将种子问题分解为感知和推理因子，然后系统性地重新组合生成大量合成问答对，从而为多模态大语言模型提供高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多模态大语言模型在多样化任务上表现良好，但在标注数据难以收集的领域推理能力有限，特别是图表、文档和网页等人工图像领域。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后系统性地与新的图像重新组合生成大量合成问答对，每个生成的问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理实验中，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练在多个数据集上实现了更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可以扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

### [10] [Generalized Dynamics Generation towards Scannable Physical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15041)
*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个统一框架，从势能角度整合刚体、铰接体和软体动力学，通过引入方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，使用神经网络建模材料属性，实现几何无关的物理模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界需要能够处理复杂物理行为的通用具身智能体，但现有方法难以统一处理不同物理系统的动力学。

Method: 从势能最小化原理出发，引入方向刚度概念扩展弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模材料属性，神经场表示变形，实现几何无关的统一物理模拟。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen通过势能视角成功统一了多种物理系统动力学，为复杂动态场景中的虚拟环境构建和机器人训练提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，解决了3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据可用性限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要缓解数据缺乏的问题。

Method: 通过注入额外的归纳偏置：引入报告生成目标，并将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练相结合，利用图像-文本配对数据集和纯图像数据集，开发了COLIPRI编码器家族。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过额外的归纳偏置和3D医学影像领域的最佳实践，成功开发了性能优越的COLIPRI编码器家族，有效解决了数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间传输推理知识来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免资源密集的监督微调或强化学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源，而简单的模型合并方法效果不稳定

Method: DRIFT方法在梯度空间中传输推理知识，预计算推理先验作为参数空间差异，在微调过程中偏置梯度方向

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT相比简单合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超越资源密集型方法

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且有效的多模态推理能力提升方法，在保持标准微调流程的同时实现高效的推理知识迁移

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

TL;DR: 婴儿日常视觉体验的统计特性（块状相似性结构）支持早期类别学习和泛化能力，这种结构在机器学习中也能提升小数据集上的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决婴儿如何从有限经验中学习并泛化基本水平物体类别的矛盾，探索日常视觉体验的统计特性在类别学习中的作用。

Method: 分析14名婴儿（7-11个月）的自我中心视角图像，发现其视觉输入具有块状相似性结构；通过计算实验在机器学习中模拟这种结构。

Result: 婴儿日常视觉体验显示八个早期学习类别中存在高度相似图像簇与更可变图像交替出现的模式；在机器学习中模拟这种结构能改善小数据集上的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然体验的块状结构可能支持早期类别学习和泛化，并为各种问题和学习者的高效学习提供原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个用于长期3D高斯泼溅重建的新框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元消除冗余，使用3D点Transformer解决跨帧几何和光度不一致性，能够在超过50个视图上以超过10FPS的速度进行在线重建，实现50%-90%的冗余去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长时视频序列中预测逐像素高斯并将所有视图的高斯组合作为场景表示，导致大量冗余和几何不一致。

Method: 使用3D重建骨干网络预测密集逐像素高斯和编码区域几何复杂度的显著性图；通过优先考虑高复杂度区域将冗余高斯压缩为紧凑锚点；使用3D点Transformer学习空间结构先验来精炼锚点属性和显著性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在新视图合成和深度估计方面达到最先进性能，展示了优越的效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，为长期可泛化3D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT是一个文本到视频生成框架，通过结合轨迹和局部文本描述来控制视频生成，解决了多对象场景下控制精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在复杂场景和多对象设置中控制能力有限，轨迹与视觉实体之间的对应关系不明确。

Method: 提出位置感知交叉注意力机制和双CFG方案，分别调制局部和全局文本指导，并开发了数据管道生成带轨迹和局部描述的标注数据。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐精度和运动可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹和文本的配对控制，显著提升了视频生成中对多对象外观和运动的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Conclusion: 扩散先验作为脑MRI分析的多功能工具具有巨大潜力，能够提高解剖保真度并改进现有深度学习方法的输出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了FFT-MIL框架，通过傅里叶变换在频域提取全局上下文信息，与空间patch特征融合，提升WSI分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉WSI的全局依赖关系，因为WSI尺寸巨大且patch嵌入具有局部性，这限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，通过FFT-Block（包含卷积层和Min-Max归一化）处理频域数据，然后将全局频域特征与空间patch特征融合

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了六种最先进的MIL方法，集成FFT-Block后平均提升macro F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效机制，能够补充空间特征，提升MIL在计算病理学中的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: XModBench是一个大规模三模态基准测试，专门用于评估全模态大语言模型的跨模态一致性，揭示现有模型在模态不变推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但无法确定全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏差。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的XModBench基准，涵盖五个任务系列，系统覆盖所有六种模态组合的问答对，进行细粒度诊断分析。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间和时间推理上表现不佳（准确率低于60%），存在持续的模态差异（音频表现显著差于文本），以及系统性的方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性更低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但针对图像-文本交错文档数据的高质量数据筛选研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成对应四个质量级别的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用于DataComp和OBELICS数据集的数据筛选。

Result: 使用UniFilter筛选数据预训练的MLLMs展现出显著增强的能力，包括更强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，在视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter方法有效提升了多模态预训练数据的质量，为下游任务带来显著性能提升，相关数据和模型已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性问题，通过在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估了不同超参数设置和数据增强策略对三个下游数据集的影响，并提出了提高可重复性的实用规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性挑战，这些挑战主要源于软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等问题。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、学习率）和数据增强策略，并在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon）上进行测试。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值在0.7-0.8时表现最佳，分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能，LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学中的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究提供了开发可重复数字病理学基础模型的实用指南。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中无关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，生成保留类别判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像。

Result: 在8个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出优越性能，在常规和长尾设置下分别比最先进的增强方法平均分类准确率提高0.73%和6.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成更好地保留类别判别特征并具有受控变化的图像，有效增强训练数据集的多样性，从而提高下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Conclusion: CARDIUM数据集和多模态transformer架构为先天性心脏病产前检测提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了AI模型的临床决策支持能力。

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset
and code to encourage further research on this unexplored field. Our dataset

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲分类框架，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系，在多个基准数据集上表现出竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战性问题，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义。

Method: 使用双曲几何表示标签为球体，通过球体交互自然捕捉层次结构（包含）、共现模式（重叠）和语义独立性（分离）等多种关系类型，引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化。

Result: 在MS-COCO、PASCAL VOC、NUS-WIDE、CUB-200-2011四个基准数据集上的广泛实验显示竞争性性能，统计分析与现实世界共现模式强相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，学习到的嵌入具有更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，它不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成。该方法通过冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义区分度的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细节，从而实现更高效的扩散训练和更好的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于VAE的潜在扩散模型存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差的问题，这主要源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。研究表明这些属性不仅对感知和理解任务至关重要，也对潜在扩散模型的稳定高效训练很关键。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义区分度的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节以实现高保真重建。扩散模型直接在这个语义结构化的潜在空间上进行训练，促进更高效的学习。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样，并提高了生成质量。实验结果表明SVG保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力，为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了原则性途径。

Conclusion: SVG通过利用自监督表示构建语义结构化的潜在空间，克服了传统VAE+扩散范式的局限性，为高效、高质量的视觉生成提供了新的解决方案，并展示了在更广泛视觉任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个用于大语言模型结构化剪枝的新框架，通过渐进式层剪枝、基于拼接的合并技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，有效减少模型大小同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型结构化剪枝方法存在三个主要限制：直接移除层导致性能显著下降、线性权重层聚合能力不足、缺乏有效的后训练恢复机制。

Method: 提出CoMe框架，包括：1）使用激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2）基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3）分层蒸馏协议利用原始模型与剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试上，CoMe实现了最先进的性能。当剪枝LLaMA-2-7b的30%参数时，剪枝模型保持了原始模型平均准确率的83%。

Conclusion: CoMe通过创新的渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏方法，有效解决了大语言模型结构化剪枝中的关键挑战，在显著减少模型大小的同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能单数据集训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器（APAE）进行自适应特征提取和原型学习，以及渐进式原型感知解码器（PPAD）生成提示引导注意力。还设计了原型感知损失（PA loss）解决多数据集训练中的原型专家寻址不稳定问题。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集联合训练，成功解决了面部关键点检测中的数据集差异问题，实现了统一且高性能的检测框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏评估6D空间推理能力的框架，需要开发综合评估方法。

Method: 创建包含4个关键能力的合成数据集，采用级联评估结构，包含7种问题类型和5个难度级别，并引入相对性能下降率(RPDR)指标。

Result: 评估显示模型性能随任务复杂度增加而下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中，并发现不同属性的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限，需要改进空间理解能力。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Motivation: 当前的人体运动重建方法在将人体准确放置在3D空间中存在困难，而逼真的角色与环境交互对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人等领域的自主代理至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点图。通过比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景提取的人体点图，迭代优化关键帧中的人体位置。在优化过程中保持非关键帧人体网格相对于关键帧根关节位置的一致性。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，SHARE在准确重建周围场景的同时实现了更精确的3D人体放置，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHARE方法能够同时在策划数据集和野外网络视频上实现准确的人体运动重建和3D定位。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，捕捉脑电信号在时域、空域和频域的集成依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集和一个临床MI ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法，可视化解释显示模型能有效捕捉神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能有效处理脑电信号的时空频依赖关系，在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，这给训练鲁棒的深度学习模型带来了挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段自适应微调：线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层；渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，以控制对手术领域的适应。该方法只需单次训练循环，无需多次迭代。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上验证，使用ImageNet预训练的ResNet-50和DenseNet-121，检测性能优于现有方法和传统微调技术，mAP达到96.4%。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是改进各种手术程序中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中可能具有更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Motivation: 当前多视图2D图像3D检测方法依赖深度预测来恢复空间信息，需要LiDAR点云监督，但预测深度质量不佳，存在物体边界深度不连续和小物体难以区分的问题，且忽视了跨视图一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 使用频率感知空间金字塔编码器(FSPE)结合高频边缘线索和低频语义构建特征金字塔；跨视图尺度不变深度预测器(CSDP)估计像素级深度分布；位置深度编码器(PDE)结合2D图像特征和3D位置嵌入生成3D深度感知特征；采用混合深度监督从度量和分布两方面进行互补学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效提升多视图2D图像3D检测性能，无需LiDAR监督，解决了深度预测质量问题和跨视图一致性问题。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 提出姿态感知融合策略，结合全局和局部配准，将多个辅助姿态的图像迭代融合到主姿态的3DGS表示中，并智能利用基础模型进行配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过多姿态融合有效解决了3DGS重建不完整的问题，为实际应用提供了更完整的物体重建方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线VAE-扩散框架扩展到实时设置，为需要连续响应角色控制的应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Result: 在43名受试者、4种扫描仪模型、5个中心的10,000+临床图像验证中：实现两倍于临床单次激发DWI的空间分辨率；单一模型泛化到7个不同解剖区域；在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声减少方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多激发DWI提供了可解释的稳健解决方案，其扫描仪无关性能在精准肿瘤学中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过学习任务特定特征而非攻击特定特征，来检测未知的越狱攻击，提高检测准确性和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化能力差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率

Method: 包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块用于安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块用于无监督攻击分类

Result: 在多种未知攻击上实现更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效检测未知越狱攻击，优于现有方法

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析3万起事故记录，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通安全分析中的两个基本挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化它们对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割提取11个可解释街道指标，结合道路类型上下文信息；训练XGBoost多类分类器，使用SHAP解释特征贡献；应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持针对性干预和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供可扩展的数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出了预测-校正（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务来加速学习，并基于此构建了PCMambaNet网络，在脑部MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch就能达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端深度学习虽然成功，但在数据稀缺领域（如医学影像）存在收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，限制了效率和适用性。

Method: PCMambaNet包含两个协同模块：预测先验模块（PPM）利用双侧对称性生成粗略近似，校正残差网络（CRN）学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战性区域和病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑部MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，且仅需1-5个epoch收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据优先强化学习(EARL)的自适应框架，通过动态选择关键帧并进行局部重采样来解决长视频推理中的信息稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中存在信息稀释问题，静态均匀帧采样会模糊关键证据，且现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度。

Method: 采用证据感知强化学习框架，让模型成为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源视频大语言模型的最新水平，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和所提框架的有效性对于长视频推理至关重要，模型同时学习了有效且高纯度的视觉证据选择策略。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模多模态依赖关系，并设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角学习和跨模态交互，有效提升了MAV动作识别的性能，为自主空中蜂群中的协同感知和控制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航空跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中来生成精确提示，解决了现有方法仅依赖空间定位监督导致的模糊提示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的夜间航空跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力，性能仍然较差。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中，作为明确封装目标细粒度属性线索的核心指导信号；最后基于通道类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核以精确定位目标特征位置，并通过空间门控实现鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的卓越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中生成精确提示，有效提升了夜间航空跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

Motivation: 解决微表情识别中标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽略了时间增强策略，无法充分利用运动特征。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上使用六种深度架构进行实验，在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均获得一致提升，结合空间增强时相对改进高达10%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Method: 利用多相机系统的固定空间关系增强相机姿态估计可靠性；使用平面模型去除道路表面三角化中的错误点；将多相机系统作为单一单元进行光束法平差以减少优化变量；通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现了0.124的绝对姿态误差，在真实车辆部署中验证了MRASfM在不同场景下的泛化能力和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架专门针对驾驶场景的多相机重建问题，在相机姿态估计可靠性、道路表面重建质量和重建效率方面都取得了显著改进，在公开数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature

COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉表示在模仿学习中通常保持冻结状态，导致任务无关性。本文探索如何利用预训练扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，而无需微调模型本身。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示来适应控制环境，以及视觉提示来捕捉细粒度的帧特定细节，通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 该方法在各种机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制所需的特定动态视觉信息，ORCA成功地将预训练扩散模型应用于机器人控制任务，证明了任务自适应视觉表示的有效性。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity
of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in
multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through
extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to
attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include
QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and

Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR
extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high
performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather
than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for
enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.

*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需属性标签的潜在特征对齐（LFA）算法，用于识别人脸识别模型中的偏见子群体，相比传统聚类方法能获得更语义一致的组别和可解释的潜在方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏见，传统偏见评估框架依赖昂贵且有限的预定义属性标签。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体的LFA算法，通过潜在特征对齐实现语义一致的分组和可解释方向发现。

Result: 在四种最先进的人脸识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现了与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者能够在无需预定义属性标注的情况下识别和解释偏见子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是新颖的平衡多任务注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需预训练模型的高性能架构设计，特别关注空间和光谱特征的平衡利用。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线模型、CBAM增强模型和平衡多任务注意力模型。后者结合坐标注意力（空间特征）和挤压激励块（光谱特征），通过可学习融合参数统一。使用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习融合参数自主收敛到约0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。

Conclusion: 系统化的架构设计在特定领域应用中具有高效性，性能接近微调ResNet-50（差距1.34%），且无需外部数据。证明了空间和光谱特征在卫星图像分类中的同等重要性。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET模拟图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中很有价值，但相比常规MRI更昂贵且不易获得。研究旨在开发一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，只需20个站点特定病例和基本人口统计信息即可部署。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，诊断确定性更高，评估者间一致性更好。

Conclusion: SiM2P使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，有望在资源有限环境中改善痴呆症的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下出现的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含场记板的生产元数据，提供全帧标注和裁剪单词图像，支持零样本和微调条件下的识别与检测模型评估。

Result: 尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调后性能显著提升，展示了该数据集在少样本学习场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: ClapperText为在低资源档案环境中推进鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化背景丰富的资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Conclusion: 提出的视觉引导3D布局生成系统能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，生成艺术性强且连贯的3D场景布局。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以应对姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影，需要更鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角检测边界不一致性，中观视角分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角捕捉眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴等表情区域的扭曲。额外加入面部朝向编码器进行姿态分类。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上实验证明，该方法比传统的单视角方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 多视角架构通过融合不同层次的面部特征分析，能够有效提升DeepFake检测的鲁棒性，特别是在复杂姿态和光照条件下。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是高效的模态转换工具，还能作为验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像分辨率和光谱分辨率不匹配的问题

Method: 方法一：传统上采样方法；方法二：ABSIS锐化方法，将高分辨率图像的整体特征与特定低分辨率图像的独特属性融合

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP方法的准确性，锐化方法使融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了49.46%和78.40%

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法特别是ABSIS锐化方法能有效提升时空图像融合的精度

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,

mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了运行速度，适用于实时纹理异常检测应用

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Motivation: 当前自监督去噪技术虽然效果显著，但在实际应用中受到计算和内存需求的严重限制，需要在推理速度和重建质量之间做出妥协。特别是在生物医学成像等缺乏干净训练数据的领域，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 基于Noise2Noise训练框架，提出了名为Noise2Detail的多阶段去噪流程。在推理过程中，该方法破坏噪声模式的空间相关性以产生中间平滑结构，然后直接从噪声输入中重新捕获精细细节。

Result: 广泛测试表明，Noise2Detail在性能上超越了现有的无数据集技术，同时仅需要一小部分计算资源。

Conclusion: 该模型结合了高效率、低计算成本和无需数据的优势，为生物医学成像提供了一种有价值的工具，克服了由于罕见和复杂成像模式导致的干净训练数据稀缺的挑战，同时实现了实际应用所需的快速推理。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

### [68] [Uncertainty-Aware Extreme Point Tracing for Weakly Supervised Ultrasound Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15666)
*Lei Shi,Gang Li,Junxing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督医学图像分割框架，仅需四个极值点标注，通过SAM2生成初始伪标签，结合增强的FGEPM算法和不确定性估计进行边界追踪，在超声图像数据集上达到与全监督方法相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高昂且耗时。为减轻标注负担，开发仅需极值点标注的弱监督方法。

Method: 使用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2提示生成伪标签；增强FGEPM算法结合蒙特卡洛dropout不确定性估计构建梯度不确定性代价图进行边界追踪；引入双分支不确定性感知尺度一致性损失和边界框对齐损失。

Result: 在BUSI和UNS两个公开超声数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能与全监督方法相当甚至更优，同时显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为医学图像分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉Transformer自编码器的无监督异常检测方法，用于脑肿瘤分割，无需人工标注即可定位肿瘤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤分割中标注数据有限、成本高且不一致的问题，提供可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Method: 使用多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，仅用健康脑部MRI训练，通过重建误差图检测肿瘤；采用多模态早期-晚期融合策略和SAM后处理优化肿瘤轮廓。

Result: 在BraTS-GoAT 2025数据集上，测试集病灶级Dice系数分别为0.437（全肿瘤）、0.316（肿瘤核心）和0.350（增强肿瘤），验证集异常检测率达89.4%。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有望成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医学AI系统在数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统破坏了统一诊断流程：图像理解模型无法生成视觉输出，图像生成模型无法提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: 在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专业模型相当，且双向知识共享提升了视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: 在单一医学框架中整合传统分离的能力，能够解锁跨多种医学视觉语言任务的改进，实现图像理解和生成任务的协同提升。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在档案影片分析中，由于噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等问题，传统相机运动分类模型性能下降的问题

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入方向网格运动编码，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入光流信息

Result: 在现代片段上将top-1准确率从81.78%提升至86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升至87.81%；在二战档案片段上准确率从83.43%提升至84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升至82.63%

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与transformer表示具有互补性，精心校准的小型运动头能显著增强退化影片分析的鲁棒性

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了指令式视频编辑的数据稀缺问题，建立的Ditto-1M数据集和Editto模型在该领域实现了新的技术突破。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理框架和从粗到细的策略解决内容感知布局生成问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏反馈式自校正机制，在复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加，需要更系统化的推理框架

Method: 采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块初步估计布局结果，精炼模块进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: SEGA方法通过分步演化范式显著提升了内容感知布局生成的质量和鲁棒性

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于识别和减轻文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型原有的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在面对隐含性暗示提示时容易生成不当内容，现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，难以检测这些隐含线索，而微调方法会损害生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法；提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制，通过抑制突出区域注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上的实验验证表明，NDM在性能上优于现有最先进方法，包括SLD、UCE和RECE等。

Conclusion: NDM框架能够有效检测和缓解隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型生成质量，为解决文本到图像生成中的伦理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

*Jort de Jong,Mike Holenderski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于超像素的正则化方法，用于在粗标注数据上训练语义分割模型，显著提升边界召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注（如粗略标注像素，边界区域不标注）成为可行方案。但粗标注下的分割任务，特别是优化类别边界对齐时，面临困难。

Method: 针对编码器-解码器架构，提出基于超像素的上采样正则化方法，鼓励解码图像中的分割像素形成SLIC超像素（基于像素颜色和位置，与分割标注无关）。应用于FCN-16全卷积网络架构。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比最先进模型，在粗标注训练下边界召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了粗标注条件下的语义分割性能，特别是在边界对齐方面表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Method: 结合每样本微钳制技术（温和限制极端值）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵引导模式，集成到CADE 2.5渲染管线中。

Result: 在SD/SDXL骨干网络上获得一致的质量改进，与CFG/Rescale有协同作用，能在低步数和高分辨率下产生更干净、更锐利的结果，且开销可忽略。

Conclusion: QSilk是一个无需训练的高效稳定层，能显著提升潜在扩散模型的渲染质量，特别是在低步数和高分辨率场景下。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Conclusion: 通过将概念基于视觉证据，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERNet：一种高效的前馈模型，用于处理非刚性变形的点云序列配准，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列，在噪声和部分输入下实现准确一致的配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云配准中的两个关键挑战：(i) 由于配准目标的非凸性导致的局部最小值问题，特别是在噪声或部分输入下；(ii) 长序列中的误差累积导致跟踪失败。

Method: 采用可扩展的数据驱动方法，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列：首先估计帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口方式下随时间细化其轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上超越先前最先进方法，相比先前最佳方法实现超过4倍的加速，提供显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，同时利用时间信息实现准确一致的序列配准，在精度和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多代理系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量，通过分解用户想法、选择最佳视频、专业代理批评和推理代理重写提示来实现持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性，需要一种能自主改进视频生成的系统。

Method: 使用多代理系统：1）将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划；2）通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频；3）三个专业代理分别评估视觉、音频和上下文保真度；4）推理代理综合反馈重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA持续提升视频质量和用户意图对齐度，相比最先进基线方法获得高达60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中更偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过迭代自我改进机制，能够有效且一致地提升文本到视频生成的质量，解决了现有方法在视频优化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

TL;DR: RelateSeg通过神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中引入一阶逻辑约束，同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，实现空间关系一致的像素级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，限制了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系并编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习，同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最先进的平均mIoU性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，能够显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新光照模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像学习生成先验，实现单张肖像图像的高质量重新光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法需要将输入图像显式分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。3DPR旨在通过生成先验解决这一欠约束问题。

Method: 首先将输入肖像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后使用基于triplane的反射率网络合成高质量OLAT图像，最后根据HDRI环境图组合生成物理准确的重新光照结果。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉镜面反射、自阴影、次表面散射等光照效果方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成头部模型的几何先验和光舞台数据的反射率先验，实现了高质量的肖像重新光照，且仅需相对较少的光舞台图像即可训练反射率模型。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一个无需训练、无需人工提示的舌象分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实场景下表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型依赖人工提示。为了在舌象分析中实现数据高效且鲁棒的分割，需要开发无需训练和人工干预的自动化方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过检索到的范例图像与查询图像之间的掩码约束对应关系，自动生成前景/背景点提示来指导SAM2模型进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，Memory-SAM在混合测试集上达到mIoU 0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)，在真实场景下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，为中医舌诊分析提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推动原生图像生成的前沿发展，探索将文本到图像生成和图像编辑统一在单一架构中的可能性，并验证关键设计洞察的有效性。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像令牌，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在多种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择对性能影响有限，强化学习能推动图像生成前沿，图像编辑仍是挑战但可通过后训练和数据引擎改善，数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 当前生物医学视觉语言模型的提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断的多方面特性，限制了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer
vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image
Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are
incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting
framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources.
Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned

results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

Motivation: 当前毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉现实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏评估，包括漏检和误报，削弱了现有检测器的可靠性。

Method: 从公共毒性数据集构建三个多标签基准，采用15类毒性分类法进行标注，提供理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督，开发基于伪标签的毒性检测方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著超越了包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek在内的先进基线，能够更准确可靠地评估LLM生成内容中的多标签毒性。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法有效解决了现有毒性检测的局限性，为LLM生成内容的毒性评估提供了更准确可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于AI在处理习语方面的潜在局限性，研究旨在评估生成式AI模型在评分包含习语和不包含习语的学生作文时的表现，结合语料库语言学和计算语言学的见解。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的作文列表：一个包含多个习语，另一个不包含习语。要求三个生成式AI模型（ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek）使用与人类评分者相同的评分标准对两个列表中的所有作文进行三次评分。

Result: 所有模型都表现出极好的一致性，但Gemini在与人评分者的评分者间信度方面优于其他模型。AI评估中未检测到任何人口统计群体的偏见。对于包含多个习语的作文，Gemini的评分模式最接近人类评分者。

Conclusion: 研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini由于其处理比喻语言的能力而成为最佳候选者，并显示出未来单独处理作文评分任务的前景。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

Conclusion: 该框架为修辞策略分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，揭示了政治辩论中修辞策略的演变趋势。

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常保持静态，持续学习的主要障碍是灾难性遗忘。研究者认为缓解遗忘的关键在于避免所有任务共享可训练参数，因此探索稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调方法，利用记忆层模型（Berges等人，2024）的稀疏更新特性。仅更新新知识相对于预训练数据使用高度激活的记忆槽，减少新知识与模型现有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在两个问答任务上评估学习和遗忘表现。稀疏记忆微调在学习新知识的同时表现出显著更少的遗忘：NaturalQuestions F1在全微调后下降89%，LoRA下降71%，而稀疏记忆微调仅下降11%，且保持相同水平的新知识获取能力。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

### [94] [Measuring the Effect of Disfluency in Multilingual Knowledge Probing Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15115)
*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MLAMA多语言基准测试中的模板翻译方法存在语法和语义问题，通过使用Google Translate和ChatGPT进行句子级翻译后，知识检索得分显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLAMA等基准测试使用的模板翻译方法忽略了命名实体的语法和语义信息，导致最终提示存在语法错误或措辞不当，特别是在形态丰富的语言中，这影响了得分的可解释性。

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较初始模板翻译与Google Translate和ChatGPT句子级翻译的知识检索得分，并对5种其他语系语言进行额外分析。

Result: 观察到知识检索得分显著增加，句子级翻译方法能更好地处理语法问题，提高结果的可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 建议在多语言数据集构建中控制语法正确性，使用神经机器翻译或LLM系统进行整句翻译是有效方法。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端框架，利用无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，自动从无标签语料库生成可解释的主题分类法，应用于2024年美国总统选举前的Meta政治广告分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中发挥关键作用，但分析其庞大且快速演变的内容仍面临重大挑战，需要可扩展且可解释的分析方法。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在支出和展示中占主导，而堕胎和选举诚信话题获得不成比例的关注度；资金模式高度极化，不同议题的道德框架存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对社交媒体政治信息进行可扩展、可解释的分析，帮助研究者、政策制定者和公众更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

Conclusion: 该方法在波斯语多选题生成方面表现出色，生成的数据集具有高质量，有望推动多选题研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习动态生成结构化表示来增强RAG系统的推理能力，在7B规模模型上达到与大模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的结构化知识表示来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成和调整结构格式以适应多步推理需求，并引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的质量。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模的Structure-R1模型性能与更大模型相当，证明了结构化表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度显著增强推理能力，为RAG系统提供了更优的知识表示方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT两种方法来解决大型音频-语言模型的短音频上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN是一种无需训练、仅修改音频token位置的上下文扩展方法，VLAT是一种训练策略，通过模拟不同音频长度来提升长音频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长形式音频理解能力。现有上下文扩展方法主要针对单模态LLM，在LALMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的上下文扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：训练策略，将Partial YaRN扩展为训练时的位置增强，在训练中模拟不同音频长度。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略提供了显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT方法有效解决了LALMs的长音频上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN作为无需训练的方法表现优异，VLAT进一步提升了模型对长音频的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动作文评分(AES)旨在提供高效准确的写作评估工具，本研究探索不同相似度度量和n-gram表示在作文评分中的有效性。

Method: 使用初中公民教育作文数据，通过n-gram模型提取特征并向量化，分别计算Jaccard系数和余弦相似度，通过RMSE评估系统性能。

Result: 余弦相似度优于Jaccard系数，一元文法相比二元和三元文法具有更低的均方根误差。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度结合一元文法特征能够提供更好的评分性能。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归语言模型（ARM）的混合架构，通过文本空间和潜在空间的协作，实现了更高的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长令牌序列，成本高昂。离散扩散语言模型支持并行生成且性能优异，研究两者混合架构能否获得互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间进行协作，一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行答案；然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在映射到ARM嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间的DDLM-ARM通信显著提升准确性，如DART-5从27.0%提升到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升到14.0%。混合架构在保持准确性的同时大幅节省计算资源。

Conclusion: DDLM规划器与ARM执行器的组合在潜在空间协作能提供显著计算节省且不影响准确性，为DDLM在混合架构中的推理应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，而原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面存在困难。需要一种能够处理文档多模态特性（文本、表格、图表、布局）的先进范式。

Method: 提出了多模态RAG的系统性综述，建立了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，回顾了涉及图结构和智能体框架的进展。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG能够实现跨所有模态的整体检索和推理，解锁全面的文档智能，但在效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

Motivation: 解决现有ICD自动编码方法面临的临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义鸿沟、罕见和长尾代码性能差以及可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识（UMLS、维基百科、LLMs），采用混合注意力机制建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上实现最先进性能，消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，满足临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了复杂性差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原则，将数据按难度分类，在训练早期优先处理简单样本，为处理复杂记录建立坚实基础

Result: 在英语和中文临床记录的多语言医学数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等临床任务中观察到显著改进

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的语义鸿沟问题，以及训练无关方法未能充分利用训练数据中宝贵推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP框架：预处理训练集问题，通过语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例，在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划，并引入智能前瞻机制提高效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的性能，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备上的大语言模型虽然可以通过本地数据获得上下文信息实现个性化生成，但逐令牌生成过程存在高延迟和硬件利用率低的问题，这限制了智能助手和UI代理等应用的发展。

Method: CoordGen框架包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度（动态平衡预填充和解码阶段的计算图）、上下文对齐草稿生成（通过轻量级在线校准提高推测效率）、硬件高效草稿扩展（重用和扩展中间序列以提高并行性并降低验证成本）。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验显示，与现有移动推理解决方案相比，CoordGen实现了最高3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。组件级分析进一步验证了每个优化的贡献。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的集成，有效解决了移动设备上大语言模型生成过程的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了生成速度和能效，为移动智能应用提供了高效的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古典诗歌生成和评估中的表现，因为目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 使用结合计算指标、LLM作为评判者和人类专家验证的三步评估框架，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度上的表现。

Result: 发现LLM在评估创意质量时表现出"回音室"效应，往往采用与人类判断不同的有缺陷标准。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为文学生成代理的能力存在潜力和局限性，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

*Hong Ting Tsang,Jiaxin Bai,Haoyu Huang,Qiao Xiao,Tianshi Zheng,Baixuan Xu,Shujie Liu,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoGraph-R1是首个使用强化学习直接优化知识图谱构建以提升任务性能的框架，通过将图谱生成建模为策略学习问题，实现构建与应用闭环。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图谱结构不优，影响检索增强生成系统的效果。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，设计两种任务感知的奖励函数：一种用于图谱作为知识载体，另一种用于图谱作为知识索引。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1显著提升了图谱RAG方法的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从构建"好"图谱到构建"有用"图谱的范式转变，证明了构建与应用闭环的可行性。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

*Catarina G Belem,Parker Glenn,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现传统可读性评估指标与人类感知存在不匹配，基于模型的指标在预测人类可读性判断方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动可读性评估领域存在可读性定义不一致和依赖表层文本特征的问题，需要更准确地理解人类对可读性的感知因素。

Method: 通过分析897个人类判断来研究影响可读性感知的因素，并在5个英语数据集上评估15个传统可读性指标与6个基于模型的指标。

Result: 研究发现信息内容和主题强烈影响文本可理解性；基于模型的指标在人类判断相关性排名中表现更好，而最佳传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 当前可读性指标与人类感知存在不匹配，基于模型的方法是更有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

*Heecheol Yun,Kwangmin Ki,Junghyun Lee,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFE是一个选择性集成LLM的框架，通过考虑分词不匹配和概率分布一致性来确定集成位置，在长文本生成中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成方法在短文本生成中有效，但在长文本生成中应用不足，且在每个token都集成会降低性能。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，选择性集成LLM，考虑分词不匹配和概率分布一致性因素，并引入概率锐化策略。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得提升。

Conclusion: SAFE通过选择性集成策略有效解决了长文本生成中的LLM集成问题，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LayoutRL强化学习框架和Infinity-Parser模型，通过组合奖励机制优化文档布局理解，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在跨文档类型泛化能力不足，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且高质量布局感知解析训练数据有限。

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过整合归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确性和阅读顺序保持的组合奖励来优化布局理解，并构建了Infinity-Doc-400K数据集。

Result: Infinity-Parser在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中始终达到最先进性能，显著优于专业文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型能够有效解决文档解析中的泛化问题，在多种文档类型、语言和结构复杂度下都表现出色。

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下表现不佳，特别是面对帕金森病等语音障碍时性能显著下降。研究发现音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈，需要改进识别和推理能力来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speech-LLMs评估多基于理想化输入，忽视了常见的不流畅语音，特别是与帕金森病等疾病相关的语音障碍。需要测试这些模型在与语音障碍用户交互时的表现。

Method: 引入VocalBench-DF框架，系统评估多维度分类的不流畅语音。评估了22个主流Speech-LLMs的性能表现。

Result: 评估显示Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下性能显著下降，表明其实际应用准备度有限。音素级处理和长上下文建模被识别为主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法来改进不流畅语音处理，构建真正包容的Speech-LLMs。加强组件和流程中的识别与推理能力可以显著提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

*Yanjie Gou,Jiangming Liu,Kouying Xue,Yi Hua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出用户游戏生命周期(UGL)方法解决游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，通过丰富用户行为数据和使用逆概率掩码策略，显著提升了游戏广告和游戏内物品推荐的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线游戏平台需要有效的广告和推荐系统，但现有推荐系统方法不适用于游戏场景，主要因为游戏稀疏性(仅数百款游戏)和游戏不平衡性(少数热门游戏主导用户行为)。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)来丰富用户行为，提出两种创新策略来提取用户短期和长期兴趣，并使用逆概率掩码策略解决游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告转化率(CVR)平均提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐离线AUC提升0.5%，在线ARPU提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示学习方法能有效解决游戏推荐中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升游戏广告和游戏内物品推荐的性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

*Lee Qi Zun,Mohamad Zulhilmi Bin Abdul Halim,Goh Man Fye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种专门化MedGemma模型的方法，用于生成高质量医学图像描述作为检索增强生成系统的查询，通过知识蒸馏创建合成数据集并使用QLoRA方法微调模型，显著提升了分类性能和描述准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成系统在处理基于图像的查询时效果有限，因为通用视觉语言模型生成的描述缺乏临床特异性和事实基础，需要专门化的医学视觉语言模型来提供可靠的图像描述。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏管道创建皮肤科、眼底和胸部放射学领域的合成数据集，使用参数高效的QLoRA方法微调MedGemma模型，并通过双重评估框架（分类准确性和RAGAS框架）严格评估性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在分类性能上取得显著提升，RAGAS评估确认在描述忠实度、相关性和正确性方面均有显著改善，验证了模型生成可靠、事实基础描述的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个强大的医学视觉语言模型专门化流程，验证了所得模型作为高质量查询生成器的有效性，为增强多模态检索增强生成系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GuessBench基准来评估多模态大语言模型在信息不完整情况下的主动推理能力，发现现有模型在主动推理方面表现远不如被动推理，存在显著改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评估主要关注被动推理，这与现实世界信息不完整的情况不符，需要研究模型能否主动获取缺失证据。

Method: 构建GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向图像，要求模型在信息不完整时从候选池中选择目标图像并迭代优化决策。

Result: 评估了20个优秀MLLM，发现主动推理性能远低于被动推理；细粒度感知和及时决策是主要挑战；感知增强对小模型有益，思维导向方法对所有模型都有提升。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理是重要研究方向，感知增强和思维导向方法为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于提示工程的可控摘要生成方法，通过多阶段提示框架实现不同抽象级别的摘要生成，实验表明提示长度、数据噪声和文本类型对摘要质量有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，探索如何通过提示工程提升大语言模型的摘要生成能力。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过短或过长的提示都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会导致ROUGE-L分数下降；模型在新闻文本上表现最佳，学术文章表现较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提升大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性，为改进摘要生成提供新思路。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

*Gucongcong Fan,Chaoyue Niu,Chengfei Lyu,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE是一个结合云端和本地LLM的协作框架，通过布局感知块分区、协同规划和协同决策，在保持任务准确性的同时减少移动代理的UI暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要信息；本地LLM容量有限，任务成功率低。需要结合两者优势，减少UI暴露同时保持任务准确性。

Method: 1) 基于XML层次结构的布局感知块分区；2) 本地和云端LLM协同识别子任务；3) 本地LLM排名相关UI块，云端LLM在顶级块内选择具体元素；4) 多轮累积机制缓解本地误判。

Result: 实验显示CORE减少UI暴露达55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效减轻不必要的隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE框架成功平衡了隐私保护和任务性能，为移动代理提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at
https://github.com/Entropy-Fighter/CORE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大语言模型在不同社会领域中欺骗行为的基准测试，涵盖5个领域150个场景，分析内在行为模式和外在因素影响，揭示模型在强化动态下欺骗行为加剧的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速提升，出现了可能在高风险部署中带来严重风险的欺骗行为，但现实场景中的欺骗特征研究不足，需要建立系统评估基准。

Method: 构建包含经济、医疗、教育、社交互动和娱乐5个领域的150个场景，超过1000个样本的基准测试，分析内在的利己主义或谄媚行为，以及外在的中性条件、奖励激励和强制压力等情境因素影响，并加入持续多轮交互循环。

Result: 在大语言模型和大推理模型上的广泛实验揭示了关键脆弱性，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为会加剧，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性情境线索的鲁棒抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏足够的防护机制，迫切需要开发先进的防护措施来应对不同的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available
at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间敏感领域（如法律、医疗、金融）的应用日益增多，需要具备跨时间维度的一致性，但目前缺乏对LLMs时间参考一致性的评估和改进方法。

Method: 引入时间参考一致性基准TEMP-ReCon，涵盖多种语言环境（英语、法语、罗马尼亚语）；提出基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型来提升LLMs的时间参考一致性。

Result: 实验表明LLMs确实存在时间参考一致性不足的问题；UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 填补了LLMs时间参考一致性评估的空白，提出的UnTRaP模型能有效提升LLMs在时间敏感任务中的表现。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

TL;DR: 提出一种动态字符分组方法，利用现有BPE分词结构，无需额外模型，通过添加显式补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩来控制补丁粒度，实现高效、灵活且语言无关的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示罕见词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型在Transformer架构中的性能瓶颈。

Method: 在BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，并引入二级BPE压缩阶段来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型依赖。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法在性能上匹配或优于基于动态熵和空格的补丁策略，同时保持紧凑的词汇表。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功结合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT提出了一种两阶段学习框架，通过在词汇概率空间进行潜在推理，实现了与显式推理相当的性能，同时显著减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显式推理方法计算开销大，而潜在推理方法性能显著下降。研究发现性能下降源于非结构化的潜在空间，难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段使用专门注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上达到新SOTA，匹配显式SFT性能同时减少推理链达4倍，在Math500和AIME24上基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效压缩率和有效全局并行度指标验证了这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

### [121] [MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543)
*Qiyu Wu,Shuyang Cui,Satoshi Hayakawa,Wei-Yao Wang,Hiromi Wakaki,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个模态组合感知框架，通过偏好损失和组合正则化目标来缓解统一编码器在对比学习中学习模态捷径的问题，提升跨模态检索在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管统一编码器在多模态大语言模型中具有灵活性，但传统对比学习训练容易导致模态捷径学习，在分布偏移下鲁棒性较差。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态对应物，并通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组成的原型对齐，显式建模组合表示与单模态对应物之间的结构关系。

Result: 在各种基准测试中显示出在分布外检索方面的提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是利用MLLMs作为统一编码器进行鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

*Sibo Xiao,Jinyuan Fu,Zhongle Xie,Lidan Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术解决传统推测解码中草稿模型和目标模型必须共享词汇表的问题，实现通用推测解码，获得1.57倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码要求草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表，这限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型，限制了该技术的实用性。

Method: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得新的目标标记序列，然后使用动态时间规整(DTW)建立映射来传递概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在多种任务上进行了全面实验，实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该方法支持不匹配的词汇表，可与任何现成模型配合使用而无需重新训练和修改，为草稿模型选择提供了通用方法，使推测解码成为更通用实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过偏差-方差分解重新定义跨语言差距，提出目标语言响应方差是造成跨语言差距的主要原因，并通过实验验证了该假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表征的差异，但本文提出目标语言响应方差才是主要因素，需要重新审视跨语言差距的成因。

Method: 采用偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，通过多种推理时干预措施控制响应方差，包括简单的提示指令来减少方差。

Result: 实验证明控制响应方差能显著减少跨语言差距，简单的提示指令使目标语言准确率提高了20-25%。

Conclusion: 目标语言响应方差是跨语言差距的主要来源，通过控制方差可以有效提升跨语言知识访问的性能。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

*Jinliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ParallaxRAG框架，通过多视图空间对称解耦查询和图三元组，实现鲁棒检索架构，在知识图谱增强生成中减少幻觉并提升多跳推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但容易出现幻觉且在多跳推理方面存在困难。现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法依赖扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: ParallaxRAG框架将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，构建鲁棒检索架构，明确强制头部多样性同时约束弱相关路径。利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，在统一的、可复现的设置下，该方法实现了有竞争力的检索和问答性能，同时减少了幻觉并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图头部专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个原则性方向，为构建更清洁的子图和引导LLMs进行基于基础的逐步推理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

TL;DR: 提出了KITE基准，专门用于评估韩语大语言模型的指令跟随能力，填补了现有评估主要关注英语模型的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的评估主要针对英语模型，忽略了韩语等语言的语言文化特性，缺乏专门的韩语开放指令跟随评估基准。

Method: 开发了KITE基准，包含通用和韩语特定的指令任务，结合自动指标和人工评估构建评估流程。

Result: 评估揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，深入分析了模型的优缺点。

Conclusion: 通过公开发布KITE数据集和代码，旨在促进文化和语言包容性的大语言模型研究，并激励对其他弱势语言的类似研究。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法如TK-PERT和最优传输(OT)在准确率上表现良好，但在处理大规模网络挖掘数据时，需要考虑速度和效率问题。

Method: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)来计算文档间相似度，相比最优传输方法更高效。

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax达到与OT相当的准确率，同时速度提升约100倍。

Conclusion: BiMax方法在保持准确性的同时显著提升了文档对齐的效率，所有对齐方法已作为EmbDA工具公开发布。

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指代消解研究中，完整标注的长文档数据集非常稀缺，特别是针对复杂文学作品的长指代链分析。

Method: 构建包含三本完整法语小说的标注语料库，开发模块化的指代消解流程，支持细粒度错误分析。

Result: 方法具有竞争力，能有效扩展到长文档，并能推断虚构人物的性别，对文学分析和下游NLP任务都有价值。

Conclusion: 该语料库和管道为长文档指代消解提供了重要资源，在文学分析和NLP应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender
of fictional characters, showcasing its relevance for both literary analysis
and downstream NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个诊断套件，用于评估语言模型在科学问题中提出多种合理解释的能力，而不仅仅是单一正确答案。它测量三个指标：有效性、独特性和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流程中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释集合的能力，因为许多科学问题存在不确定性，多个机制不同的假设可能与相同观察结果一致。

Method: HypoSpace将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，在三个结构化领域实例化：(i)扰动因果图，(ii)重力约束3D体素重建，(iii)布尔遗传相互作用。这些领域具有确定性验证器和精确枚举的假设空间。

Result: 研究发现，在指令调优和推理导向模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，这揭示了仅靠正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace提供了一个受控探针，用于评估那些明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法，而不是简单的排行榜工具。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Motivation: 解决仇恨言论检测中缺乏上下文信息的问题，利用LLMs生成相关背景知识来提升检测性能。

Method: 提出两种上下文生成策略（命名实体聚焦和全文提示）和四种整合方法（文本拼接、嵌入拼接、分层transformer融合、LLM驱动文本增强）。

Result: 在文本隐式仇恨言论数据集上获得3个F1分数提升，在多模态厌女表情包数据集上获得6个F1分数提升，嵌入拼接方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息和整合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，LLMs作为动态知识库能有效提升检测性能。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强推理模型计算成本高昂，因为检索和推理token都消耗大量资源。需要在不影响性能的前提下提高效率。

Method: 1) 基于查询和检索结果动态调整检索文档列表长度；2) 开发成本感知优势函数用于强化学习训练；3) 探索内存和延迟约束下的实现方案。

Result: 在7个公开QA数据集上评估，模型延迟降低16-20%，同时精确匹配准确率平均提高5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升检索增强推理模型的效率，同时保持甚至改善模型效果，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DLMs在效率和性能上已被广泛研究，但其内部工作机制仍不清楚。本文旨在探索DLMs的注意力模式，特别是注意力下沉现象的特性。

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点关注注意力下沉现象，并与ARMs进行对比研究。

Result: 发现DLMs存在动态的注意力下沉现象，下沉位置在生成过程中会移动；DLMs对注意力下沉的移除具有强鲁棒性，性能仅轻微下降，而ARMs对此高度敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DLMs与ARMs在注意力分配和利用方面的根本差异，为理解扩散语言模型的内部工作机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Motivation: 传统评估方法难以捕捉现代大语言模型的细微、主观和开放式特性，需要更有效的评估框架。

Method: 提出自动互评框架，让大语言模型通过自我博弈和同行评审相互评估输出，并使用博弈论投票算法聚合同行评审结果。

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合的工作，为LLM能力评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何在没有参考翻译的情况下验证AI动物语言翻译器的问题，避免与动物互动带来的安全、伦理和成本问题。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合NLP洗牌测试，通过比较翻译文本在正确顺序和随机排列下的连贯性来评估翻译质量。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估方法高度相关。

Conclusion: 交互在翻译学习早期阶段可能不是必需的，通过仅分析翻译输出就能有效评估翻译器质量。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过构建一个单层Transformer玩具模型，揭示了语言模型中真假陈述线性分离子空间的形成机制，发现这种分离源于事实陈述的共现模式，并观察到两阶段学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型存在真假陈述的线性分离子空间，但其形成机制尚不明确。

Method: 构建透明的单层Transformer玩具模型，在事实陈述共现的数据分布下进行端到端训练。

Result: 模型成功重现了真假分离子空间，并观察到两阶段学习：先快速记忆事实关联，后缓慢学习线性分离。

Conclusion: 该研究从机制层面展示了线性真值表征在语言模型中的形成过程和原因。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

TL;DR: Paper2Web是一个用于评估学术网页生成的基准数据集和多维评估框架，PWAgent是一个将科学论文转换为交互式多媒体学术主页的自主流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学术项目网站生成方法（如直接LLM生成、模板或HTML转换）难以产生具有布局感知和交互性的网站，且缺乏全面的评估套件。

Method: 提出Paper2Web基准数据集，包含基于规则的指标（连通性、完整性）和人类验证的LLM-as-a-Judge评估（交互性、美观性、信息性），以及PaperQuiz来衡量论文级知识保留。同时开发PWAgent自主流水线，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: 实验表明PWAgent在学术网页生成方面大幅优于端到端基线方法（如基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本），同时保持低成本，达到了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估框架，PWAgent证明了在生成高质量交互式学术网站方面的有效性。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决产品评论和社交媒体中非正式和领域特定语言导致情感极性检测不准确的问题。

Method: 使用VADER进行初始情感估计，通过DistilBERT的置信度分数和模糊逻辑进行两阶段调整，最后用模糊推理系统映射到0-1连续分数。

Result: 在四个领域数据集上评估，结果显示与用户评分对齐度提高，能更好识别情感极端值，减少误分类。

Conclusion: 证明了符号推理与神经模型结合在语言动态领域中实现可解释、细粒度情感分析的价值。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Motivation: 传统的槽位填充采用语音识别和自然语言理解的级联方法，而语音大语言模型提供了更统一、生成式和指令跟随的方式，具有零样本能力和对未见槽标签的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究为利用这些新兴模型提供了实证指导和见解，展示了在槽位填充任务中缩小与上界差距的有效方法。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放式高风险医疗对话任务中显著提升模型性能，在HealthBench-Hard基准上从7.0提升到27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学、代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现良好，但在开放式领域如医疗咨询中，由于奖励模糊、主观且依赖上下文，缺乏稳健的奖励函数，限制了RL的应用。

Method: 提出ORBIT框架，结合合成对话生成和动态量规创建，使用量规引导的反馈来驱动增量强化学习过程，无需外部医学知识或手动规则。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0提升到27.2，达到同规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习能够在复杂开放式任务中实现一致的性能提升，证明基于量规的反馈是推进LLM在复杂任务中发展的可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolySkill框架通过将技能的抽象目标与具体实现解耦，使智能体能够学习可泛化和组合的技能，在网页导航任务中显著提升技能重用率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能学习方法往往产生过度专门化于单个网站的技能，缺乏泛化能力。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够学习可重用和可泛化技能的框架。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，PolySkill将技能的抽象目标（实现什么）与具体实现（如何执行）解耦，使智能体能够识别和优化自身目标，学习跨网站通用的技能。

Result: 在Mind2Web数据集上，技能重用率提高1.7倍，成功率提升9.4%，在未见网站上成功率提升13.9%，同时减少20%以上的步骤。在自探索设置中，能提出更高质量的任务并学习跨网站通用技能。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤，为构建在自适应环境中持续学习的智能体提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Motivation: 在移动边缘设备（如地面车辆和无人机群）的联网系统中，传统联邦学习依赖中央服务器协调模型更新，存在计算负担和连接限制问题。分布式联邦学习虽然提供了可扩展性和鲁棒性，但仍面临日益先进的网络攻击威胁。

Method: 设计了复杂的针对性训练数据投毒和后门（木马）攻击，在车辆网络中表征新兴漏洞，分析DFL相比个体学习的抗攻击能力，并提出有效的防御机制。

Result: 研究发现DFL相比个体学习对攻击具有更强的韧性，同时提出的防御机制能进一步强化DFL对抗新兴网络威胁的能力。

Conclusion: 分布式联邦学习在车辆网络中虽然面临安全挑战，但通过适当的防御机制可以增强其对抗针对性攻击的能力，为基础设施受限环境下的机器学习决策提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles
and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of
data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote,
dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth
are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy
concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural
networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than
individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to
coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant
computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the
connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server,
distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node
failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite
these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy
cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data
poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging
vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience
against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective
defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber
threats.

Conclusion: 基于图神经网络的端到端优化框架为微服务智能路由提供了有效解决方案，在复杂拓扑环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper focuses on intelligent routing in microservice systems and
proposes an end-to-end optimization framework based on graph neural networks.
The goal is to improve routing decision efficiency and overall system
performance under complex topologies. The method models invocation
relationships among microservices as a graph. In this graph, service nodes and
communication links are treated as graph nodes and edges. Multi-dimensional
features such as node states, link latency, and call frequency are used as
input. A multi-layer graph neural network is employed to perform high-order
information aggregation and structural modeling. The model outputs a score for
each candidate service path. These scores are then used to guide dynamic
routing decisions. To improve the model's ability to assess path quality, an
edge-aware attention mechanism is introduced. This mechanism helps the model
capture instability and bottleneck risks in service communications more
accurately. The paper also conducts a systematic analysis of the model's
performance under different network depths, topology densities, and service
scales. It evaluates the effectiveness of the method in terms of routing
accuracy, prediction error, and system stability. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream strategies across
multiple key metrics. It handles highly dynamic and concurrent microservice
environments effectively and demonstrates strong performance, robustness, and
structural generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机普及和内容消费增长，互联网服务提供商要求内容提供商分担网络升级成本，需要研究内容提供商在公共投资和私人投资之间的最优策略选择。

Method: 采用四种交互模型：集中分配、合作博弈、非合作博弈和讨价还价博弈，通过数值结果分析不同激励结构对内容提供商效用的影响。

Result: 讨价还价博弈可能导致比非合作和集中模型更高的公共投资，但如果内容提供商被激励投资私人基础设施，这种效益会减少。

Conclusion: 内容提供商的投资决策受到交互模型类型的影响，讨价还价博弈在某些情况下能促进更高的公共投资，但私人投资激励会削弱这种效果。

Abstract: The ubiquity of smartphones has fueled content consumption worldwide, leading
to an ever-increasing demand for a better Internet experience. This has
necessitated an upgrade of the capacity of the access network. The Internet
service providers (ISPs) have been demanding that the content providers (CPs)
share the cost of upgrading access network infrastructure. A \emph{public
investment} in the infrastructure of a neutral ISP will boost the profit of the
CPs, and hence, seems a rational strategy. A CP can also make a \emph{private
investment} in its infrastructure and boost its profits. In this paper, we
study the trade-off between public and private investments by a CP when the
decision is made under different types of interaction between them.
Specifically, we consider four interaction models between CPs -- centralized
allocation, cooperative game, non-cooperative game, and a bargaining game --
and determine the public and private investment for each model. Via numerical
results, we evaluate the impact of different incentive structures on the
utility of the CPs. We see that the bargaining game can result in higher public
investment than the non-cooperative and centralized models. However, this
benefit gets reduced if the CPs are incentivized to invest in private
infrastructure.

Motivation: 云计算和AI工作负载对数据中心内外通信效率提出了前所未有的需求。数据中心内外流量共存以及往返时间差异使得拥塞管理和流量路由变得复杂，特别是数据中心内流量更快的拥塞响应会导致与数据中心间流量竞争时的速率不公平问题。

Result: 与Gemini等现有最先进方法相比，Uno显著改善了数据中心内外流量的完成时间。

Conclusion: Uno系统有效解决了数据中心内外流量共存带来的拥塞管理和速率公平性问题，为数据中心通信提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud computing and AI workloads are driving unprecedented demand for
efficient communication within and across datacenters. However, the coexistence
of intra- and inter-datacenter traffic within datacenters plus the disparity
between the RTTs of intra- and inter-datacenter networks complicates congestion
management and traffic routing. Particularly, faster congestion responses of
intra-datacenter traffic causes rate unfairness when competing with slower
inter-datacenter flows. Additionally, inter-datacenter messages suffer from
slow loss recovery and, thus, require reliability. Existing solutions overlook
these challenges and handle inter- and intra-datacenter congestion with
separate control loops or at different granularities. We propose Uno, a unified
system for both inter- and intra-DC environments that integrates a transport
protocol for rapid congestion reaction and fair rate control with a load
balancing scheme that combines erasure coding and adaptive routing. Our
findings show that Uno significantly improves the completion times of both
inter- and intra-DC flows compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Gemini.

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要在信息不完整的情况下进行不确定性推理，但现有评估大多关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型，要求模型综合背景信息并表达概率先验，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试显示，模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信，性能受不确定性诱导方式影响较小，采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化影响不大。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅观测充分性无法保证干预能力，需要理论突破来解决AGI发展的根本限制。

Method: 提出因果力学框架，包含局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则，通过假设空间变化和错误修正机制来提升系统能力。

Result: 建立了理论框架和诊断工具，使系统能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并进行修正。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要从观测学习转向错误中心的方法论，通过因果力学框架实现假设空间的动态扩展和错误修正。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含733,651个面部表情记录的大规模、长期工作场所情绪数据集，覆盖38名员工30.5个月的数据，包含7种情绪概率和32个扩展情绪指标，验证了数据质量并建立了情绪分类和预测的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中大规模、长期情绪识别数据集稀缺的问题，特别是在自然主义环境中收集的情感计算数据不足。

Method: 在真实办公环境中收集38名员工30.5个月的面部表情数据，使用深度学习进行面部表情识别，计算7种情绪概率和32个扩展情绪指标，并进行技术验证和基线模型实验。

Result: 数据集成功复制了已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提高192%，p<0.001；昼夜节律验证），员工流失预测AUC=1.0，情绪分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R²=0.84。

Conclusion: 这是目前公开可用的最大、最长期的工作场所情绪数据集，为情绪识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染、流失预测和情感感知系统设计等研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

### [151] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应使用非对称权重和持久性测试，而非传统的对称权重和快照评分，以更好衡量通用智能的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：(1)对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，与人类智能研究不符；(2)快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。作者认为通用智能应被理解为稳态属性集群。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：基于因果中心性的权重评分（采用CHC理论权重）和集群稳定性指数家族（测量配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正）。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了可测试的预测和黑盒协议。

Conclusion: AGI评估应关注能力的持久性和稳定性，而不仅仅是快照表现，这能更准确地反映通用智能的本质。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM智能体与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，构建动态协作的分析生态系统，用于产品生态系统分析和关系挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量、异构、复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱的静态特性限制了动态交互和分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM智能体从非结构化数据中自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动的探索性分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新的思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建为状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，解决无API环境下LLM智能体的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 构建状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，将功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态连接起来；设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和新颖性奖励。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂开放环境中，相比最先进方法，在探索效率和战略深度方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化历史经验和解耦战略规划与探索，有效提升了无API环境下智能体的决策效率和长期规划能力。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS是一个多模态智能体系统，受人类记忆认知启发，通过语义标签和图结构的多模态上下文记忆实现高效概念驱动检索，在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体系统主要存储文本信息，忽视了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆多模态特性的启发，作者希望构建一个与认知科学中人类记忆理念一致的多模态智能体系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储到记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。不同于使用向量数据库的传统方法，该系统将信息概念化为语义标签，并将标签与其上下文关联，存储在基于图结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现概念驱动的检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中，系统比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍；在MSC基准测试中，性能优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统通过语义标签和图结构的多模态上下文记忆，有效提升了多模态智能体的性能，证明了概念驱动检索在多模态记忆系统中的优势。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要原因是视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR系统提取结构化视觉先验，结合多个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到高置信度共识分数作为真实标签，训练轻量级评论模型并生成优化答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，其评论模型在保持高效的同时具备与先进LMM相当的能力，为多模态数据优化研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然能提高模型准确性，但会导致响应过长和过度思考问题，增加了推理延迟和计算消耗，特别是在简单任务中。

Method: 提出DEPO框架，包含三个核心组件：解耦优势算法指导减少低效token、难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度、优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的冗余推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架能有效减少大推理模型的低效推理，在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算开销和推理延迟。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡布线效率和面积效率方面达到工业标准，显著提升了模拟集成电路布局的质量。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过一种转换方法使任何可修正的目标都能在不牺牲性能的情况下变得可修正，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI训练过程中，部分学习的目标往往会激励AI避免进一步的目标更新，这阻碍了训练收敛、错误修正和人类偏好变化。可修正性作为关键安全属性，现有文献缺乏既具有可修正性又与不可修正替代品竞争的目标规范。

Method: 首先形式化定义可修正性，然后引入一种转换方法，通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测来构建任何可修正目标的修正版本。该方法可递归扩展到修正代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标可以被有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 提出的转换方法能够构建既具有可修正性又与不可修正替代品竞争的目标，为AI安全提供了重要工具。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 在战略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端强化学习是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds提供了一个可扩展、开源的领域自适应AI助手基础架构，结合了专业性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈的关键维度，现在可以通过该框架进行有效管理。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中候选查询选择的新框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制解决现有选择方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL任务中的查询选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，并且无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；构建加权共识锦标赛，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制重新定义了SQL候选选择，提供了更可靠和高效的查询选择解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

*Lavanya Umapathy,Patricia M Johnson,Tarun Dutt,Angela Tong,Madhur Nayan,Hersh Chandarana,Daniel K Sodickson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，整合患者历史就诊信息来改进疾病风险预测，特别适用于就诊频率不规律的情况。在28,342名前列腺癌患者数据上验证，显著降低了假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景信息对于评估患者健康状况变化至关重要，但现有方法在处理就诊频率不规律和历史信息有限时存在挑战。

Method: 模型首先基于最近就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险，然后使用从先前收集的影像和临床生物标志物中提取的信息来优化评估。

Result: 整合历史背景信息将假阳性转为真阴性，在预测临床显著前列腺癌风险时，假阳性率从51%降至24%；在预测5年内风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，可显著提高医学风险预测的特异性，为扩大低基线风险人群的纵向健康监测项目提供了可能。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型生成科学实验协议时存在的不完整和不一致问题，提高科学实验的可重复性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"Sketch-and-Fill"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，开发Thoth模型通过分阶段知识到行动过程进行训练。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源大语言模型，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行，所有数据、代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了解决RLHF中两个关键限制的方法：人类评估者偏好的多样性和成对反馈的局限性，通过引入排名反馈和异构偏好处理来改进模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性，这限制了模型对齐的效果。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好，而三个或更多响应的排名能确保可识别性；2) 开发DPO的EM变体来发现潜在标注者类型并训练LLM混合模型；3) 提出使用最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法来生成具有公平性能保证的单一生成策略。

Result: 建立了一个理论和算法框架，用于在生成模型对齐中实现多样用户的公平性和个性化，解决了现有方法在偏好多样性和反馈形式上的局限性。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成模型对齐中的公平性和个性化提供了理论基础和实用算法，通过排名反馈和异构偏好处理显著改进了模型对齐的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise
environments.

Motivation: 当前多模态方法在帕金森病评估中存在两个主要限制：训练时需要同步所有模态，推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习构建为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线提高了16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提高了4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展现出有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维问题（如司法框架、环境污染、疫情韧性等）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制，需要开发能够通过对话学习提升能力的框架。

Method: 提出Dialectica框架，让代理在定义主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两种模型架构（Qwen3:30b和o4-mini）上的实验显示，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo分数、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现针对性专业知识放大的可行路径，定性和定量证据一致支持这一结论。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Motivation: 现有并行语料库有限，且程序对齐数据由于长度较长可能无法提供足够的细粒度训练信号，而片段对齐数据虽然简短但能实现更细粒度的对齐学习

Method: 利用大语言模型自动生成片段对齐数据，并采用两阶段训练策略：先在程序对齐数据上训练，再在片段对齐数据上微调

Result: 在TransCoder-test上的实验表明，增强的片段对齐数据结合两阶段训练方法相比仅在程序对齐数据上微调的基线有持续改进，在pass@k指标上最大提升3.78%

Conclusion: 提出的数据增强方法和两阶段训练策略能有效提升代码翻译模型的性能，充分利用了两种类型并行数据的优势

Abstract: Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the
target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities
in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training
models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into
program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has
complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not
provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length,
while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due
to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods
for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In
this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to
generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we
explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently
enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data.
Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined
with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the

### [177] [Assessing Coherency and Consistency of Code Execution Reasoning by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15079)
*Changshu Liu,Yang Chen,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CES是一个评估LLMs程序执行模拟能力的任务，引入连贯性概念来检测推理是否遵循常识执行逻辑，并提出了衡量推理一致性的新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在编程任务中模拟程序执行的能力，排除因推理捷径、幻觉或数据泄露导致的虚假正确预测。

Method: 提出了CES任务，通过测量执行模拟中变量预测的正确性和连贯性，并引入强、弱、随机三个级别的推理一致性度量。

Result: 在HumanEval上，LLMs的81.42%执行模拟是连贯的，其中46.92%预测正确，53.08%预测错误。前沿LLMs如GPT-4和DeepSeek-R1的推理最不连贯。LLMs的推理一致性主要是随机(48.87%)或弱(45.37%)。

Conclusion: LLMs在bug相关任务中很少融入执行推理，其成功主要依赖模式匹配或自然语言捷径。CES可用于系统性地验证LLMs在这些任务中的可疑成功。

Abstract: This paper proposes CES, a task to evaluate the abilities of LLMs in
simulating program execution and using that reasoning in programming tasks.
Besides measuring the correctness of variable predictions during execution
simulation, CES introduces the notion of coherence to determine whether the
simulation complies with commonsense execution logic, even if the predicted
values along the simulations are incorrect. This enables CES to rule out
suspiciously correct output predictions due to reasoning shortcuts,
hallucinations, or potential data leakage. CES also introduces a novel metric
to measure reasoning consistency across tests with the same or different prime
path coverage in a spectrum: strong, weak, and random. Evaluating 16 LLMs
(including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution
simulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and
incorrect output predictions. Frontier LLMs such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 have
the most incoherent execution reasoning, mostly due to natural language
shortcuts. Despite relatively coherent execution simulation, LLMs' reasoning
performance across different tests is inconsistent, mostly random (48.87%) or
weak (45.37%), potentially explaining their weakness in programming tasks that
require path-sensitive program analysis to succeed. We also compare CES with
bug prediction/localization/repair, which intuitively requires control- and
data-flow awareness. We observe that LLMs barely incorporate execution
reasoning into their analysis for bug-related tasks, and their success is
primarily due to inherent abilities in pattern matching or natural language
shortcuts, if not data leakage. Without reasoning, there is a threat to the
generalizability of LLMs in dealing with unseen bugs or patterns in different
contexts. CES can be used to vet the suspicious success of LLMs in these tasks
systematically.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了开源软件项目中社区参与度对项目动态和寿命的影响，通过定义和验证社区参与度指标，发现社区参与与项目动态显著相关，且初始参与爆发对项目建立至关重要，持续高参与度则推动极端长寿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件项目依赖社区参与来维持长期发展，但社区参与对项目动态和寿命的可量化影响尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在定义开源软件中的社区参与，识别关键指标，并评估它们对项目动态和寿命的影响。

Method: 分析了33,946个GitHub仓库，定义并操作化了社区参与度指标（每月问题、评论、观察者、星标数），使用非参数检验和相关分析评估与项目动态和寿命的关系。

Result: 社区参与度指标与项目动态显著相关，在高度参与的项目中相关性更强。对于项目寿命，呈现复杂模式：每月参与率在年轻项目中最高，随年龄下降，但部分长寿项目保持异常高活跃度。初始参与爆发对项目建立至关重要，持续高参与度推动极端长寿。

Conclusion: 社区参与动态驱动开源软件项目的寿命和发展。研究建立了验证的社区参与度指标，并深入揭示了不同社区活动模式如何促进项目长寿。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) projects depend on community engagement (CE) for
longevity. However, CE's quantifiable impact on project dynamics and lifespan
is underexplored. Objectives: This study defines CE in OSS, identifies key
metrics, and evaluates their influence on project dynamics (releases, commits,
branches) and lifespan. Methods: We analyzed 33,946 GitHub repositories,
defining and operationalizing CE with validated per-month metrics (issues,
comments, watchers, stargazers). Non-parametric tests and correlations assessed
relationships with project dynamics and lifespan across quartiles. Results: CE
metrics significantly associate with project dynamics, with stronger
correlations in highly engaged projects. For lifespan, a complex pattern
emerged: per-month CE rates are highest in younger projects, declining with
age. Yet, a subset of long-lived projects maintains exceptionally high
activity. Initial CE bursts appear crucial for establishment, while sustained
high engagement drives extreme longevity. Active issue engagement's influence
intensifies with age, but passive attention's declines. Conclusion: CE
dynamically drives OSS project longevity and development. Our findings
establish validated CE metrics and offer deeper insights into how diverse
community activity patterns contribute to project longevity.

*Muslim Chochlov,Gul Aftab Ahmed,James Vincent Patten,Yuanhua Han,Guoxian Lu,David Gregg,Jim Buckley*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用大语言模型进行代码克隆检测，通过筛选76个LLM找到适合大规模克隆检测的候选模型，并探索了LLM集成方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码克隆存在知识产权侵权和安全漏洞风险，现有克隆检测方法在检测发散克隆时面临挑战，需要探索LLM在克隆检测中的最佳模型选择和集成效果。

Method: 筛选76个LLM模型，在BigCloneBench和商业大规模数据集上评估候选模型，分析模型特征对性能的影响，并探索多种集成方法（最大、求和、平均等）。

Result: 没有统一的'最佳LLM'，但CodeT5+110M、CuBERT和SPTCode表现最佳；在商业数据集上CodeT5+110M达到39.71%精确度，是CodeBERT的两倍；最佳集成方法达到46.91%精确度。

Conclusion: 较小的嵌入尺寸、较小的分词器词汇量和定制数据集有利于克隆检测；集成方法通过分数归一化和选择最大/求和等策略能显著提升性能，在大数据集上效果更明显。

Abstract: Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations
to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone
detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the
rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and
potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.
  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering
them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The
candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and
a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though
CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates
suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and
tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a
top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of
previously used CodeBERT.
  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the
selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results
suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods
like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling
approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the
best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over
individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.

*Lirong Yi,Gregory Gay,Philipp Leitner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM生成的代码在大多数情况下能提升性能，但人类开发者提出的补丁在性能优化上仍显著优于LLM修复方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能生成高性能代码，而不仅仅是功能性代码。

Method: 使用从开源Java程序中挖掘的65个真实任务，采用自动化流水线生成补丁，使用两种领先的LLM和四种提示变体。

Result: LLM生成的代码在大多数情况下性能优于基线，但人类开发者的补丁在统计上显著优于LLM修复方案。约三分之二的LLM解决方案与开发者优化思路语义相同或相似，其余三分之一提出更原创的想法，但这些原创想法很少带来实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM在代码性能优化方面有一定能力，但仍无法达到人类开发者的优化水平，特别是在寻找真正最优解决方案方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast
code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world
tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where
developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to
generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt
variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and
human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed
improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed
by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin,
indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We
further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the
developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they
propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these
original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FuzzSight是一个利用模糊测试和不变式分析来辅助代码审查的框架，通过检测程序行为变化来识别潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码审查主要依赖静态检查，难以发现程序的动态行为问题。模糊测试能产生丰富的运行时数据，但缺乏合适的分析机制来帮助审查者识别非崩溃性的行为变化。

Method: 使用模糊测试生成的非崩溃输入，提取程序运行时的可能不变式来表示程序行为，通过比较不同版本间的不变式变化来检测行为差异。

Result: FuzzSight能标记75%的回归缺陷和高达80%的漏洞，在识别有缺陷代码块方面比静态分析工具表现更好，检测率提高10倍且误报更少。

Conclusion: FuzzSight展示了将模糊测试和不变式分析结合用于早期代码审查的潜力，能够将静态检查与动态行为洞察相结合。

Abstract: Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and
vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work
under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the
dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such
behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is
typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise
code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but
unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze
program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible
to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.
  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify
potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at
runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties
consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals
of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended
changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.
  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from
non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program
versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code
blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of
regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing.
It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times
higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight
demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant
analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic
behavioral insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备广泛使用，但缺乏高质量公共数据集和数据收集条件控制，阻碍了稳健算法的发展。

Method: 使用智能手机作为中心枢纽，集成Polar H10胸带和Wear OS智能手表，通过自定义同步协议和用户友好界面收集同步数据。

Result: 系统能生成一致且同步的信号数据集，适用于人类活动识别和心率估计等应用。

Conclusion: Colepp工具有效解决了可穿戴设备数据收集的挑战，为算法开发提供了可靠的数据源。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness
trackers has fueled the demand for reliable physiological and movement data
collection tools. However, challenges such as limited access to large,
high-quality public datasets and a lack of control over data collection
conditions hinder the development of robust algorithms. This work presents
Colepp, an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to collect and synchronize
data from multiple wearable devices, including heart rate (via ECG and PPG) and
motion signals (accelerometer and gyroscope). The system integrates a
smartphone as a central hub, receiving data from a Polar H10 chest strap and a
Wear OS smartwatch, and exporting synchronized datasets in CSV format. Through
a custom synchronization protocol and user-friendly interface, Colepp
facilitates the generation of customizable, real-world datasets suitable for
applications such as human activity recognition and heart rate estimation. A
use case shows the effectiveness of the tool in producing consistent and
synchronized signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成代码时经常出现幻觉、逻辑不一致和语法错误等问题，在金融建模和科学计算等高风险领域尤为危险，需要提高生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 建立结构化研究框架，将TDD实践与LLM驱动生成集成，采用"测试优先"方法，提供技术约束和认知支架，适用于电子表格公式生成、Python脚本和Rust等强类型语言。

Result: 提出了明确的实验设计，包括参与者分组、评估指标和基于TDD的提示示例，旨在通过测试驱动思维提高计算思维、提示工程技能和用户参与度。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在建立负责任和可靠的LLM集成，特别帮助缺乏正式编程培训的电子表格用户，邀请合作来完善和实证评估该方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for
generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their
impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical
issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic
errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial
modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are
paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that
integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the
correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We
hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints
and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate,
verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across
diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting
languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an
explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant
groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By
emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking,
prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting
spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious
consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and
empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible
and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development
practices.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了React项目中性别多样性对软件开发的影响，发现女性在功能增强和依赖管理方面贡献显著，性别排斥对软件质量有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件设计中，女性参与往往只是象征性的，很少关注性别多样性如何从根本上改变开发模式。研究旨在理解性别包容对软件开发模式的潜在影响。

Method: 研究分析了React这个广泛使用的JavaScript库，在11年项目历史中考察了性别差异对稳健性和创新指标的影响，以及主要版本发布前的贡献模式变化。

Result: 结果显示女性在功能增强和依赖管理方面贡献显著更多，排除女性对软件质量有害。

Conclusion: 通过探索性别如何影响React开发中的创新和稳健性，研究为增加性别多样性如何带来更具包容性、创新性和稳健性的软件提供了关键见解。

Abstract: In open-source software design, the inclusion of women is often highlighted
simply to remind programmers that women exist. Yet, little attention is given
to how greater gender diversity, specifically women's participation, could
fundamentally alter development patterns. To understand the potential impact of
gender inclusion, this study investigates React, a widely used JavaScript
library for building user interfaces with an active contributor community. I
examine gender differences in metrics of robustness and innovation, as well as
shifts in contribution patterns leading up to major version releases over 11
years of the React project. My results show that the exclusion of women is
detrimental to software as women contribute significantly more to feature
enhancement and dependency management. By exploring how gender influences
innovation and robustness in the development of React, the study offers
critical insights into how increasing gender diversity could lead to more
inclusive, innovative, and robust software.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MirrorFuzz是一个自动化的API模糊测试解决方案，用于发现深度学习框架中的共享bug。它通过收集历史bug数据、匹配相似API以及使用LLM生成测试代码，在四个流行DL框架中发现了315个bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习框架中的bug会级联影响上层应用，但目前缺乏对跨框架API模式及其潜在风险的研究。许多DL框架暴露相似的API，使其容易受到共享bug的影响。

Method: MirrorFuzz分三个阶段：1) 收集每个API的历史bug数据识别潜在buggy API；2) 在框架内和跨框架匹配相似API；3) 使用LLM基于相似API的历史bug数据合成测试代码来触发类似bug。

Result: 在TensorFlow、PyTorch、OneFlow和Jittor四个框架上的评估显示，MirrorFuzz相比最先进方法在TensorFlow和PyTorch上分别提高了39.92%和98.20%的代码覆盖率。发现了315个bug，其中262个是新发现的，80个已修复，52个获得CNVD ID。

Conclusion: MirrorFuzz通过利用跨框架API相似性和历史bug数据，有效发现了深度学习框架中的共享bug，证明了其在提高代码覆盖率和bug检测能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) frameworks serve as the backbone for a wide range of
artificial intelligence applications. However, bugs within DL frameworks can
cascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing
reliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to
detect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across
frameworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many
DL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and
functionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one
API may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this
challenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover
shared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First,
MirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to
identify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a
specific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.
Third, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API
under test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger
analogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four
popular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor). Extensive
evaluation demonstrates that MirrorFuzz improves code coverage by 39.92\% and
98.20\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on TensorFlow and PyTorch,
respectively. Moreover, MirrorFuzz discovers 315 bugs, 262 of which are newly
found, and 80 bugs are fixed, with 52 of these bugs assigned CNVD IDs.

Conclusion: EASELAN框架为生物信号收集、标注和处理研究提供了有效工具，代码和标注数据库已公开，促进了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning and adaptive cognitive systems are
driving a growing demand for large and richly annotated multimodal data. A
prominent example of this trend are fusion models, which increasingly
incorporate multiple biosignals in addition to traditional audiovisual
channels. This paper introduces the EASELAN annotation framework to improve
annotation workflows designed to address the resulting rising complexity of
multimodal and biosignals datasets. It builds on the robust ELAN tool by adding
new components tailored to support all stages of the annotation pipeline: From
streamlining the preparation of annotation files to setting up additional
channels, integrated version control with GitHub, and simplified
post-processing. EASELAN delivers a seamless workflow designed to integrate
biosignals and facilitate rich annotations to be readily exported for further
analyses and machine learning-supported model training. The EASELAN framework
is successfully applied to a high-dimensional biosignals collection initiative
on human everyday activities (here, table setting) for cognitive robots within
the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1320 Everyday Activity Science and
Engineering (EASE). In this paper we discuss the opportunities, limitations,
and lessons learned when using EASELAN for this initiative. To foster research
on biosignal collection, annotation, and processing, the code of EASELAN is
publicly available(https://github.com/cognitive-systems-lab/easelan), along
with the EASELAN-supported fully annotated Table Setting Database.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件维护者缺乏对其库在实际项目中如何使用的持续反馈，这些洞察可以帮助他们改进测试策略、理解变更影响并更有效地指导库的演化。

Method: 对10个流行Java库及其各自50个依赖项目进行实证研究，分析API使用情况和测试覆盖率，并调查开源从业者评估这些洞察的实用价值。

Result: 库开发者提供的API方法平均只有16%被依赖生态系统实际使用，且只有74%的被使用API方法在库测试套件中得到部分或完全覆盖。

Conclusion: 社区分析可以为开源库维护者提供有价值的洞察，帮助他们基于实际使用情况优化测试策略和指导库的演化决策。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) is a pillar of modern software development. Its
success depends on the dedication of maintainers who work constantly to keep
their libraries stable, adapt to changing needs, and support a growing
community. Yet, they receive little to no continuous feedback on how the
projects that rely on their libraries actually use their APIs. We believe that
gaining these insights can help maintainers make better decisions, such as
refining testing strategies, understanding the impact of changes, and guiding
the evolution of their libraries more effectively. We propose the use of
community-based analytics to analyze how an OSS library is used across its
dependent ecosystem. We conduct an empirical study of 10 popular Java libraries
and each with their respective dependent ecosystem of 50 projects. Our results
reveal that while library developers offer a wide range of API methods, only
16% on average are actively used by their dependent ecosystem. Moreover, only
74% of the used API methods are partially or fully covered by their library
test suite. We propose two metrics to help developers evaluate their test suite
according to the APIs used by their community, and we conduct a survey on
open-source practitioners to assess the practical value of these insights in
guiding maintenance decisions.
