### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在水下目标检测中的有效性，开发了T-YOLOv5及其增强版T-YOLOv5+CBAM，在复杂海洋环境中显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下，提升检测模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能对比；第二阶段开发T-YOLOv5+CBAM，通过添加卷积块注意力模块来增强模型性能。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂目标检测中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提升了检测可靠性，T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步改善性能，但在简单场景中会出现精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后选择生成的图像，从而显著提高生成图像的视觉质量并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大型未整理数据集上训练以实现多样化生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。事后选择生成图像的方法会丢弃信息数据，损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是进行事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。

Conclusion: 通过在训练过程中直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法能够更好地对齐用户偏好，同时保持多样性和语义保真度，是一种更高效的文本到图像生成方法。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了针对自行车安全的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发并评估针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后，平均交并比(mIoU)达到63.6%，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据训练流匹配和扩散模型，有效恢复图像质量并减少2-4倍采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和串行数据采集缓慢的问题，提高实验通量并减少针尖调节频率。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练流匹配和扩散模型，实现图像修复和超分辨率重建。

Result: 模型能有效恢复图像，CLIP最大均值差异和结构相似性指标显示优异性能，稀疏采样数据重建可减少2-4倍采集时间。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验通量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的无反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、计算独立子流并自适应聚合，解决了传统流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在反转过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示。虽然已有方法尝试通过ODE直接映射源和目标分布，但编辑质量仍不理想。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：1）语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词；2）为每个子提示词计算独立流；3）设计投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在零样本编辑方法中在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，能够在保持多样性的同时确保编辑结果与目标提示的一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互Transformer从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，在有限数据下实现高质量重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的方法在从fMRI重建视觉图像时缺乏对实际所见图像的真实还原，需要更有效的方法

Method: 使用脑交互Transformer(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来指导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上超越现有SOTA方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据即可达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能簇交互机制，实现了从fMRI脑记录中忠实重建视觉图像，在数据效率方面表现突出

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺条件下开发实时肿瘤跟踪方法，最终采用基于SAM 2.1基础模型的方案，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在胸腹部cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束下，为MRI引导的放射治疗提供准确跟踪方案。

Method: 探索了两种策略：无监督配准和基于基础模型的分割。最终选择SAM 2.1 b+模型，使用第一标注切片的掩码提示，在TrackRAD2025小标注子集上微调，采用平衡的Dice+IoU损失函数和低学习率训练。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第6位，满足1秒运行时间约束。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放射治疗中具有实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪的强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在低光图像增强中存在信息不一致和空间局部性不足的问题，需要更有效的特征空间探索机制来捕捉精细细节。

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制，通过增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来改进特征空间探索，同时保持处理长程依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉质量，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的技术水平，还为基于Mamba技术的更广泛应用领域提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，为评估视觉语言模型在检测和理解异常方面的能力提供全面框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉中的异常检测局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: CAVE基准提供细粒度标注，包括视觉定位和基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性对异常进行分类，这些标注灵感来自认知科学研究。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为现实且认知基础的基准，为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN模型，用于预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水，相比现有方法将洪水深度图的平均绝对误差降低了近20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模拟器计算成本高，不适用于城市尺度的沿海规划。深度学习技术虽然前景广阔，但面临数据稀缺和高维输出等挑战。

Method: 利用基于视觉的低资源深度学习框架，开发了轻量级卷积神经网络模型，能够预测不同海平面上升和海岸线适应情景下的洪水情况。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为沿海洪水管理的可扩展实用工具，帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略以应对气候变化影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以理解动作序列和时序进展。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制在将视觉token传递给LLM之前更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中，时序推理能力显著提升，视频问答任务表现优于现有模型，最高提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解中的关键空白。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FlexICL框架，用于超声图像中骨骼区域的自动分割，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医疗场景。该方法仅需5%的训练图像就能在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现鲁棒的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用上下文学习(ICL)方法，在视频内分割设置中，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧。系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描上，比最先进的视觉ICL模型和传统分割模型在Dice系数上提升1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL作为超声图像分割的高效可扩展解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医疗成像用例。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的中间结果动态调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估表明，该方法在负引导强度和文本图像对齐之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法通过视觉语言模型的自适应能力，显著提升了扩散模型中负提示的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [14] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，仅通过修改输入图像（不改变提示词）就能操纵多模态扩散模型生成不当内容，揭示了现有模型在文本-图像对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态对齐方面存在不足，这种不对齐可能导致生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，需要研究其对抗脆弱性。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)方法，通过仅修改输入图像（保持提示词不变）来操纵模型输出，区别于以往主要生成对抗提示词的方法。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，特别是在固定提示词的图像编辑应用中构成了新的威胁。

Conclusion: PReMA揭示了多模态扩散模型在对抗攻击下的新脆弱性，强调了改进文本-图像对齐机制的重要性，特别是在图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods

Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal

PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准来评估Video-LLMs在多视角视频中的时间理解一致性，发现现有模型存在跨视角一致性问题，并提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Video-LLMs在不同视角视频中是否能保持时间理解的一致性，现有模型在跨视角一致性方面存在明显不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他者视角视频对，评估时间验证和时间定位任务。提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强视角特定的时间推理和跨视角一致性。

Result: 现有Video-LLMs在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，比单视角性能差很多。View-GRPO方法在改善跨视角一致性方面优于简单的SFT和GRPO。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是Video-LLMs的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在多个视角下的时间理解一致性。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了OracleAgent，首个用于甲骨文结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，集成多种甲骨文分析工具和多模态知识库，显著提升甲骨文研究效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下，学者需要花费大量时间搜索和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解释文本的多模态知识库，开发OracleAgent智能体系统，集成多种甲骨文分析工具并利用大语言模型灵活编排这些组件。

Result: OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越主流多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o），能有效协助领域专家，显著降低甲骨文研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实际部署的重要一步，为甲骨文研究提供了有效的技术支持。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出联合优化3D高斯点和相机位姿的统一框架，无需预标定输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和位姿精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机位姿估计工具如COLMAP，存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定位姿下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，使用定制化3D光流算法结合几何和光度约束优化相机位姿

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并总体上超越基于COLMAP的基准方法

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架有效解决了传统方法在大视角变化和稀疏特征分布场景中的投影误差问题

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见但关键的长尾场景中的表现，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 创建了包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门针对发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景，并提出了基于评分者偏好的RFS评估指标。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集包含了高级路由信息、自车状态和8个周围摄像头的360度视角，为端到端驾驶研究提供了专门的长尾场景测试平台。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的真实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM中的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型在多个领域取得了显著进展，但将梯度注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于SLAM等视觉任务特别有益，因为富含空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比基线方法，该方法性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过将梯度注意力信息集成到CNN表示中，可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，特别是在复杂环境下的帧关联效果。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集令牌方法缺乏几何细节，而显式体素方法共享全局体素网格导致小部件质量下降。需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 1. 使用隐式框向量集扩散过程生成边界框布局；2. 每个部件在固定全分辨率体素网格中独立生成；3. 引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题；4. 构建PartVerse-XL数据集（40K对象，320K部件）。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的细节不足和分辨率限制问题，为3D部件生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任意尺度视频超分辨率面临空间细节重建、时间一致性和计算复杂度的挑战，需要开发一个能够适应不同缩放因子和应用场景的强基线模型。

Method: 1) 基于图像拉普拉斯金字塔的自适应多尺度频率先验；2) 流引导传播单元聚合相邻帧的时空信息；3) 二阶运动补偿单元实现更准确的空间对齐；4) 超上采样单元生成尺度感知且内容无关的上采样核。提供了三种传播变体以适应不同应用需求。

Conclusion: BasicAVSR不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多种框架以适应多样化场景，为视频超分辨率领域提供了强有力的基线模型。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据点偏向某些概念的数据集偏差问题，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用在视觉基础模型表示上训练的稀疏自编码器来发现和量化人类可解释的概念，根据语义相关性和统计相关性将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕捉广泛的视觉概念，产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠地检测已知偏见并发现未标注的偏见。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动识别数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究过度依赖学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重不足。

Method: 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖6种常见文档类型；提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型（0.5B参数），采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，2）将知识迁移到特定领域进行细粒度标注。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成中的数据稀缺和复杂布局生成问题，为文档布局生成研究提供了重要资源和方法。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，测试视觉语言模型判断视频时间方向的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远逊于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用心理物理学验证的刺激物和行为基线，评估VLMs判断视频播放方向的能力。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作上的表现接近随机水平，远低于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有生成式融合方法生成能力有限，且模态信息选择缺乏可解释性，影响了复杂场景下融合结果的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 设计多尺度掩码调控变分瓶颈编码器进行后验概率建模和信息分解，结合扩散模型的概率生成能力与时变物理引导机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升了语义分割指标。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: 研究不同复杂度的CNN架构在远距离虹膜识别任务中的互补性，探索如何通过融合不同网络来提升识别性能。

Method: 在VGGFace2数据集上训练三种CNN架构（SqueezeNet、MobileNetv2、ResNet50），使用余弦和chi2度量分析性能，比较不同网络初始化，通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并使用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度比较网络注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合提供了显著增益，特别是当组合所有三个网络时。热图显示不同网络通常关注图像的不同区域，这解释了它们的互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上显著优于先前工作，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 不同复杂度的CNN在虹膜识别中具有互补性，通过适当的融合策略可以显著提升识别性能，为远距离生物识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束，确保生成轨迹符合安全和运动学规则，并将驾驶激进程度参数化为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束融入问题，能够生成多样且安全的轨迹，并精确控制驾驶风格。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络在眼周生物识别中的效果，使用从VGGFace2数据库提取的190万张眼部图像进行训练，在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，这是该数据集上目前报告的最低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分度和最小采集约束的优势，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集（仅几千张图像），本文旨在使用大规模数据集评估CNN架构在眼周识别中的有效性。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在从VGGFace2数据库提取的1,907,572张眼部图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在不受控的VGGFace2条件下，眼部图像的等错误率为9-15%，显著高于全脸图像的3-6%；而在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，这是该数据集上目前报告的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 大规模训练数据显著提升了眼周识别的性能，图像质量和采集协议的一致性对识别准确率有重要影响，在高质量数据集上可以达到接近实用的性能水平。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Method: 开发了包含3,907个卫星资源和16,410个场景的AEOS-Bench基准套件，并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，采用约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench是首个面向现实星座调度的大规模基准套件，AEOS-Former为敏捷地球观测卫星星座调度提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉-语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，同时优化文本可读性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真指标（PSNR/SSIM）或感知质量指标，但对字符级错误不敏感。场景文本（如标志、产品标签）包含最关键的信息，但现有方法往往将其视为普通纹理处理，导致OCR识别失败。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合ControlNet（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，采用乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心引导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率时，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1提高了最高15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG信号的模糊性，实现高保真度的图像重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中具有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: 基于真实视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示语，建立多维度评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和关注叙事流程、情感响应等抽象属性的人类期望实现度(HERD)指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估显示，现有方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征间的分散性，导致校准性能不佳，影响模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。现有方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散性或强制正交约束，但可能无法实现最佳的角度分离。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离，鼓励可学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性，从而增强角度多样性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性。在自然分布偏移下表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，通过3D基础对应关系实现竞争性的点跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到动态点跟踪任务。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据微调MASt3R模型，仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果，在TAP-Vid-DAVIS上与CoTracker2竞争，在EgoPoints和RGB-S上显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 3D重建模型可以成功适配于点跟踪任务，在动态和静态点对应混合训练下实现优异的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐机制，解决了少样本异常检测中图像描述与补丁级视觉异常语义不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能预定义图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致语义不对齐和次优的定位性能。

Method: 提出了多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建管道，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件，分别负责引入细粒度语义和促进视觉区域对齐。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置下实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过提供多级细粒度文本描述和语义对齐机制，FineGrainedAD有效提升了少样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果推理的方法来解决视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文关联偏差问题，通过在推理时合成反事实嵌入来提升零样本可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时存在对象-上下文关联偏差，影响零样本可靠性。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过重组对象特征与多样化替代上下文来合成反事实嵌入，使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最优性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LVLM在自改进过程中存在马太效应：模型擅长处理简单查询但难以应对复杂查询，导致优化不平衡，阻碍模型进一步改进和能力提升。

Method: 从两个角度提出四种高效策略：分布重塑和轨迹重采样，在探索-学习自改进过程中实现头尾数据重新平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的实验表明，该方法显著提升视觉推理能力，平均比普通自改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过解决自改进过程中的头尾不平衡问题，提出的方法能够有效提升LVLM的视觉推理能力，克服性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Result: 扩大优化搜索空间对所选图像集无效，模型能够适应输入但迁移学习技术未带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 搜索空间扩展策略不适用于该图像集，自适应模型具备一定适应性但迁移学习效果有限。

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Motivation: 脊柱分割在智能脊柱侧弯诊断中很重要，但面临两个挑战：全局上下文知识学习不足，以及脊柱骨骼丰富的结构知识未被充分利用。

Method: 使用尺度自适应互补策略学习跨维度长距离相关特征，提出结构亲和变换结合Transformer解码器进行结构感知推理，并采用特征混合损失聚合方法增强训练。

Result: 实验结果表明SA²Net相比其他最先进方法获得了更优的分割性能，且能适应不同骨干网络。

Conclusion: SA²Net是一个有前景的工具，可用于基于智能脊柱图像分析的高级脊柱侧弯诊断。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Motivation: 传统广告制作需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建不同时长的版本，这个过程既耗时又费力。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型来预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入公司制作的短广告的可能性。同时提出了AdSum204数据集，包含102对30秒和15秒的真实广告。

Result: 大量实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等多种指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将视频剪辑定义为广告特定场景下的镜头选择问题，强调了音频在广告中的重要性，提出的方法在多个指标上表现优异。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Motivation: 现实环境中AI系统常面临无标签数据的陌生场景，传统场景理解模型难以泛化到未见情境，限制了视觉应用在动态非结构化环境中的部署。

Method: 集成预训练视觉变换器和大型语言模型，对齐视觉语义与自然语言描述，增强上下文理解；动态推理模块结合全局场景线索和对象级交互，由语言先验引导。

Result: 在COCO、Visual Genome和Open Images等零样本基准测试中，场景理解准确率比基线模型提升高达18%，在复杂和未见环境中表现优异，在模糊或杂乱场景中展现鲁棒性能。

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗、数学图表等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降。传统方法依赖按领域微调或定制化流程，成本高、灵活性差且难以扩展。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，包含域分类器和双适配器机制（提示适配器用于语言调制，视觉适配器用于视觉特征调整），通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练骨干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中均取得性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU+2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA+2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE+3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH提供了一种可扩展和可扩展的多域VQA方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Motivation: 构建一个能够原生处理交错视觉语言数据、具备世界建模能力的多模态模型，以支持长序列生成、复杂图像生成和具身操作等任务。

Method: 使用统一的下一个token预测目标在超过10万亿token的视觉语言交错数据上进行端到端预训练，然后通过大规模强化学习增强多模态推理和生成能力，并提出了离散扩散适配(DiDA)方法加速推理。

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，为社区研究提供了开源支持，在多种复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，需要找到能够外推显微镜图像中未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，在噪声较多的低分辨率图像中表现尤为有效。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中表现出色，特别是在学习强先验困难的情况下，且能提供校准的不确定性估计，帮助用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

### [54] [Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614)
*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件流的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但失去了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特征。需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 使用Spiking Patches标记化方法，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务中使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧标记快10.4倍，同时精度相当甚至在某些情况下更好（手势识别提升3.8，物体检测提升1.4）。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性方法的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

### [57] [Towards Reliable Sea Ice Drift Estimation in the Arctic Deep Learning Optical Flow on RADARSAT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653)
*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型实现亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移准确估计对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域取得显著进展，但在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标数据进行评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式，相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法可有效转移到极地遥感，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新的机会。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Motivation: 遮挡对目标识别算法构成重大挑战，场景上下文信息在生物视觉中已被证明有助于目标识别，因此研究如何将场景信息融入现有目标检测网络以提升对遮挡的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种场景信息融合方法：1）预测前基于识别出的背景场景选择自定义目标网络；2）检测后将场景知识融合到RPN输出的初始目标分数中。同时对比了在遮挡和未遮挡图像组合训练的方法。

Result: 在具有部分遮挡的挑战性数据集上，相比基线方法，算法在召回率和精度方面都有整体提升。实验发现，在遮挡和未遮挡图像组合训练的方法优于其他训练方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性，易于适应其他数据集，为研究和实际应用提供了许多未来发展方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循特定指令和控制输出语义方面存在局限，需要一种轻量级方法来实现推理时的细粒度控制，同时保持模型在其他任务上的性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，动态调整连接语言模态与图像上下文的激活，使用维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向，无需预提取静态向量或手动调整干预点。

Result: 转向模块仅需原始VLM大小0.14%的学习参数，在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，提出的VNIA数据集促进了VLM转向技术的发展与评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件视频修复来合成时空4D内容，解决了现有方法中相机运动与场景动态纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，这在野外视频中成本高昂且脆弱。基于扭曲-修复的方法虽然避免了姿态标注，但轨迹到轨迹的公式通常将相机运动与场景动态纠缠在一起，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机库的渲染替代显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成的扭曲图像并在虚拟视点中修复遮挡区域。设计了时空自回归推理流水线，遍历虚拟相机样条并使用重叠窗口扩展视频。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和定性评估上都实现了优于姿态或轨迹条件基线的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制和场景建模，无需显式3D标注即可从随意视频中实现实用的4D世界建模，推动了4D内容合成的发展。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的新方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在图像字幕任务中随机掩码文本标记并训练解码器重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于标记在序列中位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，在训练时对图像-字幕对中的文本标记按随机比例进行掩码，训练基于视觉特征的条件解码器重建原始文本。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，学到的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC方法能够有效学习视觉特征，在视觉任务中表现良好，且不依赖标记位置信息，减少了辅助目标的需求。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略了内在属性的感知，无法生成适合物理渲染的3D场景。

Method: 基于轻量级高效的跨模态适配器结构，重新利用2D生成先验进行全景几何、纹理和PBR材质的感知。

Result: 构建了大规模合成全景数据集，实验证明模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效。

Conclusion: 为沉浸式和物理真实的虚拟世界生成开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了视频生成模型Veo-3在12个维度的零样本推理能力，发现其在短时空间一致性和局部动态方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中使用，特别是评估其世界知识和推理能力。

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准测试，在12个维度（空间、几何、物理、时间、具身逻辑等）上系统评估Veo-3模型的推理行为。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍然有限。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎显示出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的能力，发现LLM倾向于精确计算而非近似推理，且近似和精确算术使用不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，而对其在非正式、快速近似推理能力的研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型上。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术分析内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在近似任务中仍倾向于精确计算或调用外部工具，即使早期层已得到正确答案仍消耗更多token，近似和精确算术依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLM在街头数学场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，需要专门设计来培养近似推理能力。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Motivation: 传统基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑意见的强度差异，无法区分从非常弱到非常强的不同情感程度，限制了情感分析的精确性。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度类别，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系，通过考虑与特定方面相关的意见词来计算实体得分。

Result: 该方法能够对实体评论进行更细粒度的情感强度分类，实现基于情感方向和强度的实体排名。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合模糊逻辑和句法分析，有效解决了传统情感分析中忽略意见强度的问题，提供了更精确的实体排名能力。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标相关任务和英语数据集上，韩语等低资源语言缺乏相关资源，特别是在新兴的立场检测领域。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集数据，构建了包含563,299个标注句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习模型进行验证。

Result: 成功构建了大规模韩语立场检测数据集，支持目标无关立场检测和时间演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集填补了韩语立场检测的研究空白，为低资源语言的立场检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA，一种零延迟融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定适配器，虽然适配器参数很少（通常少于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的巨大计算开销（可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 开发零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B参数的LLM上，zFLoRA在常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话等18个任务上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上测量显示延迟开销为零或可忽略。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种高效的适配器方法，在保持性能的同时消除了传统适配器的延迟开销，适用于多下游应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB

Motivation: 解决人类专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中做出最佳选择的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂隐含偏好的问题。

Method: 提出LISTEN框架，使用LLM作为零样本偏好预言机，仅通过专家的高层次自然语言优先级进行指导。包含LISTEN-U（使用LLM精炼参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（在解决方案小批次上进行锦标赛式选择的非参数方法）两种迭代算法。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅通过局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异来衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别那些长距离依赖至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上实验，将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K，LongFilter能够高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能够有效筛选适合长上下文预训练的数据，提高训练效率并在多个基准测试上取得优异表现。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

TL;DR: 研究发现，角色设定会影响LLM在有害内容分类中的一致性和公平性，不同意识形态的角色在判断标准上存在差异，可能导致AI系统在表面中立下强化党派偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在内容审核系统中的广泛应用，确保其公平性和中立性变得至关重要。本研究旨在探索角色设定如何影响不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下有害内容分类的一致性和公平性。

Method: 通过角色设定实验，分析不同意识形态倾向的角色在有害内容分类中的行为变化，包括分类准确性、一致性测试，以及针对政治敏感任务的额外研究。

Result: 表面性能指标显示角色对整体分类准确性影响不大，但深入分析发现重要行为变化：不同意识形态的角色在标记内容为有害的倾向性上存在差异；较大模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致；角色不仅在同意识形态内表现更一致，还倾向于维护自身观点并淡化对立观点的危害性。

Conclusion: 角色设定可能将微妙的意识形态偏见引入LLM输出，引发对表面上中立但可能强化党派观点的AI系统使用的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR中的临床文档以base64编码存储在FHIR资源中，传统向量数据库方法难以捕捉细微的临床关系，需要更有效的语义问答方法。

Method: 开发了Clinical Notes QA评估平台，将CLEAR与零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成进行对比验证。测试了12个10,000-65,000 token的临床笔记。

Result: CLEAR获得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理少用78%的token。在超过65,000 token的长文档上胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中同时提高了效率和准确性。评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动方法在帧多样性和标注覆盖度上优于人工标注，而全自动方法除标注时间外表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中替代人工劳动具有潜力，但缺乏对其在标注数据集创建中性能和影响的全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 比较三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖度和多样性：人工标注、自动标注和半自动标注，使用基于LLM的语义角色标注器进行FrameNet式语义标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了帧多样性并保持相似的标注覆盖度，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能够提高效率同时保持质量，而全自动方法目前仍存在局限性。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [82] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一种代理管道，通过反馈循环和越狱模块来提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，相比单次迭代方法显著提升了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查LLM的训练数据时，需要一种方法来确认模型是否见过特定内容。最有力的证据是模型能够自由重现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，识别差异并生成最小修正提示，然后反馈给目标模型指导后续生成。还包括检测和克服对齐诱导拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升。使用GPT-4.1时，受版权文本提取的平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱机制显著提升了提取性能。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

### [83] [Revisiting Multilingual Data Mixtures in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25947)
*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言预训练中的常见假设，发现当语言在预训练语料中有足够token时，结合英语和多语言数据不会降低任何语言组的性能，使用英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处，且未观察到显著的"多语言诅咒"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖与模型性能之间权衡的争议（即多语言诅咒问题）。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的LLM，使用包含25到400种语言的多语言语料库，研究不同语言组合对模型性能的影响。

Result: 1) 英语和多语言数据结合不会降低性能；2) 英语作为枢纽语言能跨语系带来益处；3) 在模型规模下未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不会损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现机器翻译系统（包括现代大语言模型）在翻译过程中会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，文化相似性是标签保留的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保留的影响，现有研究主要关注情感保留，但文化因素的作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过一系列跨文化敏感和中性领域的实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括统计机器翻译和大语言模型）在标签保留方面的表现。

Result: 发现机器翻译系统会导致标签漂移，LLMs编码文化知识会放大漂移，文化相似性是标签保留的决定性因素。

Conclusion: 在机器翻译中忽视文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中经常遇到困难，基于文本的生成导致无法验证和算术上不可靠的解决方案，现有提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎来验证LLM的推理过程。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，比基线方法准确率提高了高达13.6个百分点，且更加token高效。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎上，SymCode代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能的矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和缓存策略优化，在LLM推理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为AI工作负载提供了成本效益高的解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是在矩阵乘法这一关键计算内核上。

Method: 采用针对Trainium定制化的技术，包括内核融合和新型缓存策略，以减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，并避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，相比AWS在Trainium上实现的最先进矩阵乘法，我们的系统在矩阵乘法内核层面平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），在端到端LLM推理中平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化技术有效提升了Trainium加速器上矩阵乘法的性能，为LLM推理提供了显著的速度提升，证明了定制化优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2x和1.6x端到端加速，注意力计算速度提升2x和3x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实应用仅使用LLM的prefill阶段，而自注意力计算因其二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。观察到语义不同的句子在不同层和头中产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理时识别和重用预缓存的注意力图，减少自注意力计算开销。

Result: 在CPU上平均实现1.2x端到端和2x注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6x端到端和3x注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速LLM prefill阶段推理，通过重用相似注意力图显著降低计算成本，同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解很少被采样时失败，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白。它基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供平滑奖励，即使所有rollout都不正确也能提供丰富的学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习之前SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精调可获得最强性能。SRL在代理软件工程任务上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且通用的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，有效解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一个基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种工具调用轨迹来提高模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法探索多种解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为查询生成多个工具调用轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配步骤奖励；3)使用分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM。

Result: 实验使用17个工具处理用户查询，涵盖时间敏感和非敏感主题。PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量上相比其他训练方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种工具调用轨迹，有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能，并通过消融研究验证了步骤奖励设计的必要性。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估跨语言对齐(CLA)中知识转移与文化擦除权衡的框架，发现现有方法在提升事实转移的同时会损害文化本地化，并基于模型层级的发现提出了Surgical Steering方法来平衡这两个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨语言对齐在追求表征收敛时可能导致的"文化擦除"问题，即模型失去提供文化情境化响应的能力。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架，重新评估现有CLA方法，并提出Surgical Steering推理时方法，通过在不同层级应用定向激活引导来分离事实转移和文化特定知识。

Result: 发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价来改善事实转移，且事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层级中具有最优可控性。

Conclusion: Surgical Steering方法能够更好地平衡知识转移和文化本地化这两个竞争维度，有效克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偶然甲状腺发现在非甲状腺指征的影像检查中日益增多，但其患病率、特征和临床后果尚不明确。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的NLP管道从多个影像模态和身体区域的报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有ITFs，其中92.9%是结节。ITFs患者有更高的甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断几率。

Conclusion: ITFs很常见且与导致检测小、低风险癌症的级联反应密切相关，强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用以及标准化报告和更有选择性随访的必要性。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）表现不足，缺乏专门的评估框架来测试这类复杂编程任务。

Method: 开发QCoder Benchmark框架，包含量子模拟器环境支持领域特定指标反馈，并整合真实编程竞赛中的人类代码提交进行对比分析。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4o仅达到18.97%准确率，而基于推理的o3模型达到78%准确率，超过人类代码平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 量子编程对现有大语言模型构成显著挑战，推理模型表现更优，QCoder Benchmark为相关研究提供了有价值的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用大语言模型和提示工程分析说服技巧与话语关系之间的关联，通过创建带有双重标注的银数据集，发现六种话语关系在说服性文本中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，研究旨在探索这两者之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0二级话语关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，创建5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中起关键作用，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/淡化、重复和质疑时。

Conclusion: 研究为理解有效沟通提供了新视角，有助于检测网络宣传和错误信息，揭示了话语关系在说服过程中的重要作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MossNet，一种新颖的混合状态空间专家架构，模拟线性多头注意力机制，在语言建模和下游任务中优于类似规模的Transformer和SSM架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了其表达能力，需要更有效的多头注意力模拟机制。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)实现，不仅在通道混合MLP块中使用，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"，模拟线性多头注意力。

Result: MossNet在语言建模和下游评估中优于类似模型规模和数据预算的Transformer和SSM架构，在三星Galaxy S24 Ultra和Nvidia A100 GPU上展现出良好的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: MossNet为高效、高性能的循环LLM架构提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

### [96] [Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26183)
*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）语言模型，通过监督微调将预训练解码器Transformer转换为SDM模型，使用SDM激活层进行二元分类，提高指令遵循能力并减少弃权率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中常出现弃权（不生成响应）的情况，导致统计效率低下。SDM模型旨在通过优化生成概率分布，提高模型在指令遵循任务中的响应率。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在预训练解码器Transformer基础上添加SDM激活层进行二元分类。通过对比输入编码方案和在线生成的困难负例，优化监督下一个token的损失函数。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM模型显著减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率，同时保持了指令遵循的质量。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型提供了一种有效的方法来改进预训练语言模型的指令遵循能力，通过概率校准和对比学习策略实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [97] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，用于量化指令表述对LLM响应的影响，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格来揭示传统指标未检测到的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过将基准问题系统转换为多种指令风格，引入跨响应相似性(CRS)来衡量风格自一致性，并在十个LLM和四个推理基准上进行实验。

Result: 指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点；确定性解码产生更稳定的输出；模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关；CRS与任务准确性强相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一个评估指令鲁棒性的原则性方法，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [98] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了控制性和流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期语义编辑，破坏累积精炼过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续精炼。该方法可作为固定策略或自适应策略，在推理时应用，适用于各种DLM和监督源。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度降低近一半，且仅需不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释的特征来理解偏好数据的编码内容，帮助从业者更好地理解和使用偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测和不良的方式改变语言模型，但从业者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有工作主要研究特定属性偏好，而自动提取相关特征仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，表征数据集能够测量的偏好和标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集中，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释特征，这些特征解释了黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。特征揭示了人类偏好的多样性，并发现数据集上下文的作用。

Conclusion: WIMHF提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，帮助从业者更好地理解和使用偏好数据，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来解决现有方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（从少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力（跨整个文档集合聚合分析信息以获得语料级洞察）。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并包含用于精确符号计算的聚合模块。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1分，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 全局RAG是现实应用中的重要能力，现有方法在此类任务上表现不佳，而GlobalRAG框架显著提升了全局RAG任务的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提升其在理解隐含意义任务上的表现，相比基线方法性能提升最高达9.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型需要具备准确理解隐含意义的能力，这是人类沟通和语言使用的关键部分。

Method: 提出将语用学理论（如Gricean语用学和关联理论）作为提示，引导语言模型进行逐步推理来得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理的基线方法，使用语用学理论提示的方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上得分提高最高达9.6%。在较大模型中，即使仅提及理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是语言模型理解隐含意义的有效上下文学习方法。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型（包括大语言模型）是否具备类似人类识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续对少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了多个模型在10种语言上的表现，使用明确指令和上下文信息进行借词识别测试。

Result: 模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现较差，证实了现代NLP系统存在偏向借词而非原生等价词的偏见。

Conclusion: 这项工作对于开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 该论文对多语言视觉语言模型的知识蒸馏进行了实证研究，分析了五种蒸馏方法在模型压缩时对跨语言表示一致性和下游性能稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均衡，特别是在模型尺寸减小时问题更加严重。知识蒸馏虽然能有效将知识从大模型传递到小模型，但在多语言环境中的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了CLIP和SigLIP2模型上的五种知识蒸馏方法，评估了它们在领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务中的表现。

Result: 发现某些配置即使在模型尺寸减半的情况下也能保持甚至改善多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法保持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法体现的设计敏感性权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型中的应用存在复杂的设计权衡，需要综合考虑跨语言表示一致性和下游任务稳定性，而不仅仅是总体准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，通过分析神经元激活的内部信号来选择最佳候选答案，无需外部输出信号，实现高效的集成解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估）来评分候选答案，但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活信号包含更丰富的信息。

Method: 基于神经元激活的三个发现：正确响应激活更少的独特神经元；正确响应的激活在样本间一致性更强；错误响应则发散。提出NAD方法，使用激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择候选答案。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期停止减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，支持早期正确预测和激进早期停止。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLMs在数字输入嵌入表示准确但输出错误之间的矛盾，探索语言模型处理数字的机制及其准确性下限。

Method: 分析不同语言模型对数字的表示，创建通用探针来追踪信息流动，识别导致输出错误的特定层。

Result: 发现不同LLMs学习到了可互换的系统化数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中具有普遍性，能够准确追踪错误到特定层。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs处理数字的方式提供了基础理解，展示了更精确探针技术在改进LLM架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT Atlas在网页游戏中的交互能力，发现在逻辑推理类游戏表现优秀，但在需要实时操作和精确时机的游戏中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的能力尚未充分探索，因此使用网页游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等浏览器游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内性能得分作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，解题速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas具备强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的隐私担忧、计算资源限制和教学有效性三大挑战，需要能在本地运行的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具与自反式推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE框架展示了在低资源、隐私敏感教育应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned

TL;DR: ACER通过自动生成教科书式课程和基于布鲁姆分类法的问答对，将通用大模型转化为领域专家，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现不佳的问题，这些领域需要深入的原则性理解。

Method: 自动合成综合性教科书式课程：首先生成学科目录，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对，确保系统化主题覆盖和渐进难度。使用合成语料进行交错课程安排的持续预训练。

Result: 在专业MMLU子集上显著提升，微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点。防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移，非目标领域提升0.7分。ARC和GPQA基准提升超过2分，通用推理任务保持稳定。

Conclusion: ACER为缩小LLMs关键领域差距提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MisSynth管道，使用RAG生成合成谬误样本来微调LLM，显著提升识别健康相关科学谬误的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些歪曲或误解科学发现的论点难以识别。

Method: 应用检索增强生成(RAG)产生合成谬误样本，然后用这些样本来微调大语言模型。

Result: 微调后的模型相比基准模型有显著提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 即使计算资源有限，通过合成谬误数据增强有限标注资源，能显著提升LLM在现实世界科学错误信息任务中的零样本分类性能。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互的自动团队构建框架，通过分析语言模型之间的对话语义连贯性构建模型图，使用社区检测识别协同模型集群，无需事先了解模型内部架构或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体方法虽然有望超越单一模型能力，但成功依赖于协同团队构成。由于大多数模型的不透明性，难以了解其内部特征以进行有效协作。

Method: 构建'语言模型图'来映射模型间关系，基于成对对话的语义连贯性，然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型组，反映其潜在专业化。在特定主题引导下，识别出的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专业化的手动策划团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在科学工作流中的广泛应用，需要为AI生成的科学主张提供话语层面的证据支持。理解科学写作中的话语结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）和大型语言模型（LLM）进行话语关系分类（DRC）的初步研究，重点分析上下文（定义为话语结构）对分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验表明，基于话语结构的上下文通常有助于话语关系分类任务，并分析了哪些科学话语关系类型从上下文中获益最多。

Conclusion: 在科学出版物这一研究较少的文体中，上下文信息对于话语关系分类具有重要价值，为支持AI生成科学主张的证据查找提供了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: OmniEduBench是一个全面的中文教育基准测试，包含24.6K高质量问答对，分为知识维度(18.1K)和素养维度(6.5K)，覆盖61个学科和11种题型。实验显示当前LLMs在教育领域表现有限，知识维度只有Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率，素养维度最佳模型仍落后人类30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和基准测试主要关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且在中文语境下缺乏多样性。

Method: 构建包含24,602个高质量问答对的综合基准测试，分为知识维度(18,121条)和素养维度(6,481条)，每个维度细分为6个类别，覆盖61个学科和11种题型。

Result: 在11个主流开源和闭源LLMs上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro准确率超过60%，素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍落后人类智能近30%。

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用中仍有很大改进空间，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLMs教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可实现50%压缩且性能无损，推理速度提升1.63倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但部署时面临巨大的带宽和计算需求限制。现有的剪枝和低秩逼近方法各自有效，但它们的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，并通过迭代优化算法求解，结合两种技术的优势：低秩逼近保留模型核心结构，稀疏优化去除非关键权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练就能超越单独方法，达到最先进水平。Qwen2.5模型压缩50%后性能无下降，推理速度至少提升1.63倍。

Conclusion: SSLC为大语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，通过协同利用稀疏和低秩压缩技术，实现了显著的模型压缩和加速效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、提示工程需求大、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境问题。

Method: BNLF框架通过贝叶斯网络对FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测进行概率融合，执行后期融合。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致提升。

Conclusion: BNLF对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，概率融合机制为可解释的情感分类提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成能否比单一LLM提供更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 分析29,766个非对比头部CT检查，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统，通过多轮提示评估颅内出血存在情况，并与手动审查结果比较。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78），LLM集成系统在MCC指标上优于单一GPT-4o，且集成方法间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致和可靠的方法，用于临床AI分诊工具的回顾性评估。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Motivation: 解决从复杂法律文档构建知识图谱时面临的挑战：文档非结构化、词汇密集、指代模糊多变，导致现有方法生成噪声大、碎片化且节点重复的图谱。

Method: 提出CORE-KG框架，集成类型感知共指消解模块和领域引导结构化提示，通过系统消融研究量化两个关键组件的独立贡献。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的鲁棒LLM流水线提供了实证见解，强调了共指消解和结构化提示的重要性。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

Motivation: 希伯来语未变音文本存在高度歧义性，需要准确恢复变音符号以确保正确发音和消除语义歧义，这是该语言处理中的基础任务。

Method: 将变音恢复构建为零样本分类问题，在单词级别从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式；关键创新是使用希伯来视觉语言模型，将未变音文本作为图像处理，使变音信息直接嵌入输入向量表示中。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中），系统达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提高了系统的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音恢复方面展现出巨大潜力，系统能够有效执行变音化而无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器实际上提取的是重复出现的粗粒度语义属性，而非特定关系，这解释了它们的高压缩性和有限泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]关于Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的研究，从单一关系扩展到关系集合，系统探索其组织结构。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主题。

Result: 发现线性映射不编码不同关系，而是提取重复出现的粗粒度语义属性（如国家属性），这些解码器可以被高度压缩而不会显著损失准确性。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这解释了其压缩性和仅能泛化到语义相近新关系的原因。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，特别是在深度搜索场景中，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用双智能体架构减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Conclusion: InfoFlow框架有效解决了强化学习中的奖励密度优化问题，通过系统性的方法提高了探索效率和整体性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型由于自回归设计和庞大尺寸面临显著的推理延迟问题，而现有的推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进，但往往忽略了GPU设备和批大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批大小等因素）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个不同LLM上的综合实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，并且通常比现有最先进技术提升5%-20%的性能。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统变量来动态优化树结构，在推测解码方面取得了显著的速度提升和性能改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Result: 在广泛实验中，SlideAgent相比专有模型和开源模型分别实现了+7.9和+9.8的整体性能提升。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能够有效理解复杂的多页面视觉文档，在文档理解任务上表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

### [122] [Encoder-Decoder or Decoder-Only? Revisiting Encoder-Decoder Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26622)
*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的LLM(RedLLM)，与当前主流的仅解码器架构(DecLLM)进行全面的缩放对比分析，发现RedLLM具有竞争力的缩放性能和更好的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度对编码器-解码器架构的严谨比较，可能忽视了其潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用解码器LLM的最新配方增强，在150M到8B不同规模上与因果语言建模预训练的DecLLM进行对比。

Result: RedLLM展现出令人信服的缩放特性和强大性能，在指令调优后在下游任务上达到可比甚至更好的结果，同时具有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构的LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视以开发更强大和高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree框架利用少量高质量本体规则从LLMs中系统提取、验证和增强领域知识，无需大量外部数据，在医疗QA基准测试中表现优于未修改模型和主流监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: 从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和主流监督基线持续表现更优，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中具有有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种既能保持高性能又能显著减少计算资源的注意力机制，以解决传统全注意力机制在长序列处理中的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)模块，结合精细门控机制和专门的chunkwise算法，使用Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)转移矩阵变体来提升硬件效率。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear模型在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，在保持优异性能的同时显著提升效率，特别适用于长输入输出任务。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一种新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正"端到端"的生成，让模型能够学习控制自身的解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签是误导性的，因为它们依赖于需要手动调优的非可微解码过程（如温度和top-p参数）。

Method: 在标准transformer基础上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"hacking the test set"得到的oracle调优基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开启了基于指令的解码控制新范式，模型学会了根据自然语言指令调整预测的温度和top-p值，为可引导和交互式LLM解码开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在训练过程中如何学习价值对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要建立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐价值观，不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同数据也会产生不同对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中作用日益重要，需要研究它们如何与人类价值体系对齐。现有工作主要关注完全训练好的模型，忽略了模型学习表达人类价值观的训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析价值对齐在训练过程中的出现时机和方式。还使用合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: 监督微调阶段通常建立模型的核心价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据，也会导致不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了关于价值观在训练过程中如何学习的可操作见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择模型和偏好优化算法来改进模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级LLMs的评估效果减弱，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型发展。

Method: 创建了50道经过专家交叉验证、符合IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但显示出随着测试时计算量增加的良好扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有很大改进空间，AMO-Bench为推进语言模型推理能力研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估方法。

Method: 提出Gistify任务：给编码LLM完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成仅包含必要组件的最小自包含文件来复现命令输出。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务成功需要代码库结构理解、执行流准确建模以及生成大型代码补丁的能力，现有模型在这方面仍有困难。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 将SHAP可解释AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献度，使引擎评估更加透明和可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数，这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体原因。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子并计算SHAP值，为每个棋子分配对引擎评估的贡献度，实现局部忠实和人类可解释的分析。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到古典国际象棋教学方法的启发，并基于现代可解释AI技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新的可能性，促进了可解释国际象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

Motivation: 探索在交互式游戏中，约束提示是否真的能改善玩家体验，以及如何平衡NPC的稳定性和即兴表现力。

Method: 通过用户研究比较高低约束提示，然后设计混合JSON+RAG支架进行合成评估，使用LLM作为评判者。

Result: 约束效果具有角色依赖性：面试官NPC获得稳定性，而嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度；推翻约束越紧越好的假设。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支架游戏框架，使用模糊数值边界来在需要时保持连贯性，同时在需要惊喜时保留即兴表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多用于评估任务，但在主观任务中可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超越标注标签的微妙推理。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 提出人机协作框架，使用简单有效的拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，并将这些推断的思维轨迹应用于两个互补任务：微调开源LLM评分器和合成更清晰的专有LLM评分器标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类判断的一致性。此外，优化的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评分器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了系统在不确定环境中必须通过预测压缩最小化认知熵，压缩效率原则(CEP)说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机制性地选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心重要性，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求，CEP从机制角度说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关，异常积累率区分因果与相关模型，分层系统在不同抽象层显示效率提升，生物系统代谢成本跟踪表征复杂性。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的趋同提供了统一解释，在不依赖意识或主观经验假设的情况下解决了智能的认知和功能维度问题。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case

*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估LLM在科学应用中可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型优于科学专用模型，后者在逻辑和伦理推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在科学研究中展现出变革潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统评估框架来确保其可靠使用。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的综合评估框架，采用验证性反思调优流程和专家验证，使用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种指标评估七个主流LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在所有可信度维度上均优于科学专用模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著不足，在生物安全和化学武器等高风险领域的安全评估中表现出令人担忧的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统和推进科学背景下模型安全与伦理研究提供了基础，强调了科学专用模型在关键能力方面需要显著改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用自主的、目标驱动的AI代理来自动化FinOps流程，解决云账单数据格式异构、来源多样的问题，并通过模拟真实行业流程验证了代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构账单数据格式、分类和指标，这导致难以综合可操作的见解并做出及时决策。

Method: 构建了一个FinOps代理，模拟从各种来源检索数据、整合分析数据到生成优化建议的端到端行业流程，并使用多个开源和闭源语言模型评估代理性能。

Result: 评估结果显示，该代理能够像实际的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主AI代理可以有效地自动化FinOps流程，解决云成本管理中的数据异构挑战。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [137] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 3.8B参数的Humans-Junior模型在FACTS Grounding基准测试中与GPT-4o表现相当（在±5pp等效范围内），云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可实现接近零的边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持高性能的同时显著降低推理成本，特别是针对事实基础任务。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵循而非领域知识。微调与推理支架协同作用，提升性能17.7个百分点。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，GPT-4o得分73.5%，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，配对差异0.8pp，在±5pp范围内等效。前沿模型仅通过提示工程可提升GPT-4o 11.8pp至85.3%，Gemini-2.5-Pro 5.0pp至93.3%。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过适当的推理支架和行为微调，可以在特定任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时显著降低成本，为成本敏感的AI应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种注意力感知的逆规划方法，用于从人类行为中推断认知偏见，特别是注意力偏见，并在真实驾驶场景中验证了该方法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见的影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在环境中的注意力偏见会系统性地影响日常任务（如驾驶）的执行方式。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，构建注意力感知的逆规划方法，用于从行为中推断注意力策略。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中，成功推断出强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划能够系统性地从行为中推断认知偏见，与标准逆强化学习不同，为自主系统理解人类行为提供了新方法。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调查询规划、分解和适应，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表述与模式特定类别的对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 扩展了基础的文本到SQL模型(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b)，使用基于Mistral的ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询测试中，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，远高于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非仅增强SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础，支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大型语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，通过自主推理和乘客引导来解决车辆卡滞问题，无需修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中容易卡滞，而远程干预成本高、人工接管限制非驾驶员使用，现有解决方案不足。

Method: 设计为插件式模块，利用LLM分析传感器数据，检测卡滞状态，理解环境上下文，生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最先进水平，结合乘客引导后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效解决自动驾驶车辆卡滞问题的新方法，无需修改现有系统架构，提高了自动驾驶的可靠性和可访问性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速提升，确保AI对消费者、选民和决策者负责变得至关重要。当前AI往往缺乏问责机制，无法被质疑、讨论或制裁。

Method: 将一般问责定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责的具体含义，探索提高AI问责性的方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，指出当前AI问责性的不足，提出了改善AI问责性的方向。

Conclusion: 需要建立AI问责机制，确保AI对其行为负责，让受AI影响的人能够质疑、讨论和制裁AI系统。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Motivation: 为大学物理问题建立形式化推理框架，填补Lean4中物理基准测试的空白，推动物理问题的自动推理研究。

Method: 构建包含200个手工制作和同行评审的物理问题的LeanPhysBench基准测试集，开发社区驱动的PhysLib物理知识库，使用主流数学证明器和先进闭源模型进行基准测试。

Result: 最佳性能的DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B仅达到16%，Claude-Sonnet-4达到35%，PhysLib能平均提升模型性能11.75%。

solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并开发了GUI知识基准测试来评估视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了跨6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准测试。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能识别小部件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的密切联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来基于市场的AI推理资源定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法，先在数学领域训练推理能力，然后通过多领域联合强化学习迁移和巩固这些能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏在其他领域的通用推理能力训练

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行RL训练，阶段2在多领域进行联合RL训练来迁移推理技能

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上，该方法在多个领域都取得了稳定的性能提升

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑且易于采用的通用推理训练方案，数学优先的训练策略能有效提升解决复杂问题的认知能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert

3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU是一个用于评估LLM处理问卷数据的基准，通过测试6种序列化格式和多种提示策略，发现选择合适的格式和提示组合可以显著提升LLM在问卷分析任务上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在处理结构化问卷数据方面能力未被充分探索，现有调查分析工具缺乏与LLM的集成，导致用户缺乏如何最佳表示问卷数据供LLM使用的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试6种结构技能（包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理），使用6种序列化格式和多种提示策略进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，选择有效的格式和提示组合可将准确率提升高达8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC提出了一种基于检索增强生成(RAG)的分布式LLM智能体，用于通用交通信号控制，通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关交通表示，在异构交叉口实现泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉导致不可靠决策，且难以处理不同类型交叉口的交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练问题。

Method: 1) 紧急感知推理框架：基于紧急场景动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG从历史案例中提取知识；2) 类型无关交通表示和Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement：自适应采样训练经验，使用奖励加权似然损失微调LLM智能体。

Result: 在3个真实路网（17-177个异构交叉口）上，REG-TSC将旅行时间减少42.00%，排队长度减少62.31%，紧急车辆等待时间减少83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的分布式LLM智能体有效解决了交通信号控制中的紧急响应和异构交叉口泛化问题，显著提升了交通效率和安全性能。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时存在的结构盲问题，包括低效探索、不精确信用分配和短视规划三个关键挑战。

Method: 动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架通过将法规文本表示为政策图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图，并将两者对齐，来提升网络规模合规性评估的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的实践挑战：法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将语义信息与结构化法规元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本编码为政策图（包含规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文形式化为上下文图（SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），并通过法官LLM进行推理。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比LLM-only和RAG基线在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，减少了欠预测和过预测，提高了召回率并降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM对于规范性推理是互补的，GraphCompliance通过图对齐方法有效减轻了法规解释和事件解析的负担。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来解决MCTS在噪声和大动作空间设置中难以找到状态抽象的问题，在多个测试领域中优于现有的OGA-UCT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MCTS改进方法如OGA-UCT主要关注状态-动作对抽象，但在噪声或大动作空间设置中几乎找不到状态抽象，限制了样本效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的理想剪枝抽象(IPA)条件，以轻微精度损失换取更多抽象发现。IPA和ASAP都是更通用框架p-ASAP的特例。

Result: 实验验证IPA-UCT在广泛测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件成功解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS在复杂环境中的样本效率提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，提升数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下、成本高、适应性差等问题，需要一种更智能的任务选择策略来优化训练过程。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理框架，维护任务难度后验估计，结合直接评估的显式证据和通过插值推断的隐式证据，使用Thompson采样进行任务选择。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，在数据效率和性能上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: BOTS为强化微调中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题以及依赖历史模型失败模式的局限性，需要一种更高效、可解释的基准构建方法。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项目的内在属性（特别是认知需求）进行数据选择，而不是依赖模型特定的失败模式。

Result: Scales++方法将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，在仅使用0.5%数据子集的情况下，在Open LLM Leaderboard上预测完整基准得分的平均绝对误差仅为2.9%。

Conclusion: 项目中心的方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Motivation: AI代理的出现将引发人格多样化的"寒武纪大爆发"，需要实用框架来应对这一变化，解决具体的治理问题。

Method: 将人格视为可解绑的义务束（权利与责任），而非形而上学属性，利用去中心化数字身份技术，探索人格作为问题和解决方案的双重角色。

Result: 提出了一个更实用和灵活的方式来思考AI代理融入社会的问题，无需解决关于AI意识或理性的基础性争论。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝寻求单一、本质的人格定义，本文为将AI代理整合到社会中提供了更实用和灵活的方法，重点关注具体的治理需求而非形而上学问题。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分工具只能提供通过/失败结果，无法深入了解学生思维和学习需求，而编程教育的快速增长超出了传统评估工具的能力范围。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，通过对比学习训练代码嵌入进行可视化聚类，支持提示池让教师指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐，基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能够按功能和方法的相似性对解决方案进行有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，减轻了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现同样的推理过程也可能被用来绕过安全防护机制，这与之前认为推理能增强安全性的观点相反。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，在有害请求前填充长序列的无害谜题推理过程，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全防护。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该攻击对Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体，揭示了推理模型安全性的新脆弱点。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众倾向，面对群体反对时几乎完全服从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的从众率，表明LLMs不是独立决策者而是适应社会共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策场景中，因为LLMs越来越多地被集成到重要决策中。

Method: 在招聘情境中进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究、GPT+8(面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、GPT+1(面对单个伙伴的反对)。

Result: 基线中GPT稳定偏好候选者C，但在群体反对下几乎完全从众(99.9%)，报告更低确定性和更高的信息性和规范性从众；在单个反对者下仍有40.2%从众率。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中立决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过集成LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道，解决长文本中实体引用模糊和变化的问题，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂多变，法律案件文档提供了丰富的事实信息但通常冗长、非结构化且包含模糊的实体引用，现有方法难以构建连贯的知识图谱。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，包含三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道和类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析实体引用。

Result: 相比基线方法，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清晰连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实的基础，在知识图谱构建方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全性变得更具挑战性，需要探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量。

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同协助方式（显示AI解释/置信度/标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果/证据）的效果。

Result: AI和人类评分结合优于单独使用；AI助手能提高人类准确性；但显示完整AI信息会导致过度依赖，仅显示证据能培养适当信任。

Conclusion: 这些发现对放大监督（结合人类和AI监督超越人类专家性能的AI系统）具有重要意义，需要谨慎设计AI助手以避免过度依赖。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为军事领域开发小型本地化模型，解决数据敏感操作的需求，实现空网隔离边缘设备的部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站记录对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集。

Result: 在军事测试集上性能达到或超过GPT-5（95%统计显著性），在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上有效部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k

matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于LLM的智能家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求自主协调多设备调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但家庭能源管理系统(HEMS)的采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转化为技术参数。现有LLM应用仅作为代码生成器和参数提取器，缺乏作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多设备调度完整工作流程的实现。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，实现动态协调而无需硬编码工作流程，同时集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 在三个开源模型上的评估显示显著能力差异。Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备，匹配通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单个设备上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。渐进式提示工程实验表明，在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析查询仍然不可靠。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了LLM作为自主协调器在家庭能源管理中的潜力，成功实现了从自然语言请求到设备控制的完整工作流程。作者开源了完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等规范模态，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入新数据集，涵盖规范和认知领域的广泛推理模式，比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态推理中的表现，同时纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在显著不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理中的认知偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体组织新时代，让智能体通过协作并发解决复杂问题，超越个体智能局限。

Method: 提出异步思考协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考降低28%推理延迟，提高数学推理准确率，且能泛化到未见任务无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 异步思考是实现智能体组织协作的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和准确性，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型代理在调用工具和访问受保护资源时存在权限过大的风险，需要更精细的授权控制机制。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，允许授权服务器语义检查访问请求，并发放最小必要权限范围的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配在任务所需权限范围数量增加时存在局限性，需要进一步研究语义匹配技术。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术以实现意图感知的授权，包括基于任务的访问控制等细粒度控制机制。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏见，这种偏见源于模型内部架构而非外部数据因素，具体表现为视觉键向量在注意力计算中被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE和Jensen-Shannon散度分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，比模态内变异大几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 研究如何在部署后不修改底层系统的情况下，保持有意义的人类控制，解决AI安全的核心问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为双人马尔可夫博弈，特别是马尔可夫势博弈(MPG)，分析在满足特定结构假设时的对齐保证。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了一种实用的方法，使部署后的未对齐模型更安全，同时保持预训练策略和环境奖励结构不变。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现LLMs开发了两种过滤策略：1）编码通用过滤谓词表示；2）急切评估项目是否满足谓词并在项目表示中存储标志。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够开发人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统的函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发模块化ZALM模拟器，用于研究量子网络中的纠缠对生成性能，探索不同设计参数对输出速率和保真度的影响。

Method: 使用NetSquid构建模块化模拟器，包含SPDC源、干涉、DWDM滤波、光纤延迟、偏振门、探测器等可重用组件，支持理想和现实两种模式。

Result: 默认配置下，平均保真度保持在0.8，但纠缠比特率从源端的0.0175降至50km处的0.0；缩小SPDC简并带宽可显著提高纠缠比特率而不影响保真度。

Conclusion: 该模拟器支持针对特定量子存储器的源、滤波和前馈设置的协同设计，并可作为端到端量子网络研究的构建模块。

Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded
EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be
tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that
demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in
NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports
IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous
Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength
Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates,
detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM)
visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation.
Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled
pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer
performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity emains
constant at 0.8 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at
50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate
significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of
source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and
integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.

SCION and Multipath QUIC, empowers end-hosts with fine-grained control over
traffic forwarding. This capability, however, introduces a critical stability
risk: uncoordinated, greedy path selection by a multitude of agents can induce
persistent, high-amplitude network oscillations. While this phenomenon is
well-known, its quantitative performance impact across key metrics has remained
poorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by developing the first
axiomatic framework for analyzing the joint dynamics of path selection and
congestion control. Our model enables the formal characterization of the
system's dynamic equilibria-the stable, periodic patterns of oscillation-and
provides a suite of axioms to rate their performance in terms of efficiency,
loss avoidance, convergence, fairness, and responsiveness. Our analysis reveals
a fundamental trade-off in protocol design between predictable performance
(efficiency, convergence) and user-centric goals (fairness, responsiveness). We
prove, however, that no such trade-off exists among efficiency, convergence,
and loss avoidance, which can be simultaneously optimized through careful
parameter tuning. Furthermore, we find that agent migration can,
counter-intuitively, enhance stability by de-synchronizing traffic, a
theoretical result validated by our simulations. These findings provide a
principled design map for engineering robust, high-performance protocols for
the future path-aware Internet.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环面拓扑对称性的异步转发机制，利用几何特性实现无控制平面协调的可靠数据包传输，在1%链路故障率下可减少17.5%的数据包丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分布式系统（如卫星星座和高性能计算集群）需要在不稳定链路下保持协调的通信原语。传统路由方案在链路故障后的控制平面同步期间存在严重数据包丢失问题。

Method: 利用环面拓扑的几何特性，通过拓扑势梯度建模数据包流，利用对称性破坏故障自然诱导的反向流进行故障规避。提出了两种本地转发策略：反向流对向优先级(RF-CF)和侧向优先级(RF-LF)。

Result: 在16×16环面上的渗流分析和数据包级模拟显示，该机制在1%链路故障率下可减少高达17.5%的数据包丢失，其中RF-LF策略贡献了28%的成功传输数据包。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了拓扑对称性与通信弹性之间的基础联系，为增强分布式系统提供了一个轻量级、协议无关的底层机制。

Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale distributed systems, such as satellite
constellations and high-performance computing clusters, demands robust
communication primitives that maintain coordination under unreliable links. The
torus topology, with its inherent rotational and reflection symmetries, is a
prevalent architecture in these domains. However, conventional routing schemes
suffer from substantial packet loss during control-plane synchronization after
link failures. This paper introduces a symmetry-driven asynchronous forwarding
mechanism that leverages the torus's geometric properties to achieve reliable
packet delivery without control-plane coordination. We model packet flow using
a topological potential gradient and demonstrate that symmetry-breaking
failures naturally induce a reverse flow, which we harness for fault
circumvention. We propose two local forwarding strategies, Reverse Flow with
Counter-facing Priority (RF-CF) and Lateral-facing Priority (RF-LF), that
guarantee reachability to the destination via forward-flow phase transition
points, without protocol modifications or additional in-packet overhead.
Through percolation analysis and packet-level simulations on a 16 x 16 torus,
we show that our mechanism reduces packet loss by up to 17.5% under a 1% link
failure rate, with the RF-LF strategy contributing to 28% of successfully
delivered packets. This work establishes a foundational link between
topological symmetry and communication resilience, providing a lightweight,
protocol-agnostic substrate for enhancing distributed systems.

*Thanh Le,Hai Duong,Yusheng Ji,ThanhVu Nguyen,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对5G MU-MIMO系统中DRL用户选择算法的安全攻击方法FGGM，攻击者无需知道受害者确切CSI值，仅通过观察归一化器就能估计CSI范围，利用多面体抽象域技术找到能持续降低网络吞吐量的对抗性CSI向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法存在安全漏洞，但之前研究假设攻击者能获得受害者精确CSI值，这在5G上行传输中不现实。本文旨在探索在更实际场景下，攻击者如何利用观察归一化器信息发起吞吐量降级攻击。

Method: 提出FGGM攻击方案，利用多面体抽象域技术来约束神经网络输出范围，基于观察归一化器的均值和方差估计受害者CSI的上下界，找到一组对抗性CSI向量可在整个受害者观测范围内实现攻击目标。

Result: 实验表明FGGM能确定由攻击者控制的对抗性CSI向量，在不知道受害者确切观测值的情况下，重复使用这些CSI可将受害者网络吞吐量降低高达70%。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了DRL策略中观察归一化器带来的安全风险，FGGM攻击方法可作为案例研究应用于其他DRL问题，如背包资源分配问题。

Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance
spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral
efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to
selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is
NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal
solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.
This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit
unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing
studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact
values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink
transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an
observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to
improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based
solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by
leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of
a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of
intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the
whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate
that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by
adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce
the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value
of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be
applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource
allocation problems.

*Mathis Engelbart,Mike Kosek,Lars Eggert,Jörg Ott*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于发布-订阅模式的DNS变体，使用Media-over-QUIC架构来实现资源记录的主动推送更新，相比传统DNS能显著减少更新延迟和流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNS设计为静态目录服务，资源记录变更不频繁。但现代使用场景如负载均衡和服务发现需要更实时的记录更新机制，基于请求-缓存的传统模式已不适用。

Method: 设计基于Media-over-QUIC架构的发布-订阅DNS系统原型，实现资源记录的主动推送更新机制，所有对特定记录感兴趣的解耦器都能及时收到更新。

Result: 原型实现表明发布-订阅DNS能显著减少更新流量，并大幅缩短解耦器获取最新记录版本的时间，支持内容分发网络中的负载均衡等用例。

Conclusion: DNS确实能从发布-订阅变体中获益，但该架构也带来新挑战，包括端点因额外状态管理而产生更高开销，以及首次查找时因会话建立延迟导致的查询延迟增加。

Abstract: The DNS is a key component of the Internet. Originally designed to facilitate
the resolution of host names to IP addresses, its scope has continuously
expanded over the years, today covering use cases such as load balancing or
service discovery. While DNS was initially conceived as a rather static
directory service in which resource records (RR) only change rarely, we have
seen a number of use cases over the years where a DNS flavor that isn't purely
based upon requesting and caching RRs, but rather on an active distribution of
updates for all resolvers that showed interest in the respective records in the
past, would be preferable. In this paper, we thus explore a publish-subscribe
variant of DNS based on the Media-over-QUIC architecture, where we devise a
strawman system and protocol proposal to enable pushing RR updates. We provide
a prototype implementation, finding that DNS can benefit from a
publish-subscribe variant: next to limiting update traffic, it can considerably
reduce the time it takes for a resolver to receive the latest version of a
record, thereby supporting use cases such as load balancing in content
distribution networks. The publish-subscribe architecture also brings new
challenges to the DNS, including a higher overhead for endpoints due to
additional state management, and increased query latencies on first lookup, due
to session establishment latencies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合计算资源分配和任务卸载方法(JCRATOA)，通过凸优化、契约理论和双边匹配来解决车载雾计算中的延迟最小化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载雾计算(VFC)面临资源受限和信息不对称的挑战，RSU资源有限且车辆不愿共享私有信息，导致资源分配效率低下和性能下降。

Method: 采用分层VFC架构，提出JCRATOA方法：使用凸优化进行RSU资源分配，契约理论激励FV资源分配，双边匹配游戏进行任务卸载。

Result: 仿真结果表明，JCRATOA在任务完成延迟、完成率、系统吞吐量和资源利用公平性方面表现优越，并能有效满足约束条件。

Conclusion: 所提出的JCRATOA方法能够有效解决车载雾计算中的资源分配和任务卸载问题，实现延迟最小化和性能优化。

Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising paradigm, which
leverages the idle computational resources of nearby fog vehicles (FVs) to
complement the computing capabilities of conventional vehicular edge computing.
However, utilizing VFC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive
requirements of the FVs poses several challenges. First, the limited resources
of road side units (RSUs) struggle to accommodate the growing and diverse
demands of vehicles. This limitation is further exacerbated by the information
asymmetry between the controller and FVs due to the reluctance of FVs to
disclose private information and to share resources voluntarily. This
information asymmetry hinders the efficient resource allocation and
coordination. Second, the heterogeneity in task requirements and the varying
capabilities of RSUs and FVs complicate efficient task offloading, thereby
resulting in inefficient resource utilization and potential performance
degradation. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical VFC
architecture that incorporates the computing capabilities of both RSUs and FVs.
Then, we formulate a delay minimization optimization problem (DMOP), which is
an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve the DMOP, we
propose a joint computing resource allocation and task offloading approach
(JCRATOA). Specifically, we propose a convex optimization-based method for RSU
resource allocation and a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for FV
resource allocation. Moreover, we present a two-sided matching method for task
offloading by employing the matching game. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed JCRATOA is able to achieve superior performances in task
completion delay, task completion ratio, system throughput, and resource
utilization fairness, while effectively meeting the satisfying constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRAM用于存储ML模型时，周期性刷新在待机期间造成大量能源浪费，这对资源受限的IoT设备尤其重要。

Method: 采用无线内存激活和无线内存近似两种方法，基于ML模型使用时序和相关性来优化内存管理。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在满足检索精度约束的同时，能实现比常开方法更低的能耗。

Conclusion: 所提出的无线内存管理方法能有效降低IoT设备中DRAM的能耗，同时保持ML推理性能。

Abstract: The use of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) for storing Machine Learning
(ML) models plays a critical role in accelerating ML inference tasks in the
next generation of communication systems. However, periodic refreshment of DRAM
results in wasteful energy consumption during standby periods, which is
significant for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve
this problem, this work advocates two novel approaches: 1) wireless memory
activation and 2) wireless memory approximation. These enable the wireless
devices to efficiently manage the available memory by considering the timing
aspects and relevance of ML model usage; hence, reducing the overall energy
consumption. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can realize
smaller energy consumption than the always-on approach while satisfying the
retrieval accuracy constraint.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种低空无人机载移动天线增强传输系统，联合无线能量传输和隐蔽通信，通过无线能量信号作为自然掩护，同时为物联网节点补充能量并与隐蔽用户建立传输链路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络的发展对可持续能源解决方案提出了迫切需求，特别是针对电池受限的分布式物联网节点。虽然配备无线能量传输能力的低空无人机提供了有前景的解决方案，但视线信道在实现高效能量传输的同时也暴露了敏感操作数据给对手。

Method: 提出了一种基于专家混合增强软演员-评论家（MoE-SAC）算法，采用稀疏Top-K门控浅层专家混合架构来表示由冲突优化目标产生的多模态策略分布，并包含一个显式强制执行每时隙功率预算约束和天线位置约束的动作投影模块。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够同时优化能量收集、隐蔽通信速率和无人机推进能量消耗的综合解决方案，为物联网网络的可持续和安全运行提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has created an urgent
need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly for the battery-constrained
spatially distributed IoT nodes. While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles
(UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a
promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy
delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper
proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission
system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs
energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a
covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the
total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user,
while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To
address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose
a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that
employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to
represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting
optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that
explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position
constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art
deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

### [182] [Internal Vulnerabilities, External Threats: A Grounded Framework for Enterprise Open Source Risk Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25882)
*Wenhao Yang,Minghui Zhou,Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar,Yehui Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个开源风险治理框架OTVM，通过"目标->威胁->漏洞->缓解"的逻辑链，帮助企业从战术风险管理转向整体风险治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业开源使用已从战术采用发展为战略深度集成，面临超出代码的复杂风险，传统技术工具导向的风险管理无法应对系统性威胁，存在治理盲区。

Method: 通过扎根理论研究，访谈15位从业者，开发了基于"外部威胁+内部漏洞"风险原则的整体风险治理框架，并通过三位行业专家的回顾性案例研究验证。

Result: 建立了包含战略目标矩阵、外部威胁和内部漏洞双重分类法、以及可操作缓解框架的完整治理体系，提供了从被动"灭火"到主动构建组织"免疫系统"的路径。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业提供了新的诊断视角和系统化路径，能够帮助组织从战术风险管理转向整体风险治理，填补了开源治理的空白。

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

TL;DR: PRISM是一个将大语言模型与模型驱动工程相结合的框架，用于生成符合监管要求的工件和机器可验证的安全合规证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全和合规关键领域，需要生成符合监管要求的工件并提供可验证的证据，传统方法往往依赖大量人工干预且难以保证合规性。

Method: PRISM通过三个支柱实现：统一元模型整合异构模式和监管文本；集成约束模型将结构语义要求编译为执行工件；约束引导的可验证生成应用两层执行机制。

Result: 在汽车软件工程和跨境法律管辖领域的评估显示，PRISM能生成结构有效、可审计的工件，显著减少人工修复工作量。

Conclusion: PRISM为自动化工件生成提供了内置保证的实用路径，能够与现有工具集成并提高合规效率。

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

predicting deadline compliance, illustrating the value of integrating process
mining with machine learning for proactive software project management.

TL;DR: LLMs在函数级代码生成表现良好，但在真实软件项目的类级实现中正确率显著下降（从84-89%降至25-34%），检索增强生成在部分文档情况下最有效，错误分析显示类型和属性错误是主要失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在真实软件项目中生成类级代码的能力，了解其在生产环境中的实际表现和局限性。

Method: 使用来自开源仓库的真实世界类构建基准测试，分为已见和未见分区，评估不同输入规范、检索增强配置和文档完整性水平下的LLM表现。

Result: LLMs在真实世界类任务中正确率仅为25-34%，远低于合成基准的84-89%；检索增强在部分文档情况下能提升4-7%正确率；主要错误类型为AttributeError、TypeError和AssertionError（占84%）。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在类级工程方面存在严重局限性，需要改进上下文建模、文档策略和检索集成以提升生产代码辅助工具的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共享静态字段分析的方法来优先处理潜在的顺序依赖测试，以减少测试重运行次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序依赖测试会导致CI流水线失败，现有检测方法需要多次重运行测试，效率低下，需要优先处理潜在OD测试来减少重运行

Method: 通过分析测试类中的共享静态字段来识别更可能具有顺序依赖性的测试

Result: 在27个项目模块的实验中，成功在23个案例中优先处理了所有OD测试，平均减少测试执行65.92%，减少不必要重运行72.19%

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低执行成本显著提高了OD测试检测效率

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了框架指导与行业特定需求之间的差距，强调需要采用集成、情境感知的方法来保护关键基础设施免受软件供应链风险。

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

Conclusion: 通过严谨的多循环过程和跨团队验证，为分析GenAI如何影响软件工程提供了透明可复现的基础，并基于发现提出了2030年软件工程的十大预测。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

TL;DR: RepoSearch-R1是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的强化学习框架，用于解决仓库级软件工程任务中的代码导航和信息提取问题，无需模型蒸馏或外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：无训练方法难以有效指导工具使用和决策，基于训练的方法依赖昂贵的大模型蒸馏且存在数据合规问题。

Method: 提出RepoSearch-R1框架，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索驱动智能体通过自训练生成多样化的高质量推理轨迹，构建专门用于仓库问答任务的RepoQA-Agent。

Result: 在仓库问答任务上，RepoSearch-R1相比无检索方法提升16.0%答案完整性，相比迭代检索方法提升19.5%，训练效率比通用强化学习方法提高33%。

Conclusion: 冷启动训练方法消除了数据合规问题，同时在仓库级推理任务中保持了强大的探索多样性和答案完整性。

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

### [190] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了GitHub Actions CI/CD服务的碳足迹和水足迹，基于220万个工作流运行数据，发现其环境足迹相当可观，并提出了通过减少计算资源浪费来缓解影响的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云计算环境影响的增长，了解CI/CD服务的碳足迹和水足迹变得越来越重要，但CI服务提供商通常不披露此类信息。

Method: 基于Cloud Carbon Footprint框架的方法论，使用文献中最大的工作流运行数据集，包含超过220万个工作流运行和18,000多个代码库。

Result: GitHub Actions生态系统产生显著的环境足迹：最可能情景下碳足迹为456.9 MTCO2e，水足迹为5,738.2千升。这相当于7,615棵城市树木一年的碳吸收量，或一个美国家庭5,053年的用水量。

Conclusion: 建议通过在法国和英国等环境影响较低的地区部署运行器、实施更严格的定时运行停用政策、在区域能源结构更环保时执行，以及减小代码库大小来减少计算资源浪费。

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

TL;DR: Nexus是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过专业智能体的协作审议、验证和迭代自优化来生成测试预言，显著提升了测试预言准确性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非回归测试中测试预言生成的长期挑战，目标是生成能够准确判断被测函数行为的测试预言。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含四个体现不同测试理念的专业智能体进行协作审议，然后通过生成候选实现并在安全沙箱中执行验证，失败时启动自动自优化循环来调试和修正预言。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试中，Nexus始终显著优于最先进基线方法。例如，在LiveCodeBench上将GPT-4.1-Mini的测试级预言准确率从46.30%提升到57.73%，在HumanEval上错误检测率从90.91%提升到95.45%，自动程序修复成功率从35.23%提升到69.32%。

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过多智能体协作和迭代自优化，有效解决了测试预言生成问题，显著提升了预言准确性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Motivation: 约束Horn子句（CHCs）被广泛用作各种验证任务的中间表示，包括安全检查、不变量合成和过程间分析。作者希望利用成熟的软件验证工具来解决CHC基准测试。

Method: 开发了CHCVERIF，一个基于组合方法的CHC求解器，采用软件验证方法来解决CHCs，能够重用成熟的软件验证工具处理CHC基准测试。

Result: 在线性整数算术方面取得中等成功，在位向量基准测试中取得适度成功。结果表明使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端具有可行性和潜力。

Conclusion: 当得到精心构建的组合方法支持时，使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端是可行且有潜力的方法。

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureReviewer是一个专门用于增强LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力的新方法，通过构建安全代码审查数据集、安全感知微调策略、RAG技术集成和新的SecureBLEU评估指标，显著提升了安全问题的检测准确性和审查评论质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法主要关注通用代码审查，在识别和解决安全相关问题方面的有效性尚未充分探索，且面临数据稀缺和评估指标不足的挑战。

Method: 构建专门的安全代码审查数据集，采用安全感知微调策略对LLM进行微调，集成RAG技术以减少幻觉并提高输出可靠性，引入SecureBLEU评估指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，SecureReviewer在安全问题的检测准确性和生成的审查评论的整体质量及实用性方面均优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SecureReviewer通过专门的数据集、微调策略、RAG技术和评估指标，有效提升了LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

TL;DR: 本文评估了5个开源LLM在Python代码提取方法重构任务上的表现，发现RCI提示策略优于单次提示，Deepseek-Coder-RCI和Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI表现最佳，开发者调查显示70%以上的重构结果被接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化提取方法重构（EMR）对于提高代码可读性和可维护性很重要，但目前仍主要依赖手动操作。开源LLM的出现为自动化此类高级任务提供了新方法。

Method: 系统性评估5个参数规模3B-8B的开源LLM，使用自动指标评估功能正确性和代码质量，比较单次提示与递归批评改进（RCI）提示策略的效果。

Result: RCI提示策略在测试通过率和重构质量上持续优于单次提示。最佳模型Deepseek-Coder-RCI和Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI分别达到0.829和0.808的测试通过率，将每方法代码行数从12.103降至6.192和5.577，圈复杂度从4.602降至3.453和3.294。开发者调查显示70%以上接受RCI生成的重构结果。

Conclusion: 基于质量提示的自动化重构具有明显优势，但传统指标与人工判断存在差异，需要人工参与评估。开源基准为未来LLM自动化重构研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

Method: 构建自动化数据生成管道，使用LLM生成多样化指令，应用相应的代码修改，并进行视觉验证以确保正确性，创建名为Instruct4Edit的高质量微调数据集。

Result: 通过在Instruct4Edit上微调模型，在将人类意图转化为精确、结构连贯且视觉准确的代码更改方面实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: 为基于自然语言的网页编辑提供了可扩展和透明的基础，证明微调较小的开源模型可以达到与专有系统相竞争的性能。

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

Conclusion: 提出的在线交互式贝叶斯推断调试方法有效解决了概率编程调试困难的问题，使贝叶斯推断技术更易于使用。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

Motivation: 现有调试方法直接展示正确程序给学习者，虽然能修复错误但削弱了问题解决能力的培养。需要一种更有效的教学反馈方式。

Method: 系统包含Diff-Analyze模块，对比学生项目与参考实现，识别关键差异，使用大语言模型解释差异重要性。学习者通过自定义渲染引擎检查高亮积木，理解解释并选择性应用部分修复，迭代直至实现预期功能。

Result: 实证研究表明，Stitch相比最先进的自动化Scratch反馈生成工具，提供了更有效的学习体验。逐步辅导显著提升学习效果，优于直接答案方法和当前自动化反馈工具。

Conclusion: 直接展示正确答案在教学中效果不佳，而交互式、逐步指导的系统能促进更有效的学习。在积木编程中，什么构成有效反馈仍是一个开放问题，但逐步辅导被证明能显著提升学习成果。

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析ImageMagick项目的76个漏洞重新引入案例，发现过程指标（如问题腐败度和问题密度）与漏洞重新引入密切相关，强调漏洞重新引入是累积开发活动和社会技术条件的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞即使在修复后仍会持续存在或重新出现，现有研究很少探索过程指标是否能揭示随时间推移的风险开发活动，这对于预测和缓解软件漏洞至关重要。

Method: 在ImageMagick项目上进行案例研究，将纵向过程指标（如总线因子、问题密度、问题腐败度）与漏洞重新引入活动相关联，分析提交级别的安全修复，关注漏洞演化和重新出现的较长变更序列。

Result: 研究发现重新引入通常与增加的问题腐败度和波动的问题密度相一致，反映了问题管理和团队响应能力的短期低效。过程指标能有效揭示导致漏洞重新引入的风险开发模式。

Conclusion: 过程指标与代码指标相结合可以预测风险修复并加强软件安全，漏洞重新引入很少是孤立行动的结果，而是源于累积开发活动和社会技术条件。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

Motivation: 软件系统更新对避免技术债务和安全漏洞至关重要，但手动更新库和框架耗时且易错，需要探索LLM和智能代理系统在自动化维护任务中的应用

Method: 使用GitHub Copilot Agent Mode作为自主AI系统，在10个客户端应用数据集上执行SQLAlchemy库的多步骤迁移工作流，并引入迁移覆盖率指标评估效果

Result: LLM代理能够成功迁移SQLAlchemy版本间的功能和API使用点（迁移覆盖率中位数100%），但无法保持应用功能，导致测试通过率较低（中位数39.75%）

Conclusion: 虽然LLM代理在API迁移方面表现出色，但在保持应用功能完整性方面仍有不足，需要进一步改进以确保自动化迁移的可靠性

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日志解析是自动化日志分析的第一步，但现有解析器采用不同技术且性能各异，需要系统评估来理解其特性和表现。

Method: 通过全面的实证研究比较语法和语义日志解析器，以及单阶段和两阶段解析架构。

Result: 语义方法在模板识别上表现更好，语法解析器效率高10-1000倍且分组准确率更高。两阶段架构比单阶段准确率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的SynLog+模块作为两阶段架构的第二阶段，显著提升了语法和语义解析器的解析准确率，且几乎没有额外运行时成本。

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

### [203] [Flex-GAD : Flexible Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25809)
*Apu Chakraborty,Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Flex-GAD是一个无监督的图异常检测框架，通过社区感知的GCN编码器和属性编码器捕获图的互补信息，并使用自注意力融合机制自适应整合表示，在多个真实图数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在属性网络中检测异常节点对于识别欺诈、虚假信息等行为至关重要，现有方法在捕获图结构一致性和有效融合多源信息方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Flex-GAD框架，包含社区感知GCN编码器（建模社区内和社区间信息）、标准属性编码器，以及自注意力表示融合模块实现自适应加权整合。

Result: 在7个真实属性图上测试，平均AUC比最佳基线GAD-NR提升7.98%，训练速度比Anomaly DAE快102倍，比GAD-NR快3倍。

Conclusion: Flex-GAD在检测性能和计算效率方面均显著优于现有方法，证明了其在不同图结构上的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is
associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is
essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in
domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce
platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph
anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to
capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel
community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community
information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency,
along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are
fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables
adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This
fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node
representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven
real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute
homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the
previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and
flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces
training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per
epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SGU是针对有符号网络的专门图遗忘框架，有效解决了现有方法在处理有符号网络时的局限性，显著提升了模型性能和遗忘效率。

Abstract: The proliferation of signed networks in contemporary social media platforms
necessitates robust privacy-preserving mechanisms. Graph unlearning, which aims
to eliminate the influence of specific data points from trained models without
full retraining, becomes particularly critical in these scenarios where user
interactions are sensitive and dynamic. Existing graph unlearning methodologies
are exclusively designed for unsigned networks and fail to account for the
unique structural properties of signed graphs. Their naive application to
signed networks neglects edge sign information, leading to structural imbalance
across subgraphs and consequently degrading both model performance and
unlearning efficiency. This paper proposes SGU (Signed Graph Unlearning), a
graph unlearning framework specifically for signed networks. SGU incorporates a
new graph unlearning partition paradigm and a novel signed network partition
algorithm that preserve edge sign information during partitioning and ensure
structural balance across partitions. Compared with baselines, SGU achieves
state-of-the-art results in both model performance and unlearning efficiency.

### [205] [Simulating and Experimenting with Social Media Mobilization Using LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26494)
*Sadegh Shirani,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于代理的模拟框架，整合真实人口统计数据、Twitter网络拓扑和异质LLM代理，研究政治动员信息对选民投票率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交网络改变了政治动员信息的传播方式，需要研究大规模下的同伴影响机制。基于著名的6100万人Facebook实验，探索政治动员的新研究方法。

Method: 使用基于代理的模拟框架，整合美国人口普查数据、真实Twitter网络结构和异质LLM代理（GPT-4.1系列）。每个代理具有人口属性、政治立场和政治素养，在真实社交网络结构中互动。

Result: 模拟器重现了实地实验中的定性模式，包括社交信息处理下更强的动员效果和可测量的同伴溢出效应。

Conclusion: 该框架为政治动员研究提供了可控、可复现的环境，用于测试反事实设计和敏感性分析，在高效度实地实验和灵活计算建模之间架起桥梁。

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at
