Method: 提出MLLM引导的语义对齐模块(MGSA)，通过多模态输入整合和语义对齐损失来捕获跨模态语义关系；采用两阶段渐进式训练策略和自合成流程。

Result: UniFit不仅支持多种虚拟试穿任务（包括多服装和模型间试穿），而且达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: UniFit通过MLLM驱动的语义对齐和渐进式训练，有效解决了虚拟试穿中的语义差距和数据稀缺挑战，实现了通用且高性能的虚拟试穿框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EfficientSAM3模型系列，通过渐进式分层蒸馏方法将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级学生模型中，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3的统一架构（共享视觉骨干、DETR风格检测器、密集内存跟踪器）在设备端使用上过于沉重，需要开发高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）方法，分三个阶段：编码器蒸馏、时序内存蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行的VOS数据集上进行了基准测试，与相关工作比较，实现了强大的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3系列模型能够在保持高保真度的同时，实现在设备端进行概念分割和跟踪。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种新颖扩展来改进基于模型的6D物体姿态估计方法，包括动态非均匀密集采样、多假设推理机制、迭代优化和遮挡训练增强，在遮挡场景下显著提升精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D姿态估计方法在遮挡场景下早期检测阶段容易出错，误差在流水线中传播导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 采用动态非均匀密集采样聚焦可见区域计算、多假设推理保留多个姿态候选、迭代优化逐步提升精度、遮挡训练增强提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超过5%，BOP数据集上提升超过2%，推理速度提升约3倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了遮挡场景下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了精度和效率。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，为历史地图生成合成训练数据，解决历史地图标注数据稀缺的问题，并通过语义分割任务验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的自动化分析需要大量标注训练数据，但历史地图特别是特定制图领域的标注数据稀缺且创建成本高。合成训练数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性，难以有效支持机器学习。

Method: 通过将原始历史地图集的制图风格转移到矢量数据上，生成无限数量的合成历史地图。提出自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术来模拟历史地图扫描中的视觉不确定性和噪声。

Result: 使用生成的数据集在自构建图卷积网络上进行领域自适应语义分割，全面评估了数据引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决历史地图训练数据稀缺问题，为同质历史地图集的分析提供可行的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测快速推断箱子尺寸并使用类别CAD模板估计姿态，在保持精度的同时显著降低推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库自动化、拣选等场景中，现有方法在灵活性、精度和计算效率方面的不足：基于模型的方法需要精确CAD模型且泛化差；无模型方法在复杂条件下易失败；类别级方法过于通用且忽略环境先验。

Method: 使用单次RGB-D观测，通过快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型估计姿态，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略拒绝不合理假设。

Result: 在真实仓储场景和公开基准测试中，Box6D在保持竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度的同时，将推理时间减少了约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D为仓储场景中的箱子6D姿态估计提供了高效准确的解决方案，平衡了灵活性、精度和计算效率，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段自改进范式，通过生成文本推理来弥合视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类中的语义鸿沟，无需额外标注即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，主要由于稀疏的领域数据无法弥合复杂时空内容与抽象分类标签之间的语义距离（理性鸿沟）。

Method: 两阶段自改进方法：1）提示VLM为每个视频生成详细文本推理，迫使模型阐述领域特定逻辑；2）在自生成推理上进行微调，利用中间监督使表征与目标领域细节对齐；3）在任务标签上进行常规监督微调。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成推理作为适应VLM到领域特定视频分析的有效且标注高效的范式。

Conclusion: 自生成推理是一种有效的、标注高效的范式，能够成功地将视觉语言模型适应到领域特定的视频分析任务中。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGLL框架，通过多粒度语言学习解决CLIP在医学图像等多标签、多粒度场景下的局限性，提升视觉-文本对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法专注于单标签、单粒度对齐，但在医学成像等复杂领域中，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度注释，需要更精细的多粒度对齐方法。

Method: MGLL框架利用结构化多标签监督，整合不同粒度的文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督来增强对齐，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，可作为即插即用模块集成到视觉语言模型中。

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练，并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: MGLL有效解决了多标签和跨粒度对齐问题，在复杂视觉理解任务中表现优异，为医学图像分析等应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖2D视频，而3D超声心动图具有更好的图像质量和评估能力，但医生习惯于2D视图格式。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式规则，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式方法，从3D体积重建标准2D视图。

Result: 在来自2家医院的1600个视频中，三位心脏病专家的盲法评估达到96%准确率；提取的2D视频能够检测心脏异常并生成临床级测量。

Conclusion: 提取的2D视频保留了空间校准和诊断特征，使临床医生能够从3D体积获得准确的真实世界解释。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph是首个交互式全景视频场景图生成框架，通过单一用户提示（如点击或边界框）实现跨时间分割跟踪、自动发现交互对象并预测三元组关系，统一了视觉提示与时空语义理解。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频场景图生成系统是封闭的前馈管道，无法融入人类指导；而可提示分割模型缺乏语义和关系推理能力。需要结合两者的优势，实现可控可解释的视频场景理解。

Method: 引入动态交互发现模块生成主体条件化对象提示，以及语义分类头执行联合实体和谓词推理。从单一用户提示出发，分割跟踪主体、发现交互对象并预测三元组关系。

Result: 在OpenPVSG基准测试中，Click2Graph为用户引导的全景视频场景图生成建立了坚实基础，展示了人类提示如何与全景定位和关系推理相结合。

Conclusion: Click2Graph通过统一视觉提示与时空语义理解，实现了可控和可解释的视频场景理解，为交互式全景视频场景图生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限可见类别上微调CLIP进行分割时会导致过拟合，并破坏预训练好的视觉-语言对齐关系。

Method: 基于互信息设计两个新目标：压缩像素-文本模态对齐以减少噪声；最大化预训练CLIP与微调模型对齐知识间的互信息来迁移适合分割任务的局部语义关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛评估验证了InfoCLIP在增强CLIP微调用于开放词汇语义分割方面的有效性。

Conclusion: InfoCLIP展示了在不对称迁移中的适应性和优越性，能够稳定模态对齐并提升分割性能。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的一致性正则化方法，通过可微分的BI-RADS形态特征来缓解乳腺超声肿瘤分割与分类任务之间的破坏性干扰，显著提升了多任务学习在外部验证数据集上的分割性能。


<details>

Result: 在BrEaST数据集上训练，在三个外部数据集(UDIAT、BUSI、BUS-UCLM)上验证，分割任务Dice系数显著提升：0.81 vs 0.59、0.66 vs 0.56、0.69 vs 0.49 (p<0.001)，在UDIAT数据集上达到最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的一致性正则化方法有效缓解了多任务学习中的破坏性干扰，显著提升了乳腺超声肿瘤分割在外部验证数据集上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去偏方法依赖大量标注数据或微调，不适用于基础规模模型，需要探索轻量级、无需调优的公平性改进方案。

Method: 提出公平感知演示选择(FADS)，通过聚类采样构建人口统计学平衡且语义相关的演示，解决传统演示选择策略因人口统计不平衡导致的公平性问题。

Result: 在多个医学影像基准测试中，FADS持续减少了性别、种族和民族相关的差异，同时保持较强的准确性。

Conclusion: 公平感知上下文学习为公平医学图像推理提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图表示的方法，利用样本间关系来改进长尾分布视觉数据集中的OOD检测性能，显著降低误报率并提升尾类分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长尾分布数据集中，现有OOD检测方法存在高误报率和尾类分类准确率低的问题，需要利用样本间关系来改善这一状况。

Method: 使用预训练模型特征空间初始化图结构，通过高斯化处理激活层分布偏差，然后使用图卷积网络精炼图表示，得到适合长尾OOD检测的特征空间。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT和ImageNet-LT三个基准测试中，方法在误报率和尾类ID分类准确率方面大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 图表示方法能有效提升长尾分布数据集中的OOD检测性能，特别是在降低误报率和改善尾类分类方面表现突出。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Conclusion: MoR架构成功解决了Real-ISR中自适应捕捉异质性特征和知识共享的问题，通过稀疏MoE的集成实现了优越的超分辨率性能。

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过自适应KV缓存策略有效解决了视觉自回归模型中下一尺度预测的KV内存瓶颈，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: T2T-VICL框架有效证明了视觉语言模型具备跨任务视觉上下文学习的能力，为统一视觉语言模型解决多样化下游任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

Result: 基准测试显示即使是GPT-4o等强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假，模型无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索关联，缺乏建模他人知识、信念或意图的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了构建更具洞察力和可信度AI系统的迫切需求，提出的框架在具有挑战性的任务上实现了性能提升，为构建真正具备人类社交推理能力的MLLM指明了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

*Tianxiong Zhong,Xingye Tian,Xuebo Wang,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCS-LDM是一种新的视觉生成范式，通过构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，将信息复杂度与尺度解耦，支持固定潜在表示下任意分辨率和帧率的解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型通常将尺度与内容复杂度耦合，使用更多潜在token来表示更高分辨率图像或更高帧率视频。但视觉数据所需的潜在容量主要取决于内容复杂度，尺度仅作为上限。

Method: 构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，通过多级token建模样本复杂度，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率。通过跨层级分解结构和细节信息，支持渐进式从粗到细的生成范式。

Result: 实验结果显示DCS-LDM在提供跨不同尺度和视觉质量的灵活生成的同时，实现了与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: DCS-LDM通过解耦信息复杂度与尺度，实现了灵活的计算质量权衡，支持渐进式生成，为视觉生成提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [30] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值方法，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率帧插值中的模糊、马赛克和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于流的视频帧插值方法在低分辨率预测双向流后使用高倍率上采样，会导致流边缘模糊或马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致插值帧出现重影和不连续性。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样（GFU）和纹理映射。GFU使用输入帧作为引导来改善双线性上采样流的模糊细节；纹理映射生成中间代理帧，从输入帧选择清晰纹理块映射到代理上，通过重建模块生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验表明VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过引导流上采样和纹理映射有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的运动估计和纹理重建问题，显著提升了插值质量。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得真实图像和合成图像越来越难以区分，现有的AI生成图像检测方法在分布外泛化方面存在挑战，主要原因是训练过程中利用了虚假捷径。

Method: 提出PiN-CLIP方法，联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，通过交叉注意力融合视觉和类别语义特征构建特征空间的正激励噪声，在优化过程中注入噪声来微调视觉编码器。

Result: 在包含42种不同生成模型合成图像的开源数据集上进行了比较实验，方法实现了新的最先进性能，平均准确率比现有方法提高了5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过特征空间的正激励噪声注入，能够抑制捷径敏感方向同时放大稳定的取证线索，从而提取更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示，有效解决了AI生成图像检测的泛化问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩视频质量增强的盲方法，包括预训练的退化表示学习模块和分层终止机制，解决了现有方法依赖已知QP和缺乏空间细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中量化参数(QP)可能未知，限制了现有非盲方法的适用性。现有盲方法仅捕获全局退化信息，缺乏空间细节，且未考虑不同压缩级别的计算需求差异。

Method: 预训练的退化表示学习(DRL)模块提取高维多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除；分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的数量。

Result: 在QP=22时，PSNR比现有最先进盲方法提升110%(从0.31dB到0.65dB)；分层终止机制在QP=22时的平均推理时间比QP=42减少一半。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了盲压缩视频质量增强的性能，同时通过动态计算调整提高了效率。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Motivation: 处理长视频需要高效的模型架构和有效的长时序上下文处理机制。研究发现视觉到文本的信息聚合现象导致视觉令牌冗余。

Method: 采用混合Mamba-Transformer骨干网络，结合状态空间模型的效率和注意力机制的表达能力。提出TransV令牌信息传输模块，将视觉令牌压缩到指令令牌中。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba-Transformer架构的初步步骤，为混合模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D目标检测器在训练和评估之间存在差距，训练时缺乏空间可靠性和排序感知，而推理时使用基于排序的预测选择，这种不匹配限制了模型学习与推理行为对齐的表征能力。

Method: SR3D包含两个核心组件：1）空间优先最优传输分配，动态强调位置良好和空间可靠的样本；2）秩感知自适应自蒸馏方案，通过自蒸馏范式自适应地注入排序感知。

Conclusion: SR3D框架通过解决训练-推理不一致性问题，显著提升了室内点云3D目标检测的性能，证明了空间可靠性和排序感知在训练中的重要性。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Motivation: 现有生存分析方法缺乏临床所需的透明度，且病理智能体在生存预测中存在三个局限：无法整合多模态数据、无效的感兴趣区域探索、未能利用历史病例的经验学习。

Method: 两阶段方法：(1) WSI-基因CoT增强病例库构建：通过低倍镜筛查、跨模态相似性感知补丁挖掘等分析病理图像，基因分层分析处理六类功能基因；(2) 二分法多专家智能体推理：通过RAG检索相似病例，整合多模态报告进行渐进区间细化。

Result: 在五个TCGA队列上的广泛实验表明，SurvAgent优于传统方法、专有MLLM和医疗智能体。

Conclusion: 为精准肿瘤学中可解释AI驱动的生存预测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Motivation: 现有高空间分辨率水体变化检测数据集稀缺，且传统深度学习方法未能充分利用深度特征中的空间语义和结构信息。

Method: 设计了SSCP注意力模块，包含多语义空间注意力(MSA)、结构关系感知全局注意力(SRGA)和通道自注意力(CSA)三个组件，可即插即用到现有WBCD模型中。

Result: 在提出的HSRW-CD和Water-CD数据集上的大量实验验证了SSCP的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和SSCP模块显著提升了水体变化检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Result: 动态交互产生更具上下文感知和语义丰富的视觉输出。

Conclusion: 这项工作为交织文本推理以增强视觉生成的研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功解决了3DGS SLAM中语言特征集成的问题，为机器人高级交互提供了实时、紧凑的开放词汇语义映射能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Result: 在MMEB基准上，推理引导的条件化使多模态检索性能比非推理基线提升4.9%

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效增强嵌入质量，将推理过程融入嵌入提取是提升多模态表示的有效方法

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: Simba框架通过分布学习方法有效解决了点云补全中的过拟合和噪声敏感问题，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 提出LNG-SWR方法，通过层间噪声引导的选择性小波重建来提升医学图像分割模型的鲁棒性，无需牺牲干净样本性能，可单独使用或与对抗训练结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在临床部署中需要保持对分布偏移和扰动的稳定性。对抗训练虽然能提高鲁棒性，但存在干净-鲁棒性权衡问题以及高训练/调优成本，限制了在医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: 在训练期间向多个层注入小幅度零均值噪声，学习频率偏置先验，使表示远离噪声敏感方向。然后对输入/特征分支应用先验引导的选择性小波重建，实现频率自适应：抑制噪声敏感频带，增强方向性结构和形状线索，稳定边界响应，同时保持频谱一致性。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，在PGD-L∞/L2和SSAH攻击下，LNG-SWR在干净Dice/IoU上取得一致增益，并显著减少强攻击下的性能下降。与对抗训练结合时获得叠加增益，且不牺牲干净精度。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割在对抗性和标准训练机制中提供了一条简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性路径，具有低推理开销和骨干网络无关性。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的冗长文本诱导攻击(VTIA)，通过两阶段框架在良性图像中注入难以察觉的对抗性扰动，以最大化视觉语言模型的输出token长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态任务上的成功，其部署效率问题日益突出。现有方法仅延迟EOS token的出现来隐式延长输出，缺乏稳定性和可控性，无法直接最大化输出token长度作为显式优化目标。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 对抗性提示搜索，使用强化学习策略自动识别能诱导LLM产生冗长输出的对抗性提示；2) 视觉对齐扰动优化，在输入图像上构建对抗样本，最大化扰动图像视觉嵌入与对抗性提示嵌入的相似度。

Result: 在四种流行视觉语言模型上的综合实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和泛化能力方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出的VTIA攻击能够有效诱导视觉语言模型产生冗长输出，增加了能耗、延迟和token成本，揭示了模型在部署安全方面的新漏洞。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA是一个自监督的视觉语言动作框架，通过阶段对齐奖励、基于姿态的对象探索和长时程记忆三个组件，解决了VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中的阶段幻觉问题，显著提升了任务成功率和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中存在阶段幻觉问题，即智能体利用粗糙的评估信号来走捷径完成多步任务，报告高进度但未真正完成任务。

Method: 1) 阶段对齐奖励(SAR)：使用三元组对比学习和Gemini生成的困难负样本来防止视觉捷径；2) 基于姿态的对象探索(POE)：基于相对对象-夹爪姿态而非原始像素来建立好奇心；3) 长时程记忆：使用选择性上下文保留和门控融合来稳定扩展推演过程中的内在塑造。

Result: 在Discoverse-L长时程操作基准测试中，EvoVLA将平均任务成功率提升了10.2个百分点，达到69.2%，样本效率提高1.5倍，阶段幻觉从38.5%降低到14.8%。在真实机器人部署中，平均成功率达到54.6%，比OpenVLA-OFT高出11个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLA有效解决了VLA模型的阶段幻觉问题，实现了从仿真到真实世界的有效迁移和强泛化能力，在长时程机器人操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法很少从可解释性机制角度研究CLIP在密集预测中的性能边界。研究发现CLIP类似于人类分心，会将大量注意力资源从目标区域转移到无关token上。

Method: 提出RF-CLIP训练自由方法，通过识别和过滤维度特异性过度激活产生的干扰token，将注意力重新聚焦到目标区域，从而改进CLIP的多模态对齐粒度。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持高推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力重新聚焦行为，可以有效提升CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的密集预测能力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VLA模型直接预测高维视觉状态会分散模型容量且训练成本高，压缩视觉状态又会导致信息瓶颈，同时忽视语言监督导致理解和推理能力不足。

Method: 提出Mantis框架，采用解耦视觉预测(DVF)，通过元查询和扩散Transformer头将视觉预测与主干网络分离，使用残差连接提供当前视觉状态，通过简单的下一状态预测目标让元查询自动捕捉潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中微调后达到96.7%成功率，超越强基线并展现高收敛速度；实际评估中在指令跟随、泛化到未见指令和推理能力方面优于π0.5模型。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效减轻了VLA主干负担，使其能够通过语言监督保持理解和推理能力，在机器人操作任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公开数据集上表现良好，但由于公开数据与现实数据存在差异，在实际应用中效果不佳，需要解决无监督域自适应问题。

Method: 设计了两阶段模型DSLGA：预训练阶段使用域共享学习策略(DSLS)缓解跨域模态差异；微调阶段使用渐进对齐策略(GAS)通过簇到整体的方式处理跨模态对齐挑战。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种设置下显著优于现有的VI-ReID域自适应方法，甚至超过一些监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的DSLGA模型有效解决了UDA-VI-ReID中的跨域和跨模态挑战，构建了新的测试方法CMDA-XD，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言动作模型在具身环境中取得了显著进展，但其对抗鲁棒性在真实多模态和黑盒条件下仍未被充分探索，现有研究主要关注单模态扰动而忽视了影响具身推理和决策的跨模态错位问题。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中使用微调的OpenVLA模型进行实验，结果表明即使轻微的多模态扰动也会导致显著的行为偏差，揭示了具身多模态对齐的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了具身视觉语言动作模型在多模态对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了在真实部署中考虑多模态鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: ICCE方法显著缩小了无监督方法与有监督方法之间的性能差距，证明了聚类集成策略在无监督图像分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Abstract: We present a fast, spatio-temporal scene understanding framework based on Vision Gated Generative Transformers (VGGT). The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs是一个针对移动GPU优化的3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)实现，通过新颖的排序算法和内存优化，在移动设备上实现了4.1倍排序加速和1.7倍整体加速，同时减少1.6倍内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将3DGS部署到移动设备具有数据隐私、离线操作和更快响应等优势，但移动GPU的二维纹理缓存优化是关键挑战。

Method: 开发了针对2D内存优化的新型排序算法，改进了变量布局设计，并应用其他优化来加速3DGS算法的各个步骤。

Result: 端到端评估显示，Texture3dgs在排序方面实现了4.1倍加速，整体3D场景重建实现了1.7倍加速，同时内存使用减少了1.6倍。

Conclusion: Texture3dgs的设计有效地实现了高效的移动3D场景重建，证明了其优化策略在移动平台上的有效性。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在下游任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其表示通常被下采样14x/16x，限制了在像素级应用中的直接使用。现有特征上采样方法依赖数据集特定的重新训练或沉重的隐式优化，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建，具有良好的跨架构和跨模态迁移能力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Conclusion: 该工作将SAE定位为跨模态大规模主题分析的有效工具，为理解SAE提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: NaTex通过原生3D纹理生成方法有效解决了传统2D多视图方法的局限性，在纹理质量和应用灵活性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO通过有效利用语义信息和多尺度特征表示，显著提升了遥感建筑变化检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Motivation: 现实场景中由于硬件限制和校准漂移，RGB-D数据往往存在不对齐问题，导致现有方法性能下降。

Result: 在广泛实验中，MOMNet实现了最先进的性能，并表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MOMNet能够有效处理不对齐的RGB-D数据，为现实场景中的深度超分辨率提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios.

TL;DR: CAMS提出了一种基于CLIP的组合零样本学习方法，通过门控交叉注意力机制和多空间解缠来提升对未见属性-对象组合的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的CZSL方法主要依赖图像编码器获得的全局语义表示，但该表示能力有限，无法完全解缠属性和对象语义。

Method: 设计门控交叉注意力机制从CLIP高层图像编码块中捕获细粒度语义特征，并通过多空间解缠实现属性和对象语义的分离。

Result: 在MIT-States、UT-Zappos和C-GQA三个基准测试上，CAMS在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMS通过语义特征提取和多空间解缠有效提升了组合零样本学习的性能，证明了该方法在属性和对象语义解缠方面的有效性。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标记点的光学运动捕捉系统存在准备时间长、标记点识别模糊等问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 引入刚性体标记点(RBM)作为新数据模态，开发基于深度学习的回归模型，使用测地线损失直接估计SMPL参数。

Result: 端到端模型在AMASS数据集上达到最先进的姿态估计精度，计算量比优化方法减少一个数量级，实际Vicon系统验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 稀疏6自由度RBM结合流形感知测地线损失为图形学、虚拟现实和生物力学提供了实用且高保真的实时运动捕捉解决方案。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Motivation: 现有的自监督环视深度估计方法在重叠图像区域存在深度估计不一致的问题，需要解决多摄像头系统下的跨视图一致性挑战。

Method: 首先为每个图像预测初始深度图，将所有图像的3D点投影到共享单位圆柱体上建立跨图像邻域关系，生成位置映射图，然后应用显式的非学习空间注意力机制根据圆柱体上的距离聚合跨图像特征，最终预测每个图像的深度图。

Conclusion: 提出的几何引导方法能够有效解决多摄像头系统中的深度估计一致性问题，为环视3D感知提供了密集、度量和跨视图一致的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Motivation: 由于视觉表示的类内变化，从支持图像中提取的元信息无法为未训练类别提供准确的分割指导。作者认为支持图像提供的参考可能不是必需的，关键在于为训练和未训练类别提供无偏的元指导。

Result: 实验表明，该方法明显优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用目标属性语言描述构建稳健的支持策略，可以有效解决少样本分割中的类内变化问题，提升分割性能。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现有垃圾检测数据集缺乏对垃圾容器监控的专门标注，且多为静态环境数据，无法满足智能城市垃圾管理中的实际物流需求。

Method: 构建了包含垃圾和垃圾容器的城市场景数据集，为三个任务提供基准模型，并提出两种改进策略：基于启发式的垃圾容器跟踪方法和利用几何先验的模型无关分割框架。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在垃圾容器检测上表现良好，但基线跟踪方法计数误差较大；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低79.6%；几何感知策略在轻量级模型上将分割mAP@0.5提升27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的实际感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，证明了多模态输入在此任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner是一种针对视觉-语言-动作模型的双层级token剪枝方法，通过结合语义级和动作级重要性标准，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM token剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择token，忽视了VLA模型的双系统特性（高层语义理解和低层动作执行），导致动作生成所需的关键信息被丢弃，严重影响VLA性能。

Method: 提出双层级重要性标准：视觉语言预填充注意力用于语义相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作重要性。基于此标准设计自适应双层级token选择策略，在计算预算内保留紧凑且信息丰富的视觉token。

Result: 实验表明VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和机器人任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner是一种通用即插即用的VLA专用token剪枝方法，有效解决了VLA模型实时部署的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: LLaVA³通过多视角2D图像有效提升了3D场景理解能力，无需额外的3D训练数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 尽管通用视频预测模型在标准场景中表现良好，但遮挡仍然是视频预测中的固有挑战。作者假设通过提供明确的运动信息（点流）和几何结构信息（深度图）能够改善模型在遮挡和背景运动情况下的预测性能。

Method: 使用标准的多对象潜在变换器架构进行未来帧预测，但修改该架构以融入深度和点流信息。在合成和真实世界数据集上进行受控评估，不仅使用基于外观的指标，还使用对象掩码上的Wasserstein距离来有效测量预测的运动分布。

Conclusion: 点流和深度信息的引入能够显著提升视频预测模型在遮挡场景下的性能，特别是在处理背景运动方面表现出明显优势。

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Conclusion: 通过利用图像采集时间信息来调制模型特征，可以有效改善乳腺DCE-MRI肿瘤分割的准确性和泛化性。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

The dataset comprises 6,915 high-quality punch clips categorized into six distinct punch types, extracted from 20 publicly available YouTube sparring sessions and involving 18 different athletes. Each clip is manually segmented and labeled to ensure precise temporal boundaries and class consistency, capturing a wide range of motion styles, camera angles, and athlete physiques. This dataset is specifically curated to support research in real-time vision-based action recognition, especially in low-resource and unconstrained environments. By providing a rich benchmark with diverse punch examples, this contribution aims to accelerate progress in movement analysis, automated coaching, and performance assessment within boxing and related domains.

TL;DR: SemCLIP提出了一种新的CLIP对比损失函数，通过结合释义和否定来增强视觉-语言模型的语义鲁棒性，在保持CLIP性能的同时显著提高对否定文本的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在否定和释义文本上表现不一致，否定会以最小词汇变化彻底改变含义，而释义会产生不同表达但相同含义的文本，这对视觉-语言模型的对齐和评估提出了挑战。

Method: 提出SemCLIP方法，结合释义和否定，设计新的对比损失函数，并使用LLM生成的包含原始、释义和否定文本描述的训练三元组来训练CLIP类模型。

Result: 在CC-Neg基准测试中，原始图像检索准确率从68.1%提升到78.1%；在Sugarcrepe++基准上表现混合但优于仅使用否定训练的模型；在零样本分类任务中全面优于CLIP。

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够显著提高对语义变换的鲁棒性，特别是在处理否定文本方面表现出色，同时保持原有性能。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: 提出一种鲁棒的多摄像头体操运动员跟踪方法，通过结合体操领域知识，在检测不足时使用射线-平面相交生成共面3D轨迹候选，成功应用于国际体操锦标赛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：场地空间限制导致摄像头数量有限，光照、背景、服装变化和遮挡导致多视角检测可能失效，传统多摄像头三角测量难以准确确定3D轨迹。

Method: 提出级联数据关联范式：当交叉视角检测充足时使用三角测量生成3D轨迹候选，检测不足时采用射线-平面相交方法生成共面3D轨迹候选，利用体操运动员3D中心通常在预定义垂直平面内的领域知识。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中优于现有方法。该跟踪方法已成功应用于最近的体操世锦赛，获得国际体操联合会的高度认可。

Conclusion: 通过将体操领域知识融入跟踪解决方案，提出的级联数据关联方法能够有效补偿不确定轨迹，最小化跟踪失败，为体操裁判系统提供了可靠的跟踪支持。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的合成图像检测框架，通过对比学习提取特征嵌入，结合k-NN分类器实现少样本学习，显著提升检测准确率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致合成图像难以与真实内容区分，传统检测方法因需要频繁重新训练而计算成本高昂且不实用。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征嵌入；第二阶段使用k-NN分类器在嵌入空间进行少样本学习。

Result: 在少样本学习（每类仅150张图像）下达到91.3%的平均检测准确率，比现有方法提升5.2个百分点；在源归属任务中AUC和OSCR分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为适应快速演进的生成AI环境提供了强大、可扩展的取证归属系统，无需大量重新训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant通过尺度-深度不对称依赖观察，提出在VAR模型中采用权重共享的子网络架构，早期尺度使用完整网络，后期尺度使用子网络，显著降低内存消耗和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型的多尺度渐进生成导致累积KV缓存带来巨大内存开销，限制了实际部署。研究发现VAR模型存在尺度-深度不对称依赖：早期尺度对网络深度极其敏感，而后期尺度对深度减少保持稳健。

Method: 从30层VAR-d30网络中通过等距采样选择多个子网络（16层到2层），早期尺度由完整网络处理，后期尺度使用子网络。子网络与完整网络共享权重，实现单一模型内的灵活深度调整。采用渐进训练策略解决权重共享带来的优化冲突。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8达到接近原始VAR-d30的质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），同时减少40-65%内存消耗。VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量适度下降（FID 2.97）。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选项，满足多样化应用场景需求。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了长尾目标检测性能，特别是在稀有类别上的表现，证明了这些方法在解决类别不平衡问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Motivation: 医学分割网络需要选择性移除知识以满足隐私合规、伦理部署和数据集持续修订的需求。

Method: 使用教师-学生蒸馏范式，通过LoRA约束的子空间更新，在低秩解码器空间中移除特定病变或类别的表示，同时保留全局解剖理解。包含强遗忘阶段和温和恢复阶段。

Result: 在ISIC分割中，遗忘集IoU从0.875降至0.509，同时保留集和验证集性能保持竞争力；在ISIC分类中，遗忘集准确率从87.0%降至64.1%，保留集准确率从83.9%提升至90.6%。

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了负责任、可控且可逆的遗忘途径，使模型能够忘记敏感样本或结构，同时保留重要性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的教师引导剪枝框架，将知识蒸馏与重要性分数估计紧密结合，实现一次性全局剪枝，在多个图像分类基准测试中实现了高稀疏度且性能损失最小。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet等基准测试中，该方法在高稀疏度水平下优于EPG和EPSD等最先进基线方法，同时比COLT等迭代剪枝方案计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个计算效率高、性能保持的解决方案，非常适合在资源受限的环境中部署。

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: SAM2S通过专门设计的手术iVOS增强，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了分割准确性和泛化能力，为手术视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be released at https://jinlab-imvr.github.io/SAM2S.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统引导图像方法在低光图像上效果不佳，因为低光图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够的特征用于引导传输

Method: 基于多参数优化，从少量样本图像对中学习低光与明亮图像特征之间的关联，使用机器学习方法学习这些特征

Result: AGU能够使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像，在低光场景下优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: AGU方法有效解决了低光图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Conclusion: TRIM在不影响输出质量的前提下，有效加速了3D高斯扩散模型的推理过程，同时支持推理时缩放。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S声称通过空间超感知改进视频世界模型，但本文分析发现其基准测试存在缺陷，提出的推理方法利用了基准中的捷径而非真正的空间认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑Cambrian-S提出的空间超感知能力评估方法的有效性，检验其基准测试是否真正衡量了空间认知能力。

Method: 引入简单的NoSense基线方法（仅使用词袋SigLIP模型），并在VSC基准上设计VSC-Repeat扰动测试（将视频重复拼接）。

Result: NoSense在VSR基准上达到95%准确率，表明无需空间认知即可解决；VSC-Repeat测试使Cambrian-S准确率从42%降至0%，证明其依赖基准中的捷径。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准不能可靠测量空间超感知，Cambrian-S的推理方法通过利用基准捷径而非真正的空间认知能力来提高性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Motivation: 现有UV展开方法在处理AI生成的网格时表现不佳，这些网格通常噪声多、凹凸不平且条件差，导致图表高度碎片化和边界不理想，影响下游任务。

Method: 基于PartField部件分解方法，结合高层语义部件分解和新的几何启发式算法，采用自上而下的递归框架，确保每个图表的失真低于用户指定阈值，同时最小化总图表数量。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的评估显示，PartUV在图表数量和接缝长度上优于现有工具和神经方法，失真程度相当，在挑战性网格上具有高成功率，并支持部件特定的多瓦片打包等新应用。

Conclusion: PartUV通过部件对齐的UV展开方法，有效解决了AI生成网格的UV展开问题，在保持低失真的同时减少了图表碎片化，为下游任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D通过消除优化过程实现了高效的4D生成，在时间一致性、运动准确性、计算效率和视觉保真度方面表现出色，为可控4D虚拟形象生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner通过创新的表示方法和训练策略，成功实现了准确灵活的多物体9D姿态控制，为可控图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

Conclusion: 简单的RL方法能够有效训练视觉语言模型实现自适应快慢思维切换，在保证性能的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Result: 以Qwen2.5-VL为基础模型，EvoLMM在多模态数学推理基准（ChartQA、MathVista、MathVision）上实现约3%的稳定提升，仅使用原始训练图像。

Conclusion: EvoLMM提供了一个简单有效的完全无监督自改进LMM基线，有望促进未来自进化多模态模型的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar：从单张或稀疏图像重建可动画3D人体化身，无需姿态输入，避免了噪声姿态估计对重建质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量显著下降。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar方法，仅从图像重建化身，完全去除对测试时人体姿态输入的依赖。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，在无真实姿态的实际设置中优于现有基线，在有真实姿态的实验室设置中也能获得相当结果。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar通过消除对姿态输入的依赖，提高了在噪声姿态估计环境下的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查多语言LLM中思维链推理的归因模式，发现归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤、结构化CoT提示主要对高资源拉丁语系语言有效、受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多语言LLM中思维链推理的忠实性和可解释性，特别是在不同语言环境下的表现。

Method: 使用ContextCite进行步骤级归因和Inseq进行令牌级归因，在Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct模型上应用MGSM基准测试，并进行否定和干扰句的受控扰动实验。

Result: 归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤（尤其在错误生成中）；结构化CoT提示显著提高高资源拉丁语系语言的准确性；受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。

Conclusion: 思维链提示在多语言鲁棒性和解释透明度方面存在局限性，需要改进以增强跨语言的可解释性。

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

Motivation: 现有心理理论基准主要关注错误信念任务和不对称信息推理，忽视了信念之外的其他心理状态和丰富的非语言交流。

Method: 利用专家策划的身体语言参考作为知识库，构建包含细粒度非语言线索标注和人工验证心理解释的视频数据集。

Result: 当前AI系统在非语言线索解释方面表现不佳，在检测方面存在显著性能差距，在解释方面相比人类标注者表现出过度解释模式。

Conclusion: 机器在理解非语言线索方面仍有很大挑战，需要进一步研究提升这方面的能力。

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

TL;DR: 提出了TOD-ProcBench基准，用于评估LLM在多轮任务导向对话中遵循复杂过程指令的能力，包含三个任务：相关语句检索与动作预测、指令违规响应识别、条件生成指令遵循响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TOD基准过度简化复杂指令为简单模式，无法反映现实世界中代理需要严格遵循包含复杂约束的自然语言指令的需求。

Method: 基于高质量ABCD数据集构建包含复杂过程指令的基准，将细粒度约束和动作程序表述为多级条件-动作指令语句，设计三个评估任务。

Result: 构建了包含复杂约束的指令文档和对应对话数据集，系统评估了LLM在多种设置下的指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench填补了现有基准的不足，为评估LLM在复杂任务导向对话中的指令遵循能力提供了系统框架，并分析了多语言和指令格式对性能的影响。

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型谎言检测技术通常在狭窄的设置中进行验证，无法捕捉模型可能生成的各种谎言类型，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建LIARS' BENCH测试平台，包含4个开源模型在7个数据集上生成的72,863个谎言和诚实回答示例，涵盖不同谎言类型和两个维度：说谎原因和信念对象。

Result: 评估三种黑白盒谎言检测技术发现，现有技术在某些类型的谎言检测上系统性失败，特别是在仅从文本本身无法判断模型是否说谎的情况下。

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH揭示了现有技术的局限性，为谎言检测技术的进步提供了实用的测试平台。

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

TL;DR: 提出LTLA方法，结合语言模型和可处理代理模型，通过单次批量HMM更新和固定代理解码器，高效解决受控文本生成中的未来依赖约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用可处理代理模型近似延续概率分布，但这些代理模型通常上下文感知能力弱，影响生成质量。需要一种既能利用语言模型丰富上下文编码，又能高效处理未来依赖约束的方法。

Method: LTLA方法将基础语言模型用于丰富前缀编码，与固定可处理代理模型配对计算精确延续概率。通过单次批量HMM更新处理所有候选词，仅让代理模型的潜在状态先验依赖于LM隐藏表示，保持代理解码器固定以实现计算复用。

Result: 实验表明LTLA获得比无条件HMM更高的条件似然，能够近似视觉语言模型的延续分布，在受控生成任务中在保持相似流畅度的同时提高了约束满足率，且推理开销最小。

Conclusion: LTLA是一种有效的混合方法，通过巧妙结合语言模型的上下文编码能力和代理模型的可处理性，解决了受控文本生成中的未来依赖约束问题，在效率和效果上都表现出色。

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

Result: 在不同任务上优于最先进的提示优化方法，如在ArSarcasm数据集上F1分数提高7.6

Conclusion: ELPO框架通过集成学习方法实现了更准确和鲁棒的提示优化

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Motivation: 传统PEFT方法对所有位置索引都应用修改，但作者质疑这种全面修改的必要性，认为可能造成资源浪费甚至负面影响。

Method: 引入Token-Selective PEFT框架，通过函数S选择性地对位置索引子集应用PEFT修改，而不是对所有位置进行修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，对所有位置索引不加选择地应用PEFT不仅多余，甚至可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 为PEFT研究提供了新视角，主张采用更有针对性的修改方法，并为未来优化大模型微调过程提供了框架。

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE)框架，从结构信息角度量化LLM的语义不确定性以检测幻觉，通过自适应稀疏化有向语义图和层次抽象建模语义空间，在29个模型-数据集组合上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法主要依赖语义概率分布或成对距离，忽略了潜在的语义结构信息，这可能导致不确定性估计不够精确。在安全关键场景中，可靠的不确定性量化对于避免LLM产生幻觉至关重要。

Method: 1. 开发自适应稀疏化有向语义图构建算法，捕捉方向性语义依赖同时自动修剪引入负面干扰的连接；2. 通过层次抽象利用潜在语义结构信息：SeSE定义为最优语义编码树的结构熵，形式化语义空间在最优压缩后的内在不确定性；3. 扩展SeSE到长文本生成，通过建模随机语义交互量化单个声明的不确定性。

Result: 在29个模型-数据集组合上的广泛实验表明，SeSE显著优于先进的不确定性量化基线，包括强监督方法和最近提出的KLE。

Conclusion: SeSE框架通过利用语义结构信息，为LLM提供了更精确的不确定性量化，有效检测幻觉，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SDA（Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment），一种无需训练、模型无关的对齐框架，通过动态重分布模型输出概率来增强LLMs与人类意图的对齐，在3H维度上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实应用中的广泛部署，确保其响应与人类意图对齐成为基础挑战，特别是在无需昂贵重训练或大量监督的情况下实现推理时的有效对齐。

Method: SDA基于用户定义的对齐指令动态重分布模型输出概率，无需微调即可增强模型行为与人类意图的对齐，支持个性化偏好对齐，可独立使用或与训练策略集成。

Result: 在8个不同规模和来源的开源LLMs上，SDA在3H维度上平均提升：帮助性64.4%、诚实性30%、无害性11.5%，证明其有效性和跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: SDA是一种轻量级、资源高效的对齐框架，能够显著提升LLMs在推理时与人类意图的对齐性能，支持个性化控制，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出自我重写框架，通过模型重写自身推理文本并从中学习，以改进推理过程质量，在保持GRPO奖励信号的同时显著提升准确率和推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习仅关注最终正确性的奖励无法对内部推理过程提供详细监督，导致推理质量不佳，出现过度思考、思考不足、冗余思考和无序思考等问题。

Method: 采用选择性重写方法，仅对模型持续正确的"简单"样本进行重写，将重写和原始生成整合在单个批次中，保持RL算法的可扩展性并仅增加约10%开销。

Result: 在准确率-长度权衡方面，自我重写方法在准确率提升0.6%的同时大幅减少推理长度46%；在内部推理质量方面，LLM作为评判者的评分显著提高7.2分，有效缓解内部推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 自我重写框架能有效提升大型推理模型的内部推理质量，在减少推理长度的同时提高准确率，为解决推理过程中的质量问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

TL;DR: 本文创建了大规模习语和比喻语言数据集，用于评估预训练语言模型在习语识别任务中的表现，并通过训练和评估来提升模型处理比喻意义的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语和比喻语言在口语和书面语中占比很大，但大型语言模型在处理这类语言时仍存在困难。虽然微调方法效果较好，但更大更好的数据集可以进一步缩小这一差距。

Result: 创建的数据集用于训练和评估槽位标注和序列标记任务，评估了预训练语言模型在习语识别任务中的基线能力。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集为构建新模型和开发新方法提供了多样化的类别基础，有助于提升语言模型处理比喻语言的能力。

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

### [124] [Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16353)
*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自然语言解释（rationales）的评估指标充分性（sufficiency）的局限性，并将其与两种建模范式联系起来：通过token分类识别rationale的能力，以及通过注意力正则化在输入中融入rationale来提升模型性能的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估rationales信息量的充分性指标对模型性能影响提供有限洞察，需要更深入地理解rationale信息如何影响模型表现。

Method: 将充分性与两种建模范式关联分析：1）通过token分类识别rationale的能力；2）通过注意力正则化在输入中融入rationale来提升模型性能。

Result: 发现高度信息化的rationales不一定有助于正确分类；充分性捕捉的是非rationale上下文的分类影响；融入rationale信息可以提升跨域分类但结果不一致；充分性与token分类无关。

Conclusion: rationales的复杂性表明需要开发能够系统捕捉这类信息的评估指标，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML是一个基于语言模型的HTML到文本提取管道，将内容提取重新定义为序列标注问题，显著提升了网页内容提取质量，特别是在结构化元素（代码、公式、表格）的保留方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页语料库主要依赖启发式提取器（如Trafilatura），这些方法难以保留文档结构并经常损坏结构化元素。作者假设提高提取质量对下游性能的影响可能与积极的过滤策略一样重要。

Method: MinerU-HTML使用0.6B参数的语言模型，将内容提取重新定义为序列标注问题，采用两阶段格式化管道，先明确分类语义元素，再转换为Markdown格式。

Result: 在包含7,887个标注网页的MainWebBench基准测试中，MinerU-HTML达到81.8% ROUGE-N F1，显著优于Trafilatura的63.6%，在结构化元素保留方面表现优异（代码块90.9%，公式94.0%）。使用MinerU-HTML构建的AICC语料库在13个基准测试中平均准确率达到50.8%，比TfCC高出1.08个百分点。

Conclusion: HTML提取是网页语料库构建中一个关键但经常被低估的组件，基于模型的提取方法在质量和可扩展性方面都优于启发式方法。

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习方法是否能够有效区分感知低质量和高质量的新闻文章，为新闻质量自动评估提供技术支持。

Method: 使用3种机器学习分类器和3种深度学习模型，基于包含141万篇新闻文章的数据集，每篇文章提取194个语言特征，按专家对来源网站的评分分为低质量和高质量两类。

Result: 随机森林等传统机器学习模型表现良好（准确率0.7355，ROC AUC 0.8131），而深度学习模型表现更优，ModernBERT-large达到最高准确率0.8744和ROC AUC 0.9593。

Conclusion: 传统CPU机器学习分类器和深度学习分类器都能有效区分全球新闻文章的感知质量，深度学习模型表现更佳。

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer模型如何处理非组合性语言（如习语），探索模型在计算效率和鲁棒性之间的平衡机制。

Method: 采用改进的路径修补算法进行电路发现，识别并分析"习语头"（在多个习语中频繁激活的注意力头）和"增强接收"（习语token间因早期处理而增强的注意力）。

Result: 发现习语处理具有独特的计算模式，识别出特定的习语头和增强接收现象，这些机制帮助Transformer平衡计算效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解Transformer处理非组合性语言提供了见解，并为理解更复杂语法结构的处理指明了路径。

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

*Özay Ezerceli,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Selva Taş,Reyhan Bayraktar,Fatma Betül Terzioğlu,Yusuf Çelebi,Yağız Asker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT是首个针对土耳其语检索的全面基准测试，比较了密集编码器和延迟交互模型。结果显示延迟交互模型在参数效率上显著优于密集编码器，3-5倍小的模型性能更好，ColmmBERT-base-TR在特定领域任务上mAP提升达13.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经信息检索系统在高资源语言中表现出色，但对于形态丰富的低资源语言如土耳其语研究不足。虽然密集双编码器目前在土耳其语IR中占主导地位，但保留令牌级表示进行细粒度匹配的延迟交互模型尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 采用两阶段适应流程：首先在土耳其语NLI/STS任务上微调英语和多语言编码器，然后使用在MS MARCO-TR上训练的PyLate将其转换为ColBERT风格的检索器。评估了10个模型在5个土耳其BEIR数据集上的表现，涵盖科学、金融和论证领域。

Result: 延迟交互模型表现出强大的参数效率：1.0M参数的colbert-hash-nano-tr比600M参数的turkish-e5-large密集编码器小600倍，同时保持了其平均mAP的71%以上。3-5倍小于密集编码器的延迟交互模型显著优于它们；ColmmBERT-base-TR在特定领域任务上mAP提升达13.8%。

Conclusion: TurkColBERT基准测试证明了延迟交互模型在土耳其语检索中的有效性，特别是在参数效率和特定领域性能方面。MUVERA+Rerank索引算法比PLAID快3.33倍，并提供+1.7%的相对mAP增益，实现了低延迟检索。所有检查点、配置和评估脚本均已发布。

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型对于确保其安全有益部署至关重要，但由于LLM结构的不可解释性和无法人工评估所有输出，这一任务变得复杂。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B模型，基于其激活状态来预测提示文本的体裁，采用scikit-learn分类器进行浅层学习建模。

Result: 在两个数据集上，体裁预测的F1分数分别达到98%和71%，结果始终优于控制任务。

Conclusion: 这提供了一个概念验证，表明可以通过浅层学习模型从LLM中推断文本体裁。

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR在临床对话中的评估主要依赖WER，但缺乏对错误临床影响的考量，需要建立更符合临床安全需求的评估标准。

Method: 通过专家临床医生标注黄金标准，比较了WER等传统指标与临床影响的相关性，然后使用GEPA优化LLM来复制专家评估。

Result: WER与临床风险标签相关性差，优化后的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型达到90%准确率和0.816的Cohen's κ，性能可与人类专家媲美。

Conclusion: 提出了一个经过验证的自动化框架，将ASR评估从简单的文本保真度转向必要的、可扩展的临床对话安全性评估。

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决词义消歧这一自然语言理解基础挑战，现有方法主要针对粗粒度表示且需要手工标注训练数据，难以自动消歧更丰富的表示（如基于OpenCyc），这些表示对于复杂推理至关重要。

Method: 将符号NLU系统生成的多个候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，使用LLM查询根据语言上下文选择适当解释，然后将选定的含义传播回符号NLU系统。

Result: 通过与人工标注的金标准答案比较来评估方法有效性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需手工标注训练数据的词义消歧解决方案，能够处理更丰富的语义表示，为复杂推理任务提供支持。

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态RAG系统中的两种检索方法：基于文本分块检索和直接多模态嵌入检索，发现直接多模态嵌入检索在金融财报问答任务中显著优于基于LLM摘要的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态RAG系统依赖LLM摘要将图像转换为文本，导致上下文信息和视觉细节丢失，影响下游检索和问答性能。

Method: 对两种检索方法进行对比分析：文本分块检索（图像先被摘要成文本再嵌入）和直接多模态嵌入检索（图像以原生形式存储在向量空间中），在6个LLM模型和2个多模态嵌入模型上进行评估。

Result: 直接多模态嵌入检索显著优于基于LLM摘要的方法，在mAP@5上绝对提升13%（相对提升32%），在nDCG@5上绝对提升11%（相对提升20%），且产生更准确和事实一致的答案。

Conclusion: LLM摘要在预处理过程中引入信息损失，而直接多模态嵌入能够为检索和推理保留视觉上下文信息。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

TL;DR: Nemotron Elastic是一个用于构建推理导向LLM的框架，通过单一父模型嵌入多个嵌套子模型，每个子模型针对不同部署配置和预算进行优化，无需额外训练即可零样本提取，大幅降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练针对不同规模和部署目标的大型语言模型家族成本极高，需要为每个不同大小的模型进行单独训练。现有的模型压缩方法虽然降低了成本，但每个压缩模型仍需数百亿token的训练成本。

Method: 采用混合Mamba-Attention架构，通过端到端训练的路由器与两阶段训练课程相结合，引入组感知SSM弹性化、异构MLP弹性化、基于归一化MSE的层重要性评估以及知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 应用于Nemotron Nano V2 12B模型，仅用110B训练token同时生成9B和6B模型，相比从头训练模型家族成本降低360倍以上，相比最先进的压缩技术降低约7倍。每个嵌套模型在准确性上达到或优于最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅大幅降低了训练成本，还实现了多合一推理模型，使部署内存相对于模型家族中的模型数量保持恒定，这是其他压缩方法无法实现的优势。

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Quality Engineering (QE) by automating the generation of artefacts such as requirements, test cases, and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. However, ensuring the quality of these outputs remains a challenge. This paper presents a systematic technique to baseline and evaluate QE artefacts using quantifiable metrics. The approach combines LLM-driven generation, reverse generation , and iterative refinement guided by rubrics technique for clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability. Experimental results across 12 projects show that reverse-generated artefacts can outperform low-quality inputs and maintain high standards when inputs are strong. The framework enables scalable, reliable QE artefact validation, bridging automation with accountability.

TL;DR: RGym是一个轻量级的Linux内核自动程序修复评估框架，在本地硬件上运行，使用专门的定位技术和GPT-5 Thinking模型，在143个bug上达到43.36%的修复成功率，成本低于每bug 0.20美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前APR基准主要关注用户空间应用，忽略了内核空间调试和修复的复杂性。Linux内核由于其单体结构、并发性和低级硬件交互而带来独特挑战，现有方法成功率低或依赖昂贵复杂的基础设施。

Method: 提出RGym轻量级平台无关的APR评估框架，使用专门的定位技术（如调用栈和归咎提交）来克服KGym中不切实际的神谕使用，构建简单有效的APR流水线。

Result: 在143个已验证bug上测试，使用GPT-5 Thinking模型达到最高43.36%的通过率，每个bug成本低于0.20美元。消融研究显示定位策略、提示结构和模型选择都有贡献，基于反馈的重试能显著提高成功率。

Conclusion: RGym提供了一个成本效益高的Linux内核APR解决方案，证明了专门的定位技术和轻量级框架在内核空间程序修复中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在软件工程中应用广泛，但其生成的代码存在结构质量问题，经常复制不良编码实践，引入代码异味。现有研究缺乏对这些问题的产生机制和时机的深入理解。

Method: 基于PSC（倾向性异味评分）概率度量，建立其作为结构质量信号的稳健性；使用PSC进行因果分析，识别生成策略、模型大小、架构和提示设计对代码结构的影响；开展用户研究验证PSC的有效性。

Result: 发现提示设计和架构选择对异味倾向起决定性作用；提出了实用的缓解策略来减少异味发生；用户研究表明PSC能帮助开发者理解模型行为和评估代码质量。

Conclusion: 这项工作为将质量感知评估集成到LLM代码生成评估和部署中奠定了基础，证明异味倾向信号可以支持人类判断。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERP系统的工作流逻辑缺乏适应性，难以管理事件驱动和数据密集的医疗环境，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用机器学习触发器、异常检测和流程挖掘分析技术，构建AI驱动的事件驱动编排框架，自动响应库存耗尽、付款延迟等运营事件。

Result: 多组织案例分析显示在流程效率、成本可视性和决策准确性方面获得显著提升。

Conclusion: 将AI能力嵌入Workday的事件驱动架构可增强运营韧性、治理和可扩展性，为医疗企业下一代自动化策略提供参考。

Abstract: The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem. However, traditional workflow logic in ERP systems often lacks the adaptability required to manage event-driven and data-intensive healthcare environments.
  This study proposes an AI-enabled event-driven orchestration framework within Workday ERP that intelligently synchronizes financial and supply-chain workflows across distributed healthcare entities. The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.

Motivation: 高质量数据标注要求对开发安全可靠的自动驾驶AI感知系统至关重要，但目前其制定和管理研究不足，导致不一致性、安全风险和监管问题。

Method: 对来自6家国际公司和4个研究机构的参与者进行19个半结构化访谈，并进行主题分析。

Result: 识别出五大关键挑战（模糊性、边缘案例复杂性、需求演变、不一致性、资源限制）和三大最佳实践类别（符合伦理标准、改进标注指南、嵌入式质量保证），揭示了标注要求与AI系统性能的关键关联。

Conclusion: 这是首个提供基于实证的标注要求改进指南的研究，为提升标注质量、监管合规性和系统可靠性提供可行见解，填补了软件工程和需求工程在AI领域的研究空白。

Abstract: High-quality data annotation requirements are crucial for the development of safe and reliable AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) in autonomous driving. Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于智能体和流水线的方法依赖不充分的测试，可能导致补丁通过验证但未能真正修复底层缺陷，需要更可靠的仓库级问题解决方案。

Method: 使用对抗性多智能体框架，包含测试补丁生成器、代码补丁生成器和选择器智能体，在容器化环境中进行迭代式的测试和补丁改进。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite和SWE-bench Verified上的实验显示，InfCode持续优于强基线方法，在SWE-bench Verified上达到79.4%的性能，创下新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: InfCode通过对抗性交互和多智能体协作，有效解决了仓库级软件问题，成为开源可用的自动化问题解决框架。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified using models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show that InfCode consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We have released InfCode as an open-source project at https://github.com/Tokfinity/InfCode.

TL;DR: INFCODE-C++是首个针对C++的自主问题解决系统，通过语义代码意图检索和确定性AST结构化查询相结合，在MultiSWE-bench-CPP基准测试中达到25.58%的解决率，比之前最强代理高出10.85个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理主要针对Python设计，在C++项目中表现不佳，因为C++存在重载标识符、嵌套命名空间、模板实例化和深度控制流结构等复杂特性，使得上下文检索和故障定位更加困难。

Method: 结合两种互补的检索机制：语义代码意图检索和确定性AST结构化查询，构建准确的语言感知上下文进行修复。

Result: 在MultiSWE-bench-CPP基准测试中达到25.58%的解决率，比之前最强代理高出10.85个百分点，是MSWE-agent性能的两倍多。

Conclusion: INFCODE-C++强调了在多语言软件代理中需要语言感知推理，并为未来在复杂静态类型生态系统中进行可扩展的LLM驱动修复研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了文本漏洞描述的关键方面不一致问题，提高了漏洞理解的全面性和效率

Abstract: Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.

TL;DR: LLM生成的Solidity智能合约在语义相似度上表现良好，但功能正确性较低（仅20-26%），生成的代码更简单且gas消耗更低，常因省略验证逻辑。检索增强生成(RAG)能显著提升性能，功能正确性提高45%，生成更简洁高效的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约是区块链生态的关键组件，但LLM在生成Solidity代码时面临gas消耗、安全性和确定性等独特约束，现有研究缺乏对这些关键功能和非功能属性的全面评估。

Method: 在零样本和检索增强生成设置下对4个最先进模型进行基准测试，涵盖500个真实函数。采用代码相似度指标、语义嵌入、自动化测试执行、gas分析、认知和圈复杂度分析等多方面评估。

Result: LLM生成的代码与真实合约具有高语义相似度，但功能正确性低；生成的代码复杂度更低、gas消耗更少；RAG显著提升性能，功能正确性提高45%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的智能合约存在语义相似度与功能合理性之间的显著差距，虽然RAG是强大的增强工具，但要实现稳健的生产就绪代码生成仍需专家仔细验证。

Abstract: Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.

Motivation: 随着NSFW内容在主流平台上的普及，需要探索如何在遵守伦理和法律的同时实现商业化，并解决非自愿内容分享等风险问题。

Method: 研究了15个最大的NSFW受限子版块，分析了用户行为模式，并训练了基于RoBERTa的分类模型来识别非自愿内容分享行为。

Result: 发现用户使用NSFW子版块作为社交跳板转向其他平台进行交易，存在非自愿内容分享现象。RoBERTa模型在识别此类行为上优于GPT-4和传统分类器。

Conclusion: NSFW内容分享存在复杂的伦理和法律挑战，需要有效的监管工具。开发的RoBERTa模型为平台提供了有效的非自愿内容识别解决方案。

Abstract: Reddit is in the minority of mainstream social platforms that permit posting content that may be considered to be at the edge of what is permissible, including so-called Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. However, NSFW is becoming more common on mainstream platforms, with X now allowing such material. We examine the top 15 NSFW-restricted subreddits by size to explore the complexities of responsibly sharing adult content, aiming to balance ethical and legal considerations with monetization opportunities. We find that users often use NSFW subreddits as a social springboard, redirecting readers to private or specialized adult social platforms such as Telegram, Kik or OnlyFans for further interactions. They also directly negotiate image "trades" through credit cards or payment platforms such as PayPal, Bitcoin or Venmo. Disturbingly, we also find linguistic cues linked to non-consensual content sharing. To help platforms moderate such behavior, we trained a RoBERTa-based classification model, which outperforms GPT-4 and traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and random forest in identifying non-consensual content sharing, demonstrating superior performance in this specific task. The source code and trained model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/socsys/15NSFW Subreddits.

TL;DR: 研究发现美国有线电视新闻黄金时段意见节目的辩论比例持续下降，党派偏见明显，保守派在福克斯新闻、自由派在MSNBC很少受到挑战，CNN趋于中立，而极化议题如堕胎、枪支权利等吸引的辩论最少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在政治极化加剧的时代，需要量化这些声称呈现竞争观点的电视节目是否真正促进讨论，还是已沦为加深社会分裂的党派回音室。

Method: 收集2010-2024年福克斯新闻、MSNBC和CNN的24个旗舰节目的21000多集，将其分割为主持人-嘉宾轮次，使用高保真大型语言模型分类器标记213万个轮次对。

Result: 辩论比例呈下降趋势，2017-2024年间下降约三分之一；现场挑战存在党派不对称性；极化议题吸引的辩论最少。

Conclusion: 电视"辩论"正在远离真正的讨论，转变为党派肯定的平台，侵蚀多元社会必需的交叉分歧，加剧情感极化。

Abstract: Prime-time cable news programs are a highly influential part of the American media landscape, with top-rated opinion shows attracting millions of politically attentive viewers each night. In an era of intense political polarization, a critical question is whether these widely-watched "debate" shows foster genuine discussion or have devolved into partisan echo chambers that deepen societal divides. While these programs claim to air competing viewpoints, no large-scale evidence exists to quantify how often hosts and guests actually disagree. Measuring these exchanges is a significant challenge, as live broadcasts contain overlapping speakers, sarcasm, and billions of words of text. To address this gap, we construct the first speaker-resolved map of agreement and disagreement across U.S. cable opinion programming. Our study assembles over 21,000 episodes from 24 flagship shows on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN from 2010-2024, segmenting them into host-guest turns and labeling 2.13 million turn-pairs using a high-fidelity large-language-model classifier. We present three findings: (1) the proportion of disagreement/debate on prime time shows a consistent downward trend, dropping by roughly one-third between 2017 and 2024; (2) on-air challenge is partisan and asymmetric--conservatives seldom face push-back on Fox, liberals seldom on MSNBC, with CNN declining toward the midpoint; and (3) polarizing issues such as abortion, gun rights, and immigration attract the least disagreement. The work contributes a public corpus, an open-source stance pipeline, and the first longitudinal evidence that televised "debate" is retreating from genuine discussion.

### [150] [Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16068)
*Jilong Shi,Qiuyan Yan,Xiaobin Rui,Zhixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了时间关键对抗影响阻断最大化(TC-AIBM)问题，通过时间关键独立级联(TC-IC)模型解决传统IC模型忽略时间因素的问题，并证明了目标函数的子模性，提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIBM研究基于经典IC模型，忽略了时间因素，不适用于政治竞选、公共紧急事件等时间关键场景，且缺乏对目标函数子模性的深入研究，无法提供理论下界保证。

Method: 提出TC-IC模型引入时间约束，建立TC-AIBM问题，证明其在三种平局打破规则下的子模性，并提出双向影响采样(BIS)算法求解。

Result: BIS算法在四个真实数据集上表现出优异的稳定性，优于现有基线方法，效率比贪心算法提升高达三个数量级。

Conclusion: TC-AIBM框架有效解决了时间关键场景下的对抗影响阻断问题，BIS算法在保证近似比的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (AIBM) aims to select a set of positive seed nodes that propagate synchronously with the known negative seed nodes on the graph to counteract their negative influence. Currently, most AIBM studies are based on the classical Independent Cascade (IC) model, which omits the time factor and thus hinders their applications to time-critical scenarios like political campaigns or public emergencies. More importantly, existing AIBM studies have not investigated in-depth the submodularity of the objective function, resulting in their failure to provide a theoretical lower bound for the problem. To address these challenges, firstly, this paper proposes the Time-Critical Independent Cascade (TC-IC) model, which incorporates time constraints into the classical IC model. Secondly, the Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (TC-AIBM) is established to better handle time-critical scenarios. A detailed formulation of the problem is then presented, along with a theoretical proof of its submodularity under three different tie-breaking rules. Finally, a Bidirectional Influence Sampling (BIS) algorithm is proposed to solve the TC-AIBM problem. The submodularity of the objective function guarantees that the BIS can provide an approximation guarantee of
  to the optimal solution. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed BIS algorithm exhibits excellent stability with various negative seeds, time constraints, and tie-breaking rules, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, BIS improves efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the Greedy algorithm.

*Ariel Kamen,Yakov Kamen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成大语言模型(eLLM)框架，通过整合多个LLM来解决单个模型的不一致性、幻觉、类别膨胀和误分类等问题，在零样本条件下显著提升文本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个大语言模型在文本分类中存在不一致性、幻觉、类别膨胀和误分类等弱点，需要开发更可靠和准确的分类方法。

Method: 采用集成学习框架，整合十个最先进的大语言模型，基于IAB分层分类法，在8,660个人工标注样本上进行零样本评估，建立集体决策的数学模型和聚合准则。

Result: eLLM框架相比最强单模型在F1分数上提升了65%，达到接近人类专家水平的性能，同时提高了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: eLLM为基于分类法的文本分类提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，可能显著减少对人类专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Graph-Memoized Reasoning框架，通过图结构记忆表示、存储和重用推理工作流，减少重复计算，提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型推理系统经常在不同任务中重复计算相似的推理步骤，浪费计算资源，增加推理延迟，限制可重现性，需要持久化推理机制来回忆和重用先前的计算轨迹。

Method: 引入Graph-Memoized Reasoning框架，将推理工作流表示为图结构记忆，通过结构和语义相似性检索过去的决策图，实现跨新推理任务的子图组合式重用。

Result: 制定了最小化总推理成本并正则化存储与生成工作流之间不一致性的优化目标，为智能系统中的效率-一致性权衡提供理论基础，并提出了与优化目标一致的概念性评估协议。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释、成本高效和自我改进的推理架构奠定了基础，朝着大规模智能系统中的持久化内存迈出了一步。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体强化学习系统在安全关键应用中使用，理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式变得至关重要。现有可解释AI方法在多智能体环境中存在不足。

Method: MACIE框架结合结构因果模型、干预反事实和Shapley值，通过干预归因分数、协同指标和自然语言叙述提供三种类型的解释。

Result: 在四个MARL场景中评估显示：准确的结果归因（平均φ_i=5.07，标准差<0.05）、合作任务中检测到积极涌现（协同指数高达0.461）、高效计算（CPU上每个数据集0.79秒）。

Conclusion: MACIE独特地结合了因果严谨性、涌现量化和多智能体支持，同时保持实时使用的实用性，代表了向可解释、可信赖和负责任的多智能体AI迈出的一步。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同模态（文本和图像）如何影响模型在ARC-AGI任务中的感知能力，发现结构化文本能精确捕捉稀疏特征，图像能保持2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提升执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI任务需要模型进行系统性泛化，但现有方法缺乏对编码方式如何影响模型感知的深入理解，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，测试不同编码方式对模型感知的影响。

Result: 结构化文本能精确获取坐标信息，图像能保持2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合文本和图像能提升约8个感知点和0.20的中位相似度。

Conclusion: 将表示与transformer的归纳偏差对齐，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下获得更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在轨迹层面验证正确性，忽略了轮次级错误在训练中的传播问题，高质量轨迹数据的稀缺阻碍了LLM代理的发展。

Method: 构建基于参数相关性的函数图，使用多智能体框架模拟用户-助手-工具交互，实施细粒度轮次级过滤移除错误或次优步骤。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，基于ToolMind微调的模型相比基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: ToolMind通过轮次级验证和过滤机制缓解了训练中的错误放大问题，同时保留了自我纠正推理信号，为稳健的工具使用学习提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Chain of Summaries (CoS)方法，通过类似黑格尔辩证法的方式迭代生成信息密集的通用摘要，使网页内容更易于LLM消化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理网页内容时面临的格式不友好和上下文长度限制问题，使外部网页内容更易于LLM使用。

Method: 采用类似黑格尔辩证法的方法：初始摘要作为正题，通过提问识别局限性作为反题，最终生成满足当前和未来信息需求的通用摘要作为合题。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升66%，比专业摘要方法BRIO和PEGASUS提升27%。生成的摘要用更少token实现更高Q&A性能。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了一种使内容更易于LLM访问的可行方案，同时保留人工监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Motivation: 多模态学习系统面临数据噪声、标签质量低、模态特性异质等不确定性挑战，特别是在人机交互场景中数据质量和标注一致性差异显著，需要开发对不确定性具有弹性的学习方法。

Result: 在多模态情感识别基准测试中，一致性引导的跨模态迁移显著提高了模型稳定性、判别能力和对噪声或不完整监督的鲁棒性。潜在空间分析显示即使在挑战性条件下也能捕获可靠的跨模态结构。

Conclusion: 该论文通过整合不确定性建模、语义对齐和数据高效监督，为弹性多模态学习提供了统一视角，为开发可靠和自适应的脑机接口系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

Motivation: 单智能体LLM方法生成模糊、不可用的建议，无法满足生产系统事件响应的需求。

Method: 开发了MyAntFarm.ai框架，通过348次对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事件场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现了100%可操作建议率，而单智能体仅为1.7%；在行动特异性方面改进80倍，解决方案正确性改进140倍；多智能体系统在所有试验中表现出零质量方差。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排不是性能优化，而是基于LLM的事件响应的生产就绪要求，为生产SLA承诺提供了确定性质量保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

Conclusion: 该分类法在当前AI治理状态与关键应用中AI使用的可操作风险评估和管理需求之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite).

*Kangwei Xu,Grace Li Zhang,Ulf Schlichtmann,Bing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CorrectHDL框架，利用HLS结果作为功能参考来纠正LLM生成的HDL设计中的错误，在保持功能正确性的同时显著提升面积和功耗效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在硬件设计中的幻觉问题，这些幻觉会导致生成的HDL设计出现功能错误，影响电路的正确性。

Method: 使用C/C++程序作为输入，通过LLM直接生成HDL设计，用RAG机制修复语法错误，并通过与HLS参考设计的仿真行为比较来迭代改进功能正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持HDL实现的正确性。

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统正确性驱动的IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了智能HDL设计的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Result: 规则方法在信息检索任务中准确性更高（特别是年龄和性别提取），而LLM在药物名称识别方面表现更好，且具有更强的适应性和可扩展性

Conclusion: 建议采用混合方法，结合规则系统的精确性和LLM的适应性，为现实医院环境提供更可靠和资源高效的临床NLP解决方案

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Motivation: 开发一个能够同时处理学习者边界框标注、视线样本和自由文本观察的智能教学系统，帮助医学实习生提高胸片解读能力，解决传统教学中的局限性。

Method: 使用AutoGen框架构建多智能体系统，包含定位质量评估、苏格拉底式辅导、PubMed证据检索、相似病例推荐和视觉语言推理等专门智能体，结合贝叶斯知识追踪和肺叶分割模块。

Result: 系统展示了响应迅速的辅导流程、可控的答案泄露机制，以及与REFLACX数据集的集成能力，初步评估显示相比基线方法在定位和诊断推理方面有所改进。

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR证明了多智能体对话系统在医学影像教学中的有效性，具备实时部署的扩展性，能够显著提升学习者的胸片解读技能。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在现实世界决策中面临挑战，包括多目标优化、从稀疏经验中学习、随机环境下的长期规划以及空间推理等。现有基准测试孤立了这些能力，无法评估整体决策能力。

Method: 开发了Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs) 模拟器，统一了环境建模、长期不确定性规划、复杂业务运营等挑战，并提供人类基线和最先进LLM智能体的全面评估。

Result: 人类在简单模式下表现优于LLM智能体6.5倍，在中等模式下优于9.8倍。分析揭示了在长期优化、样本高效学习、空间推理和世界建模方面的持续弱点。

Conclusion: MAPs通过统一这些挑战，为能够进行适应性决策的智能体基准测试提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Motivation: 解决音频语言模型中存在的困惑现象：推理越少性能越好，探索音频智能是否能真正受益于深思熟虑。

Method: 提出模态接地推理蒸馏(MGRD)框架，让模型学习生成基于声学特征的音频相关推理链，避免产生脱节的推理。

Result: 模型在涵盖语音、环境声音和音乐的全面音频理解和推理基准测试中表现出强大的音频推理能力，超越Gemini 2.5 Pro，达到与Gemini 3 Pro相当的性能。

Conclusion: 推理是跨模态可转移的能力，当适当锚定时，扩展的深思熟虑可以从负担转变为音频智能的强大资产，为构建真正多模态推理系统开辟新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

*Ivan Chulo,Ananya Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过分析激活导向对LLM心智理论能力的影响，发现成功的心智理论能力主要依赖于情感理解而非分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明激活导向能显著提升语言模型的心智理论能力，但其内部机制如何导致不同输出仍不清楚。

Method: 使用线性探针分析45种认知行为，对比导向与基线LLM的激活模式，在Gemma-3-4B模型上应用对比激活加法导向，并在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中评估。

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升到46.7%，这种提升主要由情感内容处理（情感感知+2.23，情感价值+2.20）驱动，同时抑制了分析过程（质疑-0.78，收敛思维-1.59）。

Conclusion: LLM中成功的心智理论能力由情感理解介导，而非分析推理。

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的自校正框架能有效改善LLM的推理连贯性和忠实性，通过实时不确定性检测提升模型的内省能力

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-judge框架依赖答案比较，难以自动化且不支持细粒度评估。小型模型在判断答案正确性方面的能力尚不明确。

Method: 提出JudgeBoard评估管道，直接查询模型评估答案正确性。开发MAJ多智能体判断框架，使用多个具有不同推理特征的小型模型通过协作审议来提升判断性能。

Result: 实验显示小型模型与大型模型在独立判断任务中存在显著性能差距，但MAJ框架显著提升了小型模型的可靠性和一致性。在MATH数据集上，使用较小模型的MAJ表现与较大模型相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 多智能体小型模型系统在判断任务中可能匹配或超越大型模型性能，对可扩展和高效评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在临床决策中的知识鸿沟、数据隐私、高部署成本和有限推理能力等根本限制，实现低成本、高安全性的复杂医疗决策支持部署。

Method: 采用教师模型推理自动提取知识和推理轨迹，通过答案到问题的反向生成；使用启发式学习进行半监督数据增强（减少约80%人工标注需求）；利用智能强化学习联合增强医学知识和推理能力；采用分层评估和模块化接口设计。

Result: 在外部开源基准MEDQA上，知识问答能力（Accuracy@1）比SFT提高1.8%，比RAG提高3.6%；在外部基准PUMCH Antimicrobial上，推理能力（Pass@1）比SFT和RAG均提高约27%；仅需SFT长期训练成本的约20%。

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLMs临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，能够在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Result: 在官方Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B潜伏代理模型上，系统达到92.5%准确率、100%精确度和85%召回率，实时检测时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测能有效识别欺骗性模型行为，且不影响部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Method: 使用书面暴露疗法指南作为测试平台，评估模型对经过临床医生审核的问题的响应，并提出评估推理准确性、一致性和忠实度的框架。

Result: 发现即使提供权威段落，模型错误仍然存在，检索增强生成可以约束输出，但安全部署需要严格评估推理质量。

Conclusion: 在临床环境中部署大语言模型时，需要像评估检索质量一样严格评估推理质量，以确保输出的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

Result: 在近5000个实例上的计算实验表明，所提模型在小到中型实例（最多100个作业）上表现优越，在大型实例（最多500个作业、10个家族、10台机器）上能找到比现有方法好25%的解。

Conclusion: 新的CP模型通过消除对虚拟批次集合的依赖，提供了更紧凑和高效的解决方案，在串行批处理调度问题上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型正在根本性改变会计研究，为学者创造机遇和竞争威胁，需要理解这些变化并制定应对策略。

Method: 提出二维分类框架（研究焦点：会计中心vsAI中心；方法：AI方法vs传统方法），应用于IJAIS特刊和主要会计期刊的AI会计研究论文。

Result: 分析显示GenAI在使某些研究能力民主化的同时，通过提高对高阶贡献的期望加剧了竞争，人类判断、创造力和理论深度仍具价值。

Conclusion: 需要改革博士教育以培养比较优势，同时建立AI素养，会计学者应通过战略定位和合作利用其专业知识优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的云边缘工作负载资源管理过于被动，依赖静态阈值会导致资源过度配置或性能下降，因此需要开发主动解决方案来预测问题而非被动响应。

Method: 设计混合架构，结合CNN-LSTM模型进行时间序列预测，并将预测结果直接嵌入基于多智能体深度强化学习的编排器的状态空间。

Result: 测试表明该系统明显优于传统方法，能够有效解决复杂决策问题，同时平衡成本节约、系统健康和应用程序性能等多个目标。

Conclusion: 通过赋予AI管理器预见未来的能力，系统能够制定长期计划，在节省成本与保持系统健康、应用快速之间找到最佳平衡点，实现平滑的资源管理路径。

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

Conclusion: TOFA是一种高效、轻量级的单次联邦视觉语言模型适配方法，能够充分利用预训练模型的多模态特征，有效处理数据异构性，且无需额外训练资源。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MR-RML框架，通过GPRC技术解决LLM在医疗领域应用的三个关键对齐挑战：静态评估与动态临床需求的脱节、适应多源医疗标准的困难、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗实践中具有变革潜力，但其实际临床效用受到关键对齐挑战的限制：静态评估基准与动态临床认知需求脱节、难以适应不断发展的多源医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准。

Method: 提出MR-RML框架，包含三个核心创新：1）"维度-场景-学科"医疗标准系统；2）独立多维奖励模型；3）几何投影参考约束，将医疗认知逻辑转化为数学正则化。

Result: 在权威医疗基准Healthbench上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B，在完整子集上提升45%，在困难子集上提升85%，在开源LLM中达到SOTA水平（完整子集62.7分，困难子集44.7分），并超越大多数闭源模型。

Conclusion: MR-RML框架通过结构化医疗标准集成和多维奖励建模，有效解决了LLM在医疗领域的对齐问题，显著提升了模型在复杂医疗场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理训练和评估数据集多为静态理想化环境，无法反映现实世界环境的复杂性和不可预测性，特别是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出D-GARA框架，引入多种现实世界异常类型（如权限对话框、电池警告、更新提示等），构建包含常用Android应用和嵌入异常的基准测试集。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的GUI代理在异常丰富环境中性能显著下降，凸显了鲁棒性学习的必要性。

Conclusion: D-GARA是模块化和可扩展的框架，支持新任务、异常类型和交互场景的无缝集成，为社区研究提供支持。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

<details>

Motivation: 当前足球视频理解方法在构建可靠的逐场比赛数据方面仍不足，需要人工辅助标注。同时战术建模、轨迹预测等研究需要基于比赛状态和逐场比赛数据，因此需要利用战术知识作为先验来支持基于计算机视觉的预测。

Method: 引入FOOTPASS数据集，支持开发结合计算机视觉任务输出（如跟踪、识别）和足球战术知识（包括长期战术规律）的球员中心动作识别方法。

Result: 创建了首个覆盖整场足球比赛的多模态、多智能体战术背景的动作识别基准数据集。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集为数据驱动的体育分析提供了关键输入，能够生成可靠的逐场比赛数据流，支持更自动化和可靠的比赛数据分析。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Result: 形成发现、解释和泛化相互加强的闭环知识系统

Conclusion: 这种集成将推动领域从盲目搜索转向可解释的、特定类别的算法设计，同时产生关于优化策略何时及为何成功的可重用科学见解

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分透明度有限。

Method: 将偏好评估分解为领域特定的智能体，每个产生部分信号，配合全局评估器（如基于排序和嵌入相似性的奖励）。中央聚合器在每个时间步融合这些信号，平衡逐步正确性、多智能体一致性和重复惩罚等因素。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作奖励模型框架能够在不增加额外人工标注的情况下，实现多视角奖励塑造，提高RLHF的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了真实世界教育内容的大规模使用，为改进面向推理的LLM训练提供了实用的合成数据生成替代方案。

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

### [192] [MuISQA: Multi-Intent Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Scientific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16283)
*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对多意图科学问答的基准测试MuISQA，并开发了一种意图感知检索框架，通过LLM假设答案、分解意图特定查询，使用RRF重排来提升异构证据覆盖率和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常面向单一意图，导致复杂科学问题中多意图任务的证据覆盖不完整，需要评估和改进多意图场景下的检索能力。

Method: 使用LLM假设潜在答案并分解为意图特定查询，为每个意图检索支持段落，然后通过RRF聚合和重排检索结果以平衡多样意图的覆盖并减少冗余。

Result: 在MuISQA基准测试和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖率方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能有效解决多意图科学问答中的证据覆盖问题，显著提升RAG系统在复杂科学问题上的表现。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了一个跨分布式系统的代理间通信概念验证，仅使用自然语言消息，无需共享标识符、结构化模式或集中式数据交换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多个组织如何通过假名化案例令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界进行安全协作，同时保持数据本地化。

Method: 使用Orpius平台进行多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信，通过OperationRelay调用交换简洁的自然语言摘要，各代理仅操作自有数据。

Result: 成功演示了诊所、保险公司和专科医生网络之间的分布式推理可行性，实现了隐私保护的代理间协作。

Conclusion: 该原型证明了去中心化多代理系统的可行性，并指出了未来在更严格评估和研究方面的机会。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Motivation: Android恶意软件领域合成数据质量评估存在挑战，现有指标不稳定且缺乏标准化。

Method: 在MalDataGen中集成Super-Metric，聚合8个指标到4个保真度维度，产生单一加权分数。

Result: 在10个生成模型和5个平衡数据集上的实验显示，Super-Metric比传统指标更稳定和一致，与分类器实际性能相关性更强。

Conclusion: Super-Metric为Android恶意软件合成数据质量评估提供了更可靠和标准化的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthetic data remains a persistent challenge in the Android malware domain due to instability and the lack of standardization among existing metrics. This work integrates into MalDataGen a Super-Metric that aggregates eight metrics across four fidelity dimensions, producing a single weighted score. Experiments involving ten generative models and five balanced datasets demonstrate that the Super-Metric is more stable and consistent than traditional metrics, exhibiting stronger correlations with the actual performance of classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业不信任智能体处理生产数据，因为传统数据湖仓不适合智能体的访问模式。论文认为解决基础设施问题是实现可信智能体工作流的第一步。

Method: 提出Bauplan设计，重新实现数据和计算隔离，借鉴数据库MVCC概念但针对解耦、多语言环境进行优化，提供了一个自修复管道的参考实现。

Result: Bauplan能够无缝地将智能体推理与所需的正确性和可信性保证相结合，为智能体工作流提供必要的隔离和治理机制。

Conclusion: 通过设计面向智能体的数据湖仓基础设施，可以解决智能体在生产环境中的可信性问题，治理机制自然随之而来。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Pharos-ESG框架，将ESG报告转化为结构化表示，通过多模态解析、上下文叙述和层次化标注来解决ESG报告阅读顺序混乱和结构弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG报告作为评估企业ESG表现的核心媒介，由于幻灯片式的不规则布局导致的混乱阅读顺序，以及冗长、弱结构化内容产生的隐含层次结构，给大规模理解带来重大挑战。

Method: 整合了基于布局流的阅读顺序建模模块、由目录锚点引导的层次感知分割，以及将视觉元素上下文转换为连贯自然语言的多模态聚合管道。

Result: 在标注基准上的广泛实验表明，Pharos-ESG始终优于专用文档解析系统和通用多模态模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态解析和层次化标注有效解决了ESG报告的结构化问题，并发布了首个大规模公开ESG报告数据集Aurora-ESG，支持金融治理和决策中的ESG整合。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Motivation: 生成式AI的成功表明明确的生成原则比复杂算法更重要，这些原则可能同样适用于大脑运作机制，对认知神经科学有重要启示。

Method: 通过分析生成式AI的成功基础，提出需要研究这些生成原则在大脑中的运作机制，并讨论机器学习对神经信息处理的五个具体启示。

Result: 识别出生成原则是AI成功的关键，而非复杂算法；提出了五个机器学习对神经科学的启示领域。

Conclusion: 神经科学可以从机器学习研究中学习很多，特别是生成原则和神经信息处理机制，这为理解大脑认知功能提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDrift是一个用于评估检测痴呆症患者日常沟通行为渐进变化的机器学习方法的合成基准，模拟60天交互日志，关注情感扁平化和语义漂移两种变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者(PLwD)的沟通行为会随时间逐渐变化，但现有计算工具很少能跟踪这种渐进性行为漂移。

Method: 基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户模型，模拟60天交互日志，注入渐进性变化（情感扁平化和语义漂移），评估多种异常检测方法（统计方法、序列模型、监督分类器）。

Result: 情感扁平化在基线变异性低的用户中可用简单统计模型检测，语义漂移需要时序建模和个性化基线。个性化分类器在所有任务中始终优于通用分类器。

Conclusion: 个性化方法对于检测痴呆症患者沟通行为变化至关重要，PersonaDrift为评估行为漂移检测方法提供了现实基准。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

TL;DR: CLOZE是一个使用大语言模型从临床笔记中自动提取医学实体并整合到分层医学本体中的零样本框架，无需额外训练或标注数据，同时保护患者隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记作为富含详细患者观察的非结构化文档，为医学本体扩展提供了有价值但未被充分利用的资源。直接利用临床笔记进行本体扩展的研究仍很有限。

Method: 利用预训练大语言模型的强大语言理解和广泛生物医学知识，自动识别疾病相关概念并捕捉复杂层次关系，采用零样本框架无需额外训练，并通过自动化移除受保护健康信息来保护患者隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明CLOZE提供了一个准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展框架。

Conclusion: CLOZE在生物医学研究和临床信息学中具有支持广泛下游应用的强大潜力。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Motivation: 为数字人工智能系统意识可能性的辩论提供结构化的分析工具，澄清不同挑战的层次和力度。

Method: 开发基于Marr层次的分析框架，将挑战按粒度层次分类，并按力度分为三个等级：对计算功能主义的挑战、实践性挑战和严格不可能性论证。

Result: 成功应用该框架分析了14个来自科学和哲学文献的典型案例，实现了对意识挑战的系统化分类。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字意识辩论提供了有价值的分析工具，能够区分不同类型的挑战并澄清其论证力度，而不直接参与辩论本身。

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs)方法，用于解决基于案例推理网络中解释可能误导的问题，通过结合案例推理模型的固有可解释性和形式化XAI的保证来生成充分条件解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于案例推理网络虽然具有'设计可解释性'，但其解释有时会误导，特别是在安全关键场景中。多个实例可能导致不同预测却具有相同解释，这限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 提出了ALE形式化方法，在实例的中间（潜在）表示上表达充分条件以暗示预测。开发了无求解器且可扩展的算法，基于三种不同范式生成ALE，并在标准图像分类和细粒度图像分类数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的可行性，展示了ALE方法能够提供更可靠和形式化的解释，解决了传统基于案例推理网络解释的误导性问题。

Conclusion: ALE方法成功结合了案例推理模型的固有可解释性和形式化XAI的保证，为基于案例推理网络提供了更可靠和形式化的解释框架，提升了在安全关键场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

TL;DR: YOFO是一种基于模板的多模态大语言模型评判方法，通过在单次前向传播中验证结构化需求来大幅提升评判速度，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评判方法面临基本权衡：让MLLM输出单一分数与其生成性质不符且限制细粒度需求理解，而自回归生成评判分析在高吞吐场景下速度过慢。

Method: 基于自回归模型，YOFO接受结构化需求模板，在单次推理步骤中通过读取每个需求关联的最终token的logits，为每个需求生成二元是/否决策。

Result: 实验显示YOFO在标准推荐数据集上达到最先进结果，支持依赖感知分析（后续判断基于先前判断），并能从后验思维链中获益。

Conclusion: YOFO在实现数量级加速的同时保持了可解释性，解决了MLLM评判中的速度与细粒度理解之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Method: 提出Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO)框架，包含元认知"Metaloop"训练机制，动态交替进行监督微调（能力扩展）和强化学习（技能精炼），自动识别弱点并进行针对性资源分配。

Result: 使用DPPO训练的视觉语言具身模型Pelican-VL 1.0相比基础模型性能提升20.3%，在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%。

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性解决数据和资源瓶颈的框架，能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一种轻量级贝叶斯增强框架，用于基于transformer的临床语言模型，旨在产生可靠、不确定性感知的预测，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但在模糊医疗案例中容易过度自信，需要校准的不确定性量化。

Method: 集成三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边际化）、置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学问答和临床预测基准测试中，持续改善校准和可信度，减少过度自信32-48%，在模拟临床环境中可预防41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效实现可靠的不确定性传播，提高医疗AI系统的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Motivation: 孟加拉国频繁洪水破坏通信系统，隔离受灾人群并阻碍应急响应，需要不依赖固定基础设施的智能自适应路由解决方案。

Method: 集成区域转发优化本地传输、信任感知逻辑绕过不合作节点、基于信任指标、剩余能量和历史交付模式的上下文驱动决策。

Result: 使用ONE模拟器配置真实移动轨迹和洪水数据的仿真显示，AZIZA在交付可靠性、能效和路由弹性方面显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: AZIZA作为可扩展和可部署框架，推进了下一代机会主义路由在传统系统经常崩溃环境中的应用。

Abstract: Opportunistic routing architectures offer a resilient communication paradigm in environments where conventional networks fail due to disrupted infrastructure, dynamic node mobility, and intermittent connectivity conditions that commonly arise during large-scale disasters. In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience. As a scalable and deployable framework, AZIZA advances the use of next-generation opportunistic routing in environments where traditional systems routinely collapse.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种最小化大型低地球轨道星座网络直径的ISL布局优化方法，在满足物理和操作约束的同时显著降低端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LEO星座的ISL布局很少优化网络直径，而传播延迟主导端到端延迟，使得总延迟与网络直径大致成正比。需要同时满足最大链路距离、视距、每卫星硬件限制和长期链路稳定性等约束。

Method: 将ISL选择和分配建模为直径最小化问题，采用局部搜索程序迭代优化拓扑，替换或增强链路以缩小直径，生成满足所有几何和硬件限制的稀疏直径感知图。

Result: 仿真表明，所提算法在不损害ISL稳定性的情况下实现了低最坏情况延迟，并实证测量了跳数与长期链路稳定性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的ISL配置满足所有约束条件，保持了跨多个轨道周期的链路稳定性，并为未来LEO网络部署提供了指导。

Abstract: End-to-end latency in large low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations is dominated by propagation delay, making total delay roughly proportional to the network diameter, the longest shortest path in hops. Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种图感知时序编码器(GATE)和混合近端策略优化(HPPO)框架，用于解决卫星边缘计算中的资源分配和服务迁移问题，以实现全球无缝服务覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着延迟敏感应用的快速发展，需要在卫星星座上部署边缘计算能力以实现真正的全球无缝服务覆盖。一方面需要高效分配有限的机载计算和通信资源，另一方面卫星轨道的动态性要求有效的服务迁移策略来维持服务连续性。

Method: 将问题建模为时空马尔可夫决策过程，提出GATE模型联合建模空间相关性和时序动态性，使用两层图卷积网络提取卫星间和用户依赖关系，使用时序卷积网络捕获短期演化。然后将时空表示输入HPPO框架，该框架具有多头部actor输出离散服务迁移决策和连续资源分配比例。

Result: 通过涉及分布在真实世界人口中心的持久性和间歇性用户的广泛仿真验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的GATE和HPPO框架能够有效解决卫星边缘计算中的资源分配和服务迁移挑战，为实现全球无缝服务覆盖提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of latency-sensitive applications has sparked renewed interest in deploying edge computing capabilities aboard satellite constellations, aiming to achieve truly global and seamless service coverage. On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation. We conduct extensive simulations involving both persistent and intermittent users distributed across real-world population centers.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一个经过验证的模型来量化光学卫星间链路中的重新瞄准延迟，该模型基于NASA和ESA任务数据，发现PAT延迟呈现多模态分布并与初始指向不确定性和光束宽度非线性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的光学卫星间链路调度方法往往忽视或过度简化PAT延迟，导致接触规划效率低下和网络容量高估。需要更精确的延迟模型来改进路由和调度算法。

Method: 基于NASA TBIRD、LLCD、DSOC和ESA月球光学通信终端的任务数据，开发了一个验证过的重新瞄准延迟量化模型，涵盖粗指向、精指向和跟踪切换过程。

Result: 研究发现PAT延迟基于先前的链路几何呈现多模态分布，并且与初始指向不确定性和光学光束宽度呈非线性比例关系。

Conclusion: 将这种延迟模型集成到路由和调度算法中，可以实现更精确的接触规划和更高的光学网络利用率，为未来大规模光学卫星网络的性能评估和算法设计提供基础。

Abstract: Free-space optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) enable high-capacity space communications but require precise Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) between links. Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks. The proposed model provides a foundation for evaluating performance and designing algorithms for future large-scale optical satellite networks.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms encounter the challenge of high overhead due to both network management and formation control requirements. In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.

Abstract: The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.
  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.
  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.

Conclusion: WAB是下一代无线网络实用且可扩展的方法，能够扩展FR2覆盖范围并克服其局限性。

Abstract: The growing demand for wireless capacity and coverage has driven research into new radio architectures and higher frequency bands. The recently standardized Wireless Access Backhaul (WAB) architecture represents a key evolution, enabling cost-effective network densification through wireless relaying. This paper presents the first experimental realization of a multi-band WAB testbed, combining an FR2 backhaul and an FR1 access link using open-source software and commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed framework validates the feasibility of end-to-end WAB operation and demonstrates its ability to extend FR2 coverage while maintaining compatibility with legacy FR1 user equipment. Experimental campaigns conducted in vehicular and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios confirm that WAB effectively mitigates the limitations of FR2 links, particularly in uplink and Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. These results highlight WAB as a practical and scalable approach for next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 6G网络面临能源效率的重大挑战，需要在满足极端服务需求的同时保持可持续性，而传统优化技术能力有限。AI可能提供自适应管理解决方案。

Method: 围绕实际用例组织调查，对每个用例检查AI技术如何促进反馈驱动的适应性和动态条件下的快速决策，并基于七个核心动态方面进行评估。

Conclusion: 确定了当前研究中的差距和未来的研究方向，强调了AI在解决6G网络能源效率挑战中的潜在作用。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is shaping up to be one of the most challenging issues for 6G networks. The reason is fairly straightforward: Networks will need to meet extreme service demands while remaining sustainable and traditional optimization techniques are too limited. With users moving, traffic swinging unpredictably and services pulling in different directions, management has to be adaptive and AI may offer a way forward. This survey looks at how well AI-based methods actually deliver on that promise. We organize the review around practical use cases. For each use case, we examine how AI techniques contribute to feedback-driven adaptability and rapid decision-making under dynamic conditions. We then evaluate them against seven central dynamic aspects that we consider unavoidable in 6G. The survey also discusses crucial tradeoffs between energy efficiency and the remaining 6G main objectives such as latency, reliability, fairness and coverage, and finally identifies gaps and future research directions.

Abstract: We study a random process over graphs inspired by the way payments are executed in the Lightning Network, the main layer-two solution on top of Bitcoin. We first prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the time it takes for a payment failure to occur, as a function of the number of nodes and the edge capacities, when the underlying graph is complete. Then, we show how such a random process is related to the edge-betweenness centrality measure and we prove upper and lower bounds for arbitrary graphs as a function of edge-betweenness and capacity. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by running extensive simulations over some classes of graphs, including snapshots of the real Lightning Network.
