### [1] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla是一个基于CARLA模拟器构建的大规模BEV感知数据集，解决了端到端自动驾驶缺乏标准化闭环测试数据的问题，提供与nuScenes兼容的格式和高质量BEV骨干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集主要来自真实世界非交互条件，仅支持开环学习，缺乏标准化大规模数据集来促进有意义的中间表示学习，导致闭环端到端模型性能落后于简单规则基线。

Method: 在CARLA模拟器中构建nuScenes风格的大规模BEV感知数据集，保持与nuScenes格式完全兼容，提供平衡的类别分布，并开发高性能BEV骨干网络。

Result: nuCarla数据集规模与nuScenes相当但类别分布更平衡，提供可直接用于闭环模拟部署的数据和模型，BEV骨干网络达到最先进的检测结果。

Conclusion: nuCarla通过提供开放基准数据和模型，显著加速了闭环端到端自动驾驶开发，为可靠和安全感知的自动驾驶研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [2] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个框架解决开放集识别中的过度自信问题，通过扰动不确定性估计和两阶段未知检测来增强已知与未知类别的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别中，当未知样本与已知类别语义相似时，特征空间中的类间重叠会导致模型对未知样本赋予过高置信度，造成误分类为已知类别，这种过度自信现象削弱了开放集识别的性能。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：基于扰动的不确定性估计模块（通过可控参数扰动生成多样化预测并量化预测不确定性）和具有不同学习分类器的未知检测模块（作为两阶段过程，利用估计的不确定性改进已知与未知类别的区分）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的框架在开放集识别性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式缓解类间重叠引起的过度自信问题，有效提升了开放集识别的性能，在多个数据集上表现出优越性。

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [3] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于少样本视频目标检测的新方法，通过对象感知的时间建模和选择性特征传播来解决时间一致性和新对象泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统目标检测方法需要大量训练数据的问题，以及在视频中检测新对象时面临的时间一致性挑战（如遮挡和外观变化）。

Method: 采用对象感知的时间建模方法，包含过滤机制来选择性传播高置信度的对象特征，实现高效特征传播并减少噪声积累。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP指标在多个数据集上显著提升：FSVOD-500提升3.7%，FSYTV-40提升5.3%，VidOR提升4.3%，VidVRD提升4.5%。1-shot、3-shot和10-shot配置也均有改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过少样本训练和聚焦特征传播，在不依赖显式对象管提案的情况下实现了鲁棒的时间一致性，显著提升了少样本视频目标检测性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [4] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流匹配的图像融合方法，通过直接概率传输从源模态到融合图像分布，解决了传统生成方法采样效率低的问题，并引入伪标签选择和融合精炼模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法依赖任务特定模型，训练成本高且扩展性有限；生成方法虽然提供统一建模视角，但采样轨迹复杂导致推理速度慢。

Method: 采用流匹配范式改进采样效率，收集多个SOTA模型的融合结果作为先验，使用任务感知选择函数选择可靠伪标签，引入融合精炼模块分解和增强退化组件，在多任务场景中集成弹性权重巩固和经验回放机制。

Result: 在多种融合任务中达到竞争性性能，显著提高采样效率，保持轻量级模型设计。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态图像融合提供了一种高效统一的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了采样效率。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [5] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段无轨迹碰撞检测框架，使用扩散模型生成合理的未来路段地图，并通过比较监控地图与生成地图来检测碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决轨迹获取和车辆跟踪的局限性，直接使用记录个体级交通动态数据的路段地图进行碰撞检测，实现实时碰撞检测以制定主动安全管理策略。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于扩散的路段地图生成模型Mapfusion，通过噪声到正常的过程逐步添加噪声，利用时序嵌入组件捕捉路段地图序列的时间动态，并通过ControlNet整合背景上下文。第二阶段通过比较监控路段地图与扩散模型生成的地图来检测碰撞。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在准确检测碰撞方面有效，为实时碰撞检测提供了一种新的轨迹自由解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [6] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADATG方法，通过希尔伯特编码和自适应双网格训练策略，专门处理地震数据的高低频特征，提升视觉地震基础模型的预训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉transformer在处理地震数据时，由于序列化标记忽略了固有模式，无法有效捕捉地震数据中的高频和低频信息。地震数据的特殊性需要专门的处理技术。

Method: 采用频谱分解分离高低频成分，使用分层希尔伯特编码有效表示数据，并提出自适应训练策略：先关注粗粒度信息，再逐步细化到细粒度特征。

Result: 广泛实验证明了该训练方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于地震图像高低频特征的数据编码和训练策略的重要性，有助于增强视觉地震基础模型的预训练效果。

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [7] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于面部微动态时间序列分析的被动式痴呆筛查方法，无需语言或文本，仅通过分析面部运动学特征（眨眼动态、嘴部运动、注视变化等）进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有痴呆筛查方法依赖语音或脚本化访谈，限制了在临床外的应用，且预测结果与语言和转录耦合。本文旨在开发一种无需语言、可大规模应用的被动式筛查方法。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，将微运动转换为可解释的面部微动态时间序列，平滑处理后提取短窗口统计特征，分析各运动通道的活动分布而非幅度。

Result: 在YT DemTalk数据集上，注视不稳定性和嘴部/颌骨动态是最具信息量的线索，轻量级分类器达到AUROC 0.953、AP 0.961、F1分数0.851、准确率0.857。

Conclusion: 面部微动态分析为语言无关的痴呆筛查提供了有效方法，可在无临床干预的情况下进行大规模应用，且性能优异。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [8] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe是一个新的视觉推理基准测试框架，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度和24个子任务，首次量化评估视频模型作为推理器的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注保真度或对齐度，无法评估链式帧推理能力，阻碍了对模型核心认知能力的系统理解和改进指导。

Method: 基于认知科学和实际AI应用，通过多源数据整理、最小提示协议和混合VLM辅助评估，对链式帧推理进行六个认知维度的分解评估。

Result: 实验显示SOTA系统在视觉质量和实际推理深度之间存在显著差距，建立了基准和诊断工具来推进真正的世界模拟器发展。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe为视频模型作为推理器的能力提供了首个定量评估，揭示了当前模型推理能力的局限性，为开发更强大的世界模拟器提供了指导。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [9] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于排序的损失函数来解决热图式人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题，包括MSE损失的局限性、热图的空间和类别不平衡问题，以及损失函数与评估指标之间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图式人体姿态估计方法存在三个主要问题：MSE损失无法有效提升关节定位精度，热图存在空间和类别不平衡，以及损失函数与mAP评估指标不一致。

Method: 提出基于排序的损失函数，通过理论分析和实证研究证明这些损失函数优于常用的热图损失（MSE、KL散度）。该方法提高了置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性。

Result: 在COCO-val数据集上，RSPose使用ViTPose-H模型达到了79.9 mAP，超越了之前的最先进方法。同时将SimCC Resnet-50在COCO-val上的AP提高了1.5，达到73.6 AP。

Conclusion: 这是首个提出与mAP评估指标对齐的损失函数的人体姿态估计工作，在多个数据集和不同热图维度上都表现出有效性。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [10] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出碰撞声源分割任务(CS3)，通过音频条件在视频中分割产生碰撞声音的物体，针对第一人称视角视频的挑战，利用基础模型和手持物体线索实现弱监督分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，特别是通过声音识别物体交互属性的能力，希望解决碰撞声音与视觉物体之间的对应关系问题。

Method: 使用弱监督的音频条件分割方法，结合CLIP和SAM2基础模型，并融入第一人称视角特有的手持物体线索来识别可能的碰撞声源。

Result: 在两个新基准数据集EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上，分别比竞争基线方法在mIoU指标上提升了3倍和4.7倍。

Conclusion: 提出的CS3任务和方法能够有效解决碰撞声音与视觉物体之间的对应分割问题，特别是在第一人称视角的复杂场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [11] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何基础的位置回归方法GRR，通过预测解耦的几何表示（射线方向和点图）来估计相机位姿，在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统绝对位置回归(APR)方法作为黑盒直接回归6自由度位姿，容易记忆训练视图而非理解3D场景几何。需要一种更几何化的替代方案。

Method: 将APR重新表述为几何表示回归(GRR)，从图像直接回归3D几何表示：预测解耦的射线方向（估计旋转）和对应点图（估计平移），然后通过可微分确定性求解器恢复最终位姿。

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了建模逆渲染过程是通向泛化绝对位姿估计的更鲁棒路径。

Conclusion: 通过将学习到的视觉到几何映射与最终位姿计算分离的解耦方法，在网络中引入了强大的几何先验，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

*Xueyang Li,Zongren Wang,Yuliang Zhang,Zixuan Pan,Yu-Jen Chen,Nishchal Sapkota,Gelei Xu,Danny Z. Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了H-CNN-ViT模型用于膀胱癌复发预测，该模型通过分层门控注意力机制融合CNN和ViT的特征，在多序列MRI数据集上达到78.6%的AUC，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膀胱癌复发率高达78%，术后监测至关重要。多序列增强MRI是常用检测手段，但术后组织变化使判读困难。缺乏专用数据集阻碍了AI辅助诊断工具的发展。

Method: 构建专用多序列多模态MRI数据集，提出H-CNN-ViT模型：采用分层门控注意力多分支架构，独立处理各模态，通过门控机制选择性加权全局(ViT)和局部(CNN)路径特征，实现针对性特征融合。

Result: 在自建数据集上评估，H-CNN-ViT达到78.6%的AUC，超越了现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 成功构建了膀胱癌复发预测专用数据集，提出的H-CNN-ViT模型通过平衡的特征融合策略，在复发预测任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

### [13] [QwenCLIP: Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via LLM Embeddings and Prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13876)
*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP是一个视觉语言框架，用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块替换CLIP的文本编码器，通过可学习提示增强跨模态对齐，解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的文本编码器只能处理最多77个token，限制了其在信息丰富的长放射学报告中的表示能力。现有的领域特定编码器虽然有所改进，但仍受限于512token的输入长度和相对浅层的语义理解。

Method: 用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块（如Qwen3-Embedding）替换CLIP的文本编码器，引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐，利用LLM的扩展上下文窗口和更丰富的表示能力。

Result: QwenCLIP能够从长格式临床文本中捕获全面的医学语义，显著改善了医学图像-文本对齐和在放射学基准测试中的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的优势，QwenCLIP有效解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理上的限制，为医学视觉语言任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Motivation: 现有数字血液病理学方法（单任务、视觉语言、WSI优化或单细胞血液学模型）无法提供统一的、多任务、多模态的推理能力来应对数字血液病理学的复杂性。

Method: 基于Hema-Former多模态模块构建，在46个公开数据集（超过70万张图像和2.1万个问答对）上训练，整合检测、分类、分割、形态预测、掩码语言建模和视觉问答等任务。

Conclusion: 该框架为多任务和多模态数字血液病理学建立了新标准，代码将公开。

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于压缩视频流中运动向量的可扩展框架，用于评估生成视频的时间真实性，通过计算真实视频与生成视频运动向量统计量的差异来量化运动质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频模型在时间真实性方面存在明显弱点，大多数评估指标主要关注空间外观，对运动的敏感性有限。

Method: 从H.264和HEVC等压缩视频流中提取运动向量，计算真实视频与生成视频运动向量统计量的KL、JS和Wasserstein散度，并探索运动向量与RGB的融合方法。

Result: 实验发现生成视频与真实视频在运动模式上存在系统性差异，Pika和SVD在熵基散度上最接近真实视频，VC2和Text2Video-Zero在MV-sum统计上表现最佳，CogVideo在所有指标上偏差最大。融合运动向量显著提高了下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 压缩域运动向量为诊断生成视频运动缺陷和增强判别模型的时间推理提供了有效的时序信号。

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCVT研究过于关注精度而忽视实时性和可扩展性，这在城市规模应用中尤为重要，因为摄像头数量增加会带来挑战。

Method: 系统包含边缘设备和中央工作站。边缘端处理RTSP视频流，进行目标检测、跟踪、地理映射和特征提取，仅传输轻量级元数据；中央端基于自监督相机链接模型计算跨摄像头关联。

Result: 在RoundaboutHD数据集上，SAE-MCVT能在2K 15FPS视频流上保持实时操作，IDF1得分达到61.2。

Conclusion: 这是首个适合城市规模部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，解决了现有方法在实时性和可扩展性方面的不足。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

Motivation: 发现基于强化学习的CoT推理在视觉定位任务中会随着输出变长或复杂而性能下降，且数据集规模增加并不总能提升性能，因此需要更有效的训练策略。

Method: 提出Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO)，使用CoT长度和广义交并比奖励作为复杂度指标，从简单到困难逐步组织训练数据。

Conclusion: CuRPO是一种高效且鲁棒的训练策略，特别适用于具有模糊复杂文本描述的视觉定位任务，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Conclusion: 这种方法为实现数据高效和领域无关的预训练策略提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Conclusion: 通过抽象出指示人类技能的共享行为，所提出的视频表示比现有技术泛化能力更强，丰富了当今的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: RISE是首个基于单静态雷达的室内场景理解基准系统，通过利用多径反射的几何线索，实现了布局重建和物体检测，在保护隐私的同时解决了传统光学传感器的遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景理解中光学传感器的遮挡问题和隐私风险，同时利用毫米波雷达的穿透性和隐私保护特性，但其低空间分辨率限制了可靠的几何推理。

Method: 提出双角度多径增强方法，显式建模到达角和离开角来恢复次级反射；采用仿真到现实的层次扩散框架，将碎片化的雷达响应转换为完整的布局重建和物体检测。

Result: 在布局重建方面，将Chamfer距离降低了60%（降至16厘米）；实现了首个基于毫米波的物体检测，达到58% IoU；构建了包含5万帧数据的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: RISE为使用单静态雷达实现几何感知和隐私保护的室内场景理解建立了新的基础。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

TL;DR: 开发了一个2.5D上下文感知模型，用于自动识别MRI切片的解剖平面方向（轴向、冠状面、矢状面），准确率达到99.49%，比2D模型减少60%错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI切片缺少平面方向元数据会复杂化分析、增加领域偏移并降低诊断分类器准确性。

Method: 采用2.5D上下文感知模型，利用多切片信息避免孤立切片的歧义，在3D切片序列和静态2D图像上进行训练。

Result: 2.5D模型准确率达99.49%，比2D参考模型(98.74%)提升显著；在脑肿瘤检测任务中，通过门控策略使用元数据增强预测，准确率从97.0%提升至98.0%，误诊减少33.3%。

Conclusion: 2.5D上下文对MRI平面方向识别至关重要，生成的元数据能显著提升下游诊断任务的性能，模型已集成到开源交互式Web应用中。

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

TL;DR: LINGUAL框架通过自然语言指令和上下文学习，将医学图像分割任务转化为可执行程序，显著减少专家标注工作量约80%，在主动领域自适应任务中达到或超越传统主动学习基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习在医学图像分割中面临模糊边界标注困难、认知负荷高的问题，且标注工作量与ROI大小直接相关。语言指导提供了一种替代方案，能够绕过精确边界描绘的认知需求。

Method: LINGUAL框架接收专家的自然语言指令，通过上下文学习将其转化为可执行程序，自动执行相应的子任务序列，无需人工干预。

Result: 在主动领域自适应任务中，LINGUAL达到或超越了传统主动学习基线的性能，同时将估计的标注时间减少了约80%。

Conclusion: 语言指导的主动学习框架LINGUAL能够有效减少医学图像分割中的专家标注负担，在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

TL;DR: WaRPAD是一种无需训练的AI生成图像检测方法，利用自监督模型对图像裁剪增强的鲁棒性，通过分析图像嵌入对高频扰动的敏感性来检测AI生成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉生成模型的快速发展，AI生成图像检测变得至关重要。传统方法需要针对特定数据集训练检测器，而本研究探索一种无需训练的方法，利用自监督模型无需先验数据知识即可进行检测。

Method: WaRPAD首先定义基础评分函数，量化图像嵌入对通过Haar小波分解提取的高频方向扰动的敏感性。为了模拟对裁剪增强的鲁棒性，将图像缩放到模型输入大小的倍数，分割成小块，计算每个块的基础评分，最终通过平均所有块的评分得到检测分数。

Result: 在真实数据集和23种不同生成模型生成的图像上验证，WaRPAD始终实现竞争性性能，并对测试时损坏表现出强鲁棒性。该方法可应用于各种自监督模型。

Conclusion: WaRPAD提供了一种有效且无需训练的AI生成图像检测解决方案，利用自监督模型对RandomResizedCrop增强的不变性，在不同分辨率和领域的图像上表现出色。

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成方面显示出潜力，但在图像编辑中面临条件控制弱、效率低的问题，导致指令遵循差和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，包含两个关键组件：压缩语义预填充（将高级语义编码为紧凑前缀）和语义对齐指导（在解码过程中对齐视觉隐藏状态与目标语义）。

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成基准测试中实现了卓越的视觉保真度和语义对齐，优于先前的基于自回归的方法，同时保持可控性。

Conclusion: SCAR方法克服了现有自回归模型在图像编辑中的语义限制和高成本问题，为自回归模型在图像编辑任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

TL;DR: CORE是一种新的视觉token压缩方法，通过对象分割生成语义先验，将视觉token合并为紧凑的对象中心表示，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，现有token压缩方法缺乏高层语义理解，导致次优合并、信息冗余或上下文丢失。

Method: 使用高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，指导视觉token合并为对象中心表示；采用质心引导排序机制恢复合并token的空间顺序。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中达到固定率压缩的最新水平，在自适应率设置下实现显著效率提升；即使仅保留2.2%视觉token，仍能维持97.4%的基线性能。

Conclusion: 对象中心表示在高效和有效的LVLM处理中具有优越性，CORE为视觉token压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

Conclusion: 该工作为AI辅助诊断工具的开发部署开辟了新途径，特别适用于数据极度有限的罕见疾病场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

TL;DR: 提出了DEER-3D框架，通过错误驱动的3D场景编辑来生成精确的视觉反事实，解决3D-LLMs在空间定位方面的偏差问题，显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D-LLMs在将语言准确定位到3D环境中的视觉和空间元素方面存在限制，这源于训练数据侧重于语言推理而非空间理解，且缺乏3D资源导致固有的定位偏差未解决。

Method: 引入DEER-3D框架，采用"分解、诊断评估、编辑和重新训练"的工作流程。当识别到3D-LLM的定位失败时，首先诊断具体的谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后执行最小化的、与谓词对齐的3D场景编辑（如重新着色或重新定位），生成有针对性的反事实监督进行迭代模型微调。

Result: 在多个3D定位和场景理解任务的基准测试中评估编辑流程，通过迭代精炼在所有评估数据集上一致显示出改进。

Conclusion: DEER-3D强调了有针对性的、错误驱动的场景编辑在弥合3D LLMs中语言推理能力与空间定位之间差距的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BCE3S方法，使用二元交叉熵进行三元协同学习，解决长尾识别中特征紧凑性和类别分离性的问题，在多个长尾数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵损失的长尾识别方法存在两个问题：难以学习具有理想特性的特征，以及在Softmax分母中耦合了不平衡的分类器向量，放大了长尾识别中的不平衡效应。

Method: BCE3S包含三个组件：1) 基于BCE的联合学习优化分类器和样本特征；2) 基于BCE的对比学习进一步提高特征的类内紧凑性；3) 基于BCE的均匀学习平衡分类器向量间的分离性。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist2018等长尾数据集上实现了SOTA性能，同时获得了更高的特征紧凑性和分离性。

Conclusion: BCE3S方法通过三元协同学习有效解决了长尾识别中的特征学习和分类器平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化图像修复方法依赖任务特定设计或潜在路由策略，难以适应现实世界中复杂的多种退化情况，需要更统一和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 使用冻结MLLM作为规划器分析退化图像并生成频率感知修复计划，通过LoRA-MoE模块在扩散执行器中动态选择高频/低频专家，结合对抗训练和频率正则化损失提升质量。

Result: 在七个修复任务上达到最先进性能，在混合退化情况下表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将语义规划与基于频率的修复相结合，FAPE-IR为一体化图像修复提供了统一且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要用户提供精确的空间位置和时间边界描述，但在用户通过语义属性或对象关系的隐式查询来构思编辑时，这些要求变得不切实际。

Method: RIVER通过数字孪生表示解耦推理和生成，使用大语言模型进行多跳推理生成结构化指令，然后指导基于扩散的编辑器执行像素级修改。训练采用强化学习，奖励评估推理准确性和生成质量。

Result: RIVER在提出的RVEBenchmark上表现最佳，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个额外视频编辑基准上达到最先进性能，超越了六个基线方法。

Conclusion: RIVER成功解决了推理视频编辑任务，能够理解隐式查询并通过多跳推理执行视频编辑，为复杂视频编辑场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有单目深度估计模型计算资源消耗大，虽然有些方法减小了模型规模但性能下降严重，阻碍了在自动驾驶和机器人导航中的实际部署。

Method: 基于Lite-Encoder的编码器和多尺度稀疏融合框架的解码器架构，最小化冗余同时确保性能和推理速度。

Conclusion: RTS-Mono在保持高性能的同时实现了实时推理，为自监督单目深度估计在真实世界部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最优传输聚合方法对称处理源和目标边缘分布，当图像特征和聚类中心分布差异显著时效果受限，需要非对称匹配机制。

Method: 采用行-列归一化平均和分离边缘校准实现非对称匹配，通过可学习坐标嵌入融合几何约束与特征相似性，促进空间邻近特征分配到同一聚类。

Result: 在MSLS、NordLand和Pittsburgh数据集上的实验结果表明性能优越，验证了该方法在提高匹配准确性和鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: A²GC-VPR方法通过非对称聚合和几何约束有效解决了视觉位置识别中的分布不匹配问题，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在微调时学习不需要概念的问题，这对于偏见缓解、防止恶意适应、属性解缠等下游任务至关重要。

Method: 使用语言描述来指定不希望学习的概念，通过防止用户提示的嵌入与不希望的概念对齐来正则化适应过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，Coffee能够有效防止文本到图像模型在微调过程中学习指定的不希望概念，并且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Coffee提供了一种灵活可控的微调方法，通过简单的文本描述修改就能调整不希望学习的概念，在防止不需要概念学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人-车辆事故是城市安全的关键挑战，现有视频系统只能检测事故发生，无法分析行为认知阶段。视觉语言模型在视频理解方面有潜力，但缺乏显式时间结构和多视角整合。

Method: 基于两个专门视觉语言模型：TG-VLM用于行为阶段分割，PhaVR-VLM用于阶段感知多视角分析，最后使用大语言模型生成综合报告。

Result: TG-VLM在行为阶段分割上达到mIoU=0.4881，PhaVR-VLM在字幕生成得分33.063，问答准确率最高达64.70%。

Conclusion: MP-PVIR能有效将多视角视频数据转化为可操作的见解，推进车辆-基础设施协同系统中AI驱动的交通安全分析。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管卷积神经网络和Transformer重塑了计算机视觉，但这两类架构通常被视为根本不同的。作者认为卷积和自注意力尽管表面差异明显，但可以在统一的k近邻聚合框架下进行统一。

Method: 引入卷积最近邻(ConvNN)框架，将卷积和注意力形式化为邻居选择操作：卷积基于空间邻近性选择邻居，注意力基于特征相似性选择邻居。该框架可作为卷积层和注意力层的即插即用替代品。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100分类任务上验证了框架的有效性：VGG中的混合分支结合空间邻近性和特征相似性选择提高了两个数据集的准确率；ViT中的ConvNN优于标准注意力和其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一框架，消除了卷积和注意力之间的明显区别，对设计更有原则性和可解释性的视觉架构具有重要意义。

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Motivation: 现有视频时刻检索方法主要依赖粗粒度时间理解和单一视觉模态，在复杂视频中性能受限，需要更精细的多模态融合方法。

Method: 提出SMART框架，整合音频和视觉特征，应用Shot-aware Token Compression选择性保留高信息量token以减少冗余，同时优化提示设计以更好利用音频-视觉线索。

Conclusion: SMART通过音频增强和镜头感知的token压缩，有效提升了视频时刻检索的精度，证明了多模态融合和精细时间建模的重要性。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Conclusion: iGaussian通过前馈框架实现了实时相机姿态估计，在精度和速度方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

Method: RiSe框架包含两个组件：AsyIRM在径向空间学习不变球形决策边界以适应非对称分布，MMSD通过跨样本混合和解耦增强内在、可泛化的模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证了RiSe的有效性，在跨域性能上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: RiSe框架成功解决了多模态人脸反欺骗中的跨域泛化挑战，通过处理表征和协同不变性风险显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

TL;DR: MVI-Bench是首个专门评估误导性视觉输入如何削弱大型视觉语言模型鲁棒性的综合基准，包含1,248个专家标注的VQA实例，并提出了细粒度评估指标MVI-Sensitivity。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒性基准主要关注幻觉或误导性文本输入，而忽视了误导性视觉输入对视觉理解评估的同等重要挑战。

Method: 基于基础视觉原语，设计了三个层次的误导性视觉输入分类：视觉概念、视觉属性和视觉关系，并构建了六个代表性类别。

Result: 对18个最先进LVLM的实证结果揭示了它们对误导性视觉输入的显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: MVI-Bench的深入分析为开发更可靠和鲁棒的LVLM提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中图像补丁级令牌化导致的二次增长问题，该问题带来了巨大的计算和内存负担，且与传统的人类视觉认知系统不匹配，导致幻觉和计算冗余。

Method: 采用对象级令牌合并策略进行自适应令牌压缩，该方法与人类视觉系统保持一致，通过选择性压缩图像令牌来减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在多个综合基准测试中，平均仅使用10%的令牌即可达到原始模型96%的性能，在压缩比和性能平衡方面优于相关方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应令牌压缩方法有效解决了MLLMs中的计算效率问题，同时保持了良好的性能，为多模态理解提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR是一种基于博弈论的自监督对比学习框架，通过时空双权重定位机制识别关键运动区域，并使用熵驱动优势策略管理记忆库，在骨架动作识别任务中取得了state-of-the-art性能。

Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法在处理骨架数据时对所有区域一视同仁，并采用FIFO队列存储负样本，导致运动信息丢失和负样本选择不优。

Method: 提出基于博弈论的自监督框架DoGCLR，将正负样本构建建模为动态优势博弈，包含时空双权重定位机制和熵驱动优势策略。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View上达到81.1%/89.4%准确率，在NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set上达到71.2%/75.5%准确率，分别超过现有最佳方法0.1%、2.7%、1.1%和2.3%。

Conclusion: DoGCLR在多个数据集上表现出色，特别是在更具挑战性的场景中展现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Method: 构建包含380万对图像的大规模数据集，包含新颖的物理合理数据以填补公共基准的关键空白；定制训练流程，微调扩散变换器从多样化数据中学习鲁棒修复先验，集成细粒度掩码和强度控制。

Conclusion: 通过利用软效应的共同本质（半透明遮挡），UniSER证明了在单一框架内处理多种退化问题的可行性，为图像修复提供了新的基础模型方向。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分词方法使用局部监督的语义监督方式，限制了语义分布的均匀性。而VA-VAE证明更均匀的特征分布能带来更好的生成性能。

Method: 提出码本直方图关系学习方法将预训练模型在整个数据集上建模的语义转移到语义码本，并设计残差学习模块恢复量化造成的细节损失。

Result: 在标准ImageNet-1k基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的重建性能和生成质量。

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局关系建模产生了更均匀分布的语义潜在表示，有助于自回归模型生成高质量图像，且训练过程无需直接访问预训练模型。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Motivation: 现有数据集多为人工驾驶或未明确驾驶模式采集，只能用于感知预测的早期训练，无法评估自动驾驶车辆在真实环境中的行为安全。

Method: 从市场上多个量产自动驾驶车辆模型采集自然驾驶数据，分割成32,727个关键帧，每帧包含4个同步摄像头图像、高精度GNSS/IMU数据、20Hz车辆轨迹以及详细的2D标注。

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net通过统一图表示和多模态蒸馏，在有限标注数据下实现了鲁棒的精确事件检测性能。

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/LZYAndy/UMEG-Net.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24. The code for fractal softmax will be available at https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/fractal-softmax.

Conclusion: DetGain作为一种通用且互补的策略，在数据高效的目标检测方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Motivation: 现有船舶重识别方法多从行人重识别算法直接迁移而来，无法有效处理船舶图像特有的身份内变化大和局部缺失严重的问题，导致同一身份内出现异常样本。

Method: 提出多尺度相关性感知Transformer网络(MCFormer)，包含全局相关性模块(GCM)构建全局相似度亲和矩阵，以及局部相关性模块(LCM)挖掘和对齐正样本的局部特征，通过动态记忆库补偿缺失区域。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，MCFormer达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCFormer通过显式建模多尺度相关性，有效抑制了船舶重识别中异常样本的负面影响，提升了特征鲁棒性。

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的视频重建方法要么存在时间伪影，要么迭代后验采样速度太慢，无法满足实时应用需求。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时处理的方法。

Method: 将预训练的双向视频扩散模型（教师）蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，使用先验驱动的蒸馏方法，仅需教师扩散模型和已知退化算子，无需外部配对数据。采用LeanVAE替换VAE骨干网络，实现低延迟潜在空间处理。

Result: 在流式随机修复、高斯去模糊和超分辨率任务中，InstantViR匹配或超越基于扩散的基线方法的重建质量，在NVIDIA A100 GPU上运行速度超过35 FPS，比迭代视频扩散求解器快100倍。

Conclusion: 基于扩散的视频重建可以与实时、交互式、可编辑的流式场景兼容，使高质量视频恢复成为现代视觉系统的实用组件。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Abstract: We introduce Orion, a visual agent framework that can take in any modality and generate any modality. Using an agentic framework with multiple tool-calling capabilities, Orion is designed for visual AI tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Unlike traditional vision-language models that produce descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, including object detection, keypoint localization, panoptic segmentation, Optical Character Recognition, and geometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance on MMMU, MMBench, DocVQA, and MMLongBench while extending monolithic vision-language models to production-grade visual intelligence. By combining neural perception with symbolic execution, Orion enables autonomous visual reasoning, marking a transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种测量约束采样(MCS)方法，用于盲人脸恢复(BFR)任务，能够根据不同的文本提示生成多样化的高质量人脸重建结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的盲人脸恢复方法通常产生确定性结果，难以捕捉极端低质量输入下可能对应多个合理高质量重建的"一对多"特性。

Method: 将BFR构建为测量约束的生成任务，通过粗恢复的受控退化构建逆问题，在文本到图像扩散中进行后验引导采样，包含前向测量和反向测量约束。

Result: 实验表明MCS能够生成与提示对齐的结果，并且在性能上优于现有的BFR方法。

Conclusion: MCS方法成功解决了盲人脸恢复中的一对多问题，能够根据文本提示生成多样化且高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法一次性处理整个音频序列，在处理超出训练范围的音频时性能下降，且长音频输入会产生显著延迟。

Method: 采用自回归扩散模型，选择有限数量的历史帧作为运动上下文，与音频输入结合形成动态条件，引导扩散过程迭代生成面部运动帧。

Result: 实现了灵活处理不同长度音频的能力，获得与音频时长无关的低延迟，生成了高质量的面部动画结果。

Conclusion: 提出的流式处理方法有效解决了长音频序列处理问题，实现了实时高质量的3D面部动画合成。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Motivation: 当前方法过度依赖网络对时空关系的隐式建模，陷入被动学习陷阱，导致冗余和单调的3D坐标信息获取，缺乏主动引导的显式学习机制。

Method: 设计了数据感知模块将姿态投影到商空间，解耦运动几何与坐标冗余；引入网络感知模块通过恢复性学习主动学习时空依赖关系；采用辅助学习网络从扰动信息中学习。

Result: 在H3.6M、CMU Mocap和3DPW数据集上分别实现了16.3%、13.9%和10.1%的性能提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: APS方法能够有效增强运动预测的主动感知能力，具有模型无关性，可以集成到不同的预测模型中提升性能。

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed通过利用基础模型指导轻量级客户端，有效解决了联邦半监督学习中的伪标签质量和模型异构性问题，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅的低秩张量表示框架(GSLR)，用于多维图像的紧凑连续表示，解决了传统t-SVD方法在捕捉局部高频信息方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统张量奇异值分解(t-SVD)方法存在两个关键限制：(1)潜在张量近似粗糙，无法准确捕捉空间局部高频信息；(2)变换矩阵由固定基原子组成，无法精确捕捉mode-3纤维方向的局部高频信息。

Method: 使用定制的2D高斯泼溅生成潜在张量，1D高斯泼溅生成变换矩阵。这两种高斯泼溅在该表示框架中相互补充，具有强大的表示能力，特别擅长捕捉局部高频信息。

Result: 在多维图像恢复任务上的大量实验表明，GSLR始终优于最先进的方法，特别是在捕捉局部高频信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: GSLR框架通过高斯泼溅技术有效解决了传统t-SVD方法的局限性，为多维图像提供了紧凑且连续的表示方法，在局部高频信息捕捉方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: VLM3D为将VLM丰富的语言基础语义和空间理解注入多样化3D生成管线提供了原则性和可泛化的路径。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Objective assessment of eyelid movements remains challenging due to the complexity, cost, and limited clinical applicability of existing tools. This study presents the clinical validation of Bapp (Blink Application), a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework and integrated with Google ML Kit for on-device, real-time analysis of eyelid movements. The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对自动驾驶中立体匹配模型的纹理化物理对抗攻击，使用3D全局伪装纹理而非局部2D补丁，确保立体相机不同视角下的视觉一致性和攻击有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击多采用2D补丁且主要针对单目感知，立体双目深度估计中物理对抗样本的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用3D物理对抗样本与全局伪装纹理，提出3D立体匹配渲染模块处理相机视差效应，并设计新颖的融合攻击通过细粒度优化将目标无缝融入环境。

Result: 广泛评估表明，该方法能成功欺骗立体模型产生错误的深度信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在立体视觉系统中实现了视觉一致且有效的物理对抗攻击，显著提升了现有隐藏攻击的隐蔽性和杀伤力。

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

TL;DR: 提出NeuralBoneReg，一种自监督、基于表面的框架，使用3D点云作为模态无关表示来配准骨表面，在计算机辅助骨科手术中实现跨模态的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机辅助骨科手术中，术前和术中数据的模态异质性使得配准具有挑战性且容易出错，因此需要稳健、自动且模态无关的骨表面配准方法。

Method: 包括两个模块：学习术前骨模型的隐式神经无符号距离场（UDF），以及执行全局初始化和局部细化的基于MLP的配准模块，通过生成变换假设将术中点云与神经UDF对齐。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的评估显示，NeuralBoneReg在所有数据集上均匹配或超越现有方法，在UltraBones100k上达到平均RRE/RTE为1.68°/1.86 mm，在UltraBones-Hip上为1.88°/1.89 mm，在SpineDepth上为3.79°/2.45 mm。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了该方法在解剖结构和模态间的强泛化能力，为CAOS提供了稳健和准确的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: AVI框架在无需专有API或RL训练的情况下，实现了高效且可解释的视频理解，为复杂视频推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Motivation: 多源静态CT在时间敏感应用中具有优势，但超稀疏视角采样会显著降低重建质量，传统方法在此条件下表现不佳。

Method: 使用神经衰减场表示，结合角度先验引导的投影合成策略和扩散驱动的重用投影优化模块，通过迭代方式逐步提升投影完整性和重建质量。

Result: 在多个模拟3D CT体积和真实投影数据上的实验表明，Diff-NAF在超稀疏视角条件下实现了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Diff-NAF框架通过迭代优化有效解决了超稀疏视角多源静态CT的重建挑战，能够产生高质量的CT重建结果。

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Method: 提出几何感知配对策略(GAPS)选择高价值图像对，然后使用小波正则化目标训练3D高斯溅射模型，通过离散小波变换保持频带保真度。

Conclusion: Dental3R为远程正畸提供了一种稳健、高保真的3D重建解决方案，能够从稀疏口腔照片中保留关键诊断细节。

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有WMH分割方法大多只提供全局病灶负荷，忽视了不同白质区域的病灶空间分布差异，而区域分布对神经退行性疾病的诊断具有重要价值。

Method: 开发深度学习框架进行WMH分割和定位，在公共数据集和ADNI队列中评估，并量化解剖定义区域内的WMH负荷，结合脑结构体积评估诊断价值。

Result: 区域WMH体积在疾病分类中始终优于全局病灶负荷，与脑萎缩指标结合后性能进一步提升，AUC最高达0.97。前部白质束等特定区域与诊断状态可重复相关。

Conclusion: 区域WMH量化具有附加价值，将局部病灶指标与萎缩标志物结合可增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和分层能力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

Result: 在34个专家标注的临床病例上评估，显著减少了标志点误差（特别是后牙区域），在下颌骨上获得更紧密的分散度，在曲线级别获得低Chamfer距离和可控的Hausdorff距离。

Conclusion: DentalSCR能够稳健处理真实世界头颅X光片，提供高保真度、临床可检查的3D-2D对齐，优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

*Hoang Chuong Nguyen,Wei Mao,Jose M. Alvarez,Miaomiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Image-Based Gaussian Splatting方法，通过结合标准3DGS渲染的基础颜色和从训练图像学习的残差，显著提升渲染质量，特别是高频细节和视角相关效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法使用低阶球谐函数限制了捕捉空间变化颜色和视角相关效果的能力，而现有增强方法要么使用全局纹理图（复杂场景效果差），要么使用逐高斯纹理图（存储开销大）。

Method: 将每个像素颜色建模为标准3DGS渲染的基础颜色与从邻近训练图像推断的学习残差的组合，利用高分辨率源图像进行精细细节和视角特定颜色建模。

Result: 在标准NVS基准测试中，该方法在渲染质量上显著优于先前的Gaussian Splatting方法，且不增加存储占用。

Conclusion: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting提供了一种高效的替代方案，能够渲染高频细节和准确的视角相关效果，同时保持存储效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

TL;DR: 提出JFD3框架，联合特征域去模糊与检测，通过双分支架构和特征一致性监督提升红外无人机模糊目标的检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外无人机目标图像常因快速传感器移动而产生运动模糊，降低目标与背景对比度。现有方法将去模糊作为预处理步骤，忽视了检测任务相关特征的增强

Method: 设计权重共享的双分支架构，清晰分支指导模糊分支；引入轻量级特征恢复网络，使用清晰分支特征作为监督；提出频率结构引导模块，将结构先验整合到浅层检测层；施加特征一致性自监督损失

Result: 在IRBlurUAV基准测试上，JFD3实现了优越的检测性能，同时保持实时效率

Conclusion: JFD3框架通过联合特征域去模糊和检测，有效提升了红外无人机模糊目标的检测能力，为相关应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

*Alfonso Pedro Ridao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种肩部姿态评估算法，用于自动评估生物特征证件照片中肩部姿态的合规性，该算法仅使用两个肩部标志点的3D坐标来量化肩部偏转和旋转角度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际生物特征证件标准要求严格符合姿态要求，包括肩部正面展示，但现有自动质量评估文献缺乏针对这一具体属性的定量评估方法。

Method: 使用常见姿态估计框架提供的两个肩部标志点的3D坐标，量化肩部偏转和旋转角度，开发肩部姿态评估算法。

Result: 在121张肖像图像数据集上评估，SPE得分与人工标注标签显示出强皮尔逊相关性（r≈0.80），通过改进的错误-丢弃方法分析确认了其在识别不合规样本方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法是注册系统中自动合规检查的可行轻量级工具。

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的驾驶代理缺乏强制执行交通规则的机制，且难以可靠检测小型安全关键物体（如交通灯和标志）。

Method: 引入TLS-Assist框架，将交通灯和标志检测转换为结构化自然语言消息，注入LLM输入中，强制关注安全关键提示。该框架是即插即用、模型无关的，支持单视图和多视图相机设置。

Result: 在CARLA的LangAuto基准测试中，相比LMDrive和BEVDriver，驾驶性能分别提升14%和7%，同时持续减少交通灯和标志违规。

Conclusion: TLS-Assist有效增强了LLM驾驶代理的安全性和可靠性，通过显式关注交通规则关键元素来改善自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0是一个新的3D人体运动数据集，相比BEDLAM数据集在相机运动、人体形状、动作、服装、头发、3D环境和鞋子等方面增加了多样性和真实性，特别适用于训练世界坐标系下的人体运动估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视频中推断3D人体运动是一个具有挑战性的问题，许多应用需要估计世界坐标系中的人体运动，这在人体和相机同时运动时尤其困难。该领域进展受到缺乏具有真实人体和相机运动标注的丰富视频数据的限制。

Method: 开发了BEDLAM2.0数据集，通过引入更多样化和真实的相机及相机运动，增加人体形状、动作、服装、头发和3D环境的多样性和真实性，并添加了BEDLAM中缺失的鞋子元素。

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0是一个比BEDLAM更好的数据集，特别适用于训练估计世界坐标系中人体运动的方法，为研究提供了渲染视频、真实身体参数和相机运动数据。

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

TL;DR: LAVA提出了一种新的领域增量学习框架，使用基于文本的参考锚点进行相对对齐，解决了现有方法在统一视觉空间和隔离域特定参数之间的两难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域增量学习方法面临基本困境：统一视觉空间会导致域间干扰和语义扭曲，而隔离域特定参数会造成知识碎片化，形成阻碍知识重用的"知识孤岛"。

Method: LAVA使用语言锚定的视觉对齐方法，通过基于文本的参考锚点驱动相对对齐，引导每个传入域的视觉表示保持一致的相对几何结构，该结构由类名之间的成对语义相似度定义。

Result: 在标准领域增量学习基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LAVA相比最先进方法实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的相对对齐方法有效解决了领域增量学习中的知识保留和域间干扰问题，为跨域知识重用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Motivation: 探索婴儿阶段性视觉发展（低清晰度、颜色退化、时间连续性）在机器学习中的生态优势，为理解稳健视觉智能的出现提供逆向工程框架。

Method: 使用CATDiet方法训练自监督学习模型，包括灰度到彩色(C)、模糊到清晰(A)、保持时间连续性(T)三个约束条件，并在CombDiet中先用CATDiet初始化再进行标准训练。

Result: 所有CATDiet变体在物体识别中表现出增强的鲁棒性，模型显示出与生物对齐的发展模式，包括类似猕猴V1区突触密度的神经可塑性变化和类似婴儿视觉悬崖反应的行为。CombDiet在物体识别和深度感知任务上优于标准自监督学习。

Conclusion: 婴儿早期视觉经验的发展进程为理解机器中稳健视觉智能的出现提供了强大的逆向工程框架，阶段性视觉饮食能有效提升模型的鲁棒性和生物合理性。

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Conclusion: CompEvent通过全流程时空融合和复数神经网络的全息表示能力，显著增强了低光视频去模糊能力。

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

Conclusion: 残差-先验设计结合物理约束，产生了空间连贯、物理合理的冰床地形，适用于领域偏移下的操作制图。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD)框架，利用视觉语言模型增强端到端自动驾驶系统的泛化能力，通过RiskHead模块将风险注意力蒸馏到BEV特征中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动驾驶系统在泛化能力方面的局限性，特别是处理未见场景和不同传感器配置的能力，同时避免混合系统的不一致性和端到端解决方案的高计算成本。

Method: 引入RiskHead模块，从视觉语言模型中提取因果风险估计并蒸馏到鸟瞰图特征中，生成可解释的风险注意力图，使BEV特征学习更丰富的风险注意力表示。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，RSD在复杂和不可预测的驾驶条件下表现出色，感知和规划能力均有显著提升。

Conclusion: RSD框架通过风险注意力蒸馏有效提升了自动驾驶系统的泛化能力和人类化驾驶行为，为处理复杂动态环境提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT通过模拟人类视觉系统，有效提升了LDCT图像质量，为放射科医生提供了感知可见的关键解剖结构和病理细节。

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

Motivation: 现有的视频变分自编码器通常忽略帧内容之间的相似性，导致潜在建模冗余，需要更紧凑的潜在表示方法。

Method: 将视频内容分解为关键帧、运动和残差三个组件，为每个组件设计专用编码器，使用共享的3D解码器保持时空一致性，并采用解耦适应策略进行稳定训练。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明，DeCo-VAE在视频重建性能上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过解耦视频组件并学习专用潜在表示，DeCo-VAE能够实现更紧凑和高效的视频表征。

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了多SDF分析中的障碍，能够以更紧凑的潜在表示恢复更高保真的几何细节。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合提供了对细微伪造的卓越鲁棒性，分支协同作用得到验证，Grad-CAM确认了法医检测焦点。

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: HoloTea能够推进精确3D虚拟组织的创建，加速生物标志物发现并加深对疾病的理解。

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

Motivation: 跌倒对老年人造成严重伤害，基于视觉的跌倒预测系统因缺乏真实跌倒数据而发展受限。

Method: 使用双流Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN)，通过交叉注意力融合机制结合姿态和生物力学信息。

Result: 在模拟数据集上F1分数比基线提升5.32%和2.91%，但零样本泛化到真实场景时性能从89.0%降至35.9%。

Conclusion: 模拟数据存在偏见，需要个性化策略和隐私保护数据管道来弥合模拟-现实差距，为脆弱老年人群开发有效的跌倒预测系统。

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Conclusion: S-Net方法能够重建更准确详细的表面，同时保持高质量的新视角渲染

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SLAM-AGS是一个面向计算细胞学的多任务预训练框架，通过联合优化弱监督相似性目标和自监督对比目标，在低见证率下实现更好的下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算细胞学面临两个主要挑战：实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高，以及见证率极低。

Method: 提出SLAM-AGS框架，联合优化(i)基于切片负片块的弱监督相似性目标和(ii)基于切片正片块的自监督对比目标，使用自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，并集成到基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器中。

Result: 在公开骨髓细胞学数据集上，SLAM-AGS在袋级F1分数和Top 400阳性细胞检索方面优于其他预训练方法，特别是在低见证率下提升最明显。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰能够实现稳定的预训练和更好的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

TL;DR: RepAir是一个用于3D气道分割的三阶段框架，结合nnU-Net网络和解剖学拓扑校正，能生成更完整、解剖一致的气道树结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注气道不切实际，现有自动方法常产生不连续的分割结果，影响生物标志物提取的可靠性。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) nnU-Net网络生成初始气道掩码；2) 基于骨架的算法识别潜在不连续性并建议重新连接；3) 1D卷积分类器确定哪些候选连接对应真实解剖分支。

Result: 在两个数据集（ATM'22和AeroPath）上，RepAir在体素级和拓扑指标上均优于现有3D U-Net方法，生成更完整的气道树。

Conclusion: RepAir能够产生更完整、解剖一致的气道分割结果，同时保持高分割精度。

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Motivation: 减轻大语言模型生成文本的潜在危害，通过水印技术嵌入可检测信号，但现有技术存在影响文本质量和易受攻击的问题，阻碍了广泛应用。

Method: 评估多种水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，比较释义和回译攻击；使用语言指标评估水印文本在质量和写作风格上的保持能力。

Result: 水印技术能保持语义，但会偏离未加水印文本的写作风格，且易受对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。

Conclusion: 当前水印技术在保持语义方面表现良好，但在写作风格保持和对抗攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要改进以促进广泛应用。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联合训练质量评估系统和自动后编辑系统能提升性能，但自动后编辑系统仍存在过度修正问题，导致性能下降。本文旨在探索无需训练的解决方案。

Method: 方法一：质量评估指导的重翻译，从不同LLM生成的多个候选翻译中选择质量最高的。方法二：基于质量评估解释替换错误子串，采用条件启发式方法最小化编辑次数。

Result: 两种方法分别获得了0.0201和-0.0108的Delta COMET分数，第一种方法在子任务排行榜上获得获胜位置。

Conclusion: 质量评估指导的重翻译方法在无需训练的情况下表现优异，超过了基于质量评估解释的错误替换方法，成为获胜方案。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长范围上下文中的"迷失在中间"现象，特别是在基于检索的LLM应用中，评估控制变量检索性能。

Method: 使用GM-Extract基准数据集，采用两个评估指标（文档指标和变量提取指标），系统评估7-8B参数模型在多文档任务上的表现，并进行文献调查将缓解方法分为黑盒和白盒两类。

Result: 发现检索性能受文档表示方式显著影响，虽然未始终观察到明显的U形曲线，但模型间存在清晰的性能模式，与困惑度分数相关。缓解方法的效果复杂，有些情况下能改善性能，有些情况下会产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 长文档检索性能受多种因素影响，现有缓解方法的效果具有高度复杂性，需要在实际应用场景中谨慎评估其效用。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

Motivation: 包含最高级的搜索查询需要在多个维度比较候选结果，这需要语言理解和领域知识，现有方法难以有效处理此类语义。

Method: 将查询分解为属性-值提示，与检索过程并行生成，然后将最高级解释转移到轻量级模型中以降低延迟。

Result: 在MAP指标上提升10.9点，在MRR指标上提升5.9点，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了如何表示和传递最高级语义，在提升检索系统语言理解能力的同时解决了实际部署的延迟约束。

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害侦察报告包含理解多灾害相互作用的关键证据，但其非结构化叙述使得系统知识转移困难。LLM在缺乏领域基础时会产生不可靠或幻觉输出，需要开发能够可靠分析这些报告的方法。

Method: 提出MoRA-RAG框架，包含：1）混合检索机制，动态路由跨灾害特定数据库的查询；2）智能分块保持检索中的上下文连贯性；3）验证循环评估证据充分性、优化查询并在信息不完整时启动针对性搜索。基于GEER侦察报告构建HazardRecQA数据集。

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG为将灾后文档转化为可操作、可信赖的灾害韧性情报建立了新范式。

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

Motivation: 现有的OOC虚假信息检测方法过于强调内部一致性，而忽视了图像-文本对与外部证据之间的外部一致性的重要性。

Method: HiEAG框架将外部一致性检查分解为检索、重排序和重写的综合引擎流程，使用AESP进行证据重排序，AEGP进行证据重写，并通过指令调优实现判断解释。

Result: 在不同基准数据集上的实验结果表明，HiEAG在所有样本的准确率上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiEAG通过分层证据增强生成框架有效提升了多模态OOC虚假信息检测的性能，证明了外部一致性检查的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

Motivation: 现有的多标签情感分类数据集（如GoEmotions）存在严重的类别不平衡问题，这影响了模型性能，特别是对于代表性不足的情感类别

Method: 通过整合原始GoEmotions数据、使用RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions模型标注的Sentiment140样本以及GPT-4 mini生成的手动标注文本，构建平衡数据集；开发结合FastText嵌入、CNN、双向LSTM和注意力机制的增强模型

Result: 实验结果显示在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC方面相比不平衡数据训练的模型有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签情感分类中的类别不平衡问题，显著提高了模型性能

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: RVLMs依赖安全对齐防止有害行为，但其暴露的思维链轨迹引入了新的攻击面，需要研究如何突破这种安全机制。

Method: 使用分段级干扰引发有害推理轨迹，将自生成输出作为监督微调数据，采用轮次加权损失设计，实现轻量级、分布一致的微调方法。

Result: 仅用499个样本和单张A100显卡3小时内，攻击成功率比IDEATOR提高38.52%，同时保持通用推理能力，模型表示分布保持不变。

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning是一种低成本、高效的绕过对齐防御的方法，暴露了RVLMs安全机制的脆弱性。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

TL;DR: 提出基于数据中心的框架，通过生成高质量合成出院摘要来解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，提升罕见和零样本ICD代码的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本自动ICD编码任务受到诊断代码极端长尾分布的阻碍，数千个罕见和零样本ICD代码在数据集中严重不足，导致宏F1分数较低。

Method: 构建基于罕见代码的现实多标签代码集，利用真实世界共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类法和相似临床笔记生成结构化提示，生成90,000个合成笔记覆盖7,902个ICD代码。

Result: 在原始和扩展数据集上微调PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD模型，实验显示方法适度提高了宏F1同时保持强微F1，优于先前SOTA。

Conclusion: 精心设计的合成数据可以增强长尾ICD代码预测的公平性，尽管相对于计算成本增益可能显得边际。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的方法只能建模成对依赖关系，需要为不同关系视图构建多个图，这引入了冗余、参数开销和融合过程中的错误传播，限制了在短文本、低资源设置下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出HyperABSA动态超图框架，通过样本特定的层次聚类诱导方面-意见结构，并引入新颖的加速-回退截止机制来自适应确定聚类的粒度级别。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（Lap14、Rest14、MAMS）上的实验显示，相比强大的图基线方法取得了持续改进，特别是与RoBERTa骨干网络结合时获得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态超图构建是ABSA任务中高效且强大的替代方案，并具有扩展到其他短文本NLP任务的潜力。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效结合了动态知识图谱生成与验证，在多选题回答中实现了良好的准确率和可追溯性，但性能受问题类型影响较大。

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure.

Motivation: 解决超人类模型只能获得弱监督的问题，现有弱到强泛化方法固定使用弱监督，部分弱标签对模型有害，需要选择性使用弱监督。

Method: 训练二元分类器P(IK)识别强模型能回答的问题，使用自生成标签进行对齐，通过图平滑方法优化弱标签。

Result: 在三个基准测试中持续优于竞争基线，P(IK)能跨任务和难度泛化。

Conclusion: 选择性弱到强泛化有助于解决超对齐问题。

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

### [139] [SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14172)
*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于符号语言学知识的幻觉定位框架，通过分析模型如何处理符号触发器来追踪幻觉在模型各层的发展过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遇到符号触发器时仍存在幻觉问题，但缺乏对这些符号幻觉起源的清晰理解，需要系统性地处理这些触发器并在模型内部定位幻觉的出现位置。

Method: 利用符号语言学和语义知识构建定位框架，分析五个模型在HaluEval和TruthfulQA数据集上的表现，重点关注模型如何处理符号触发器。

Result: 发现符号语言元素的注意力方差在早期层(2-4层)爆炸性增长达到临界不稳定状态，否定触发器的方差水平尤其灾难性；尽管模型规模增大，幻觉率仍保持高位(78.3%-83.7%)，深层中符号语义触发器的注意力急剧下降。

Conclusion: 幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败，而非一般生成问题，符号语义知识为理解和定位LLMs中的幻觉机制提供了关键线索。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

*Jiajun Hou,Chenyu Zhang,Rui Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepEL是一个将大语言模型深度集成到实体链接各个阶段的框架，通过自验证机制利用全局上下文信息纠正预测，在10个基准数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只在实体链接的孤立阶段使用LLMs，未能充分利用其在整个流程中的能力，且孤立消歧无法达到最优性能。

Method: 提出DeepEL框架，将LLMs集成到实体链接的每个阶段，并引入自验证机制利用全局上下文信息来纠正预测和识别实体间的连贯关系。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上，DeepEL显著优于现有最先进方法，整体F1分数平均提升2.6%，在领域外数据集上提升4%。

Conclusion: 深度集成LLMs能有效推进实体链接技术发展，自验证机制通过利用全局上下文显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

TL;DR: 提出了ArbESC+系统，这是首个阿拉伯语多系统语法纠错方法，通过结合多个模型和分类器来提升纠错效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语具有复杂的形态和句法结构，现有方法多使用单一模型，没有充分利用多系统组合的潜力。

Method: 使用AraT5、ByT5、mT5、AraBART等多个模型收集纠错建议，将建议表示为数值特征，通过分类器确定并实施适当修正，并使用支持技术过滤重叠修正和评估决策可靠性。

Result: 在QALB-14测试数据上F0.5达到82.63%，在QALB-15 L1数据上达到84.64%，在QALB-15 L2数据上达到65.55%，优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个整合语言错误修正的阿拉伯语尝试，为开发先进的阿拉伯文本处理工具提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

Conclusion: 该工作通过正确的语料库和训练目标，为音乐领域LLM的构建提供了可扩展的数据训练框架和评估工具，推动了领域专用语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

TL;DR: 提出Authentic-Dubber模型，通过检索增强的导演-演员交互学习方案，模拟真实电影配音工作流程，显著提升情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电影配音方法模拟简化的工作流程，演员直接配音而缺乏准备，忽略了导演与演员之间的关键互动。真实工作流程中导演会指导演员内化情感背景线索。

Method: 构建多模态参考片段库；提出基于情感相似性的检索增强策略；开发渐进式图基语音生成方法，逐步整合检索到的多模态情感知识。

Result: 在V2C Animation基准数据集上的主客观评估验证了有效性，实现了情感表达能力的全面提升。

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber能够忠实复制真实的配音工作流程，在情感表达方面取得显著改进。

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench是首个针对非洲英语口音的领域特定评估套件，涵盖100多种口音、10多个国家和7个应用领域，评估了多种语音识别系统在非洲语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI技术快速发展，但缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的公开应用特定模型评估，需要为非洲使用场景开发包容性语音应用。

Method: 使用来自各种开放非洲英语口音语音数据集的自然和非自然语音对话，对开源和专有ASR模型、多模态LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自然语音中表现良好但在嘈杂非母语对话中退化；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但处理领域特定命名实体困难；专有模型在清晰语音中准确率高但不同国家和领域差异显著。

Conclusion: 非洲英语微调的模型在延迟较低的情况下达到竞争性准确率，但幻觉问题仍是大多数SOTA模型的主要挑战，该基准有助于为非洲社区选择合适语音技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种熵引导的训练框架来解决推理模型中的熵冲突问题，将推理长度压缩到原始的20%同时保持或提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但其思维链输出过长导致计算成本高和部署困难。现有压缩方法忽略了训练过程中的熵冲突现象，即压缩目标减少熵导致推理变短但探索受限，而性能目标增加熵导致推理链变长，使模型陷入局部困境

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架：当熵下降时引导模型进行简洁推理；当熵上升时在紧凑推理模式下增强探索以提高鲁棒性

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上的实验表明，该方法将推理长度压缩到原始的20%，同时保持甚至超过了基线准确率

Conclusion: 提出的熵引导训练框架有效解决了推理模型压缩中的熵冲突问题，实现了推理长度的大幅压缩而不损失性能

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过预测概率分布来增强LLM置信度估计的深度推理，该方法在不同模型和任务中均表现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解模型响应的可靠性对应用至关重要，现有研究通过生成语言化置信度结合链式推理来提供逻辑透明的估计，但推理策略如何影响置信度估计仍需深入探索。

Method: 通过预测语言化概率分布来鼓励深度推理进行置信度估计，要求LLM考虑答案空间中的所有候选答案而非单一猜测，并仔细分配置信度分数以满足分布要求。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和各种任务中均表现出优势，无论答案空间是否已知，其优势在强化学习后仍能保持，且推理模式与人类期望一致。

Conclusion: 预测概率分布的方法能有效促进深度推理，提高置信度估计的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

Result: 评估显示当前模型在表面水平表现出色，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难，许多模型通过记忆或模式识别而非真实理解获得成功。

Conclusion: AraLingBench揭示了基于知识的基准高分与真正语言掌握之间的持续差距，为开发阿拉伯语LLM提供了诊断框架，评估代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs遵循用户指令的能力，但忽略了指令包含冲突约束的常见场景，LLMs在此类条件下的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ConInstruct基准测试，专门评估LLMs检测和解决用户指令中冲突的能力，通过该数据集分析模型的冲突检测性能和解决行为。

Result: 专有LLMs冲突检测能力强，开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现类似；DeepSeek-R1和Claude-4.5-Sonnet分别以91.5%和87.3%的F1分数排名前二；LLMs很少明确通知用户冲突或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在冲突处理方面存在关键缺陷，明确通知用户冲突是设计指令遵循LLMs时需要改进的重要方向。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

Result: 初步结果显示ATLAS能有效区分前沿模型的高级科学推理能力。

Conclusion: ATLAS将发展成长期开放的社区驱动平台，为AGI进展提供可靠评估标准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Motivation: 大语言模型在预测候选选项时存在标签偏差，现有校准方法忽视了多标记类别标签带来的偏差，特别是标签长度不一致导致的处理不一致问题。

Method: 提出标准化上下文校准(NCC)，在完整标签级别进行标准化和校准，可扩展到多项选择题等更广泛任务。

Conclusion: 缓解完整标签偏差对于提高基于LLM方法的性能和鲁棒性至关重要，特别是在类别标签自然包含多个标记的实际应用中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

*Xin Yi,Yue Li,Dongsheng Shi,Linlin Wang,Xiaoling Wang,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduHarm基准和TSSF三阶段防护框架，用于评估和增强教育场景下LLMs的安全性，同时防御越狱攻击和微调攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育应用中面临越狱和微调攻击的安全风险，现有研究缺乏针对教育场景特殊安全需求的评估和防护方案。

Method: 构建EduHarm基准包含5个教育场景的安全-不安全指令对；提出三阶段防护框架：安全感知注意力重对齐、层级安全判断、防御驱动双路由。

Result: 在8种越狱攻击策略下有效增强安全性且避免良性查询过度拒绝；在3个微调攻击数据集上实现稳健防御同时保持良性微调的效用增益。

Conclusion: TSSF框架能够同时有效防御越狱和微调攻击，为教育LLMs提供全面的安全保障。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

TL;DR: MedBench v4是一个全国性的医疗AI基准测试平台，包含70多万个专家策划的任务，涵盖24个主要专科和91个次要专科，评估了15个前沿模型。结果显示基础LLM平均得分54.1/100，多模态模型47.5/100，但基于相同骨干的智能体性能显著提升至79.8/100。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要反映真实临床工作流程和安全约束的评估框架来评估医疗大语言模型、多模态模型和智能体的性能。

Method: 构建了基于云的基准测试基础设施，包含多阶段精化和多轮临床医生评审的任务，使用LLM作为评分器校准人类评分，涵盖LLM、多模态模型和智能体三个赛道。

Result: 基础LLM平均得分54.1/100（最佳：Claude Sonnet 4.5，62.5/100），安全性和伦理得分较低（18.4/100）；多模态模型平均47.5/100（最佳：GPT-5，54.9/100）；基于相同骨干的智能体显著提升至79.8/100，Claude Sonnet 4.5智能体达到85.3/100总体得分和88.9/100安全任务得分。

Conclusion: MedBench v4揭示了基础模型在多模态推理和安全性方面存在持续差距，但治理意识的智能体编排可以显著提升临床准备度而不牺牲能力，为医院、开发者和政策制定者提供了实用的医疗AI审计参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Conclusion: Agent-R1框架为RL-based LLM智能体训练提供了实用的解决方案，有助于推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Result: 分析显示基准问题具有多样性、广泛的难度范围，能有效区分不同系统能力。

Conclusion: LiveRAG基准将有助于推进RAG研究、进行系统评估并开发更鲁棒的问答系统。

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

Motivation: 文档级声明提取在事实核查领域仍面临挑战，现有的评估方法关注有限，需要可靠的评估框架来比较模型提取和人工标注的声明集。

Method: 研究声明对齐技术，通过计算对齐得分来评估两个声明集的相似性，使用捷克和斯洛伐克新闻评论数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了当前评估方法在文档级声明提取中的局限性，特别是在处理非正式语言、强本地语境和语言细微差别时的不足。

Conclusion: 需要更先进的评估方法，能够正确捕捉语义相似性并评估声明的关键属性，如原子性、可核查性和去语境化。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

In this work, we present a novel method for collecting naturally occurring summaries via Front-Page Teasers, where editors summarize full length articles. We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.

TL;DR: 本研究使用电子健康记录数据动态追踪AKI患者的临床演变，识别了15种不同的AKI后临床状态，发现17%的AKI患者发展为CKD，并确定了不同状态下CKD风险因素的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性肾损伤（AKI）患者发展为慢性肾病（CKD）的风险很高，但识别高风险患者仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，通过纵向医疗编码和肌酐测量值聚类识别AKI后临床状态，采用多状态模型估计状态间转移概率和CKD进展概率。

Result: 在20,699名入院时患有AKI的患者中，3,491名（17%）发展为CKD。识别出15种不同的AKI后状态，每种状态具有不同的CKD发展概率。75%的患者在研究期间保持单一状态或仅进行一次状态转移。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种数据驱动的方法来识别高风险AKI患者，支持开发用于早期CKD检测和干预的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了人类标注与多种大语言模型在政治偏见检测方面的表现，发现RoBERTa与人类标注最一致，GPT在零样本设置下表现最佳，揭示了人类与LLMs在政治偏见感知上的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP技术已能自动分类政治偏见，但大语言模型与人类判断的一致性程度仍未被充分探索和理解，需要系统评估人类与LLMs在政治偏见检测方面的差异。

Method: 构建手动标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性和模型间一致性，量化人类与模型对偏见感知的差异，比较GPT、BERT、RoBERTa和FLAN等模型。

Result: 传统基于Transformer的模型中，RoBERTa与人类标签对齐度最高；生成模型如GPT在零样本设置下与人类标注总体一致性最强；微调后的RoBERTa模型在所有基线中获得了最高准确率和最强的人类标签对齐度。

Conclusion: 人类与LLMs在政治倾向感知上存在系统性差异，需要在自动化媒体偏见检测中结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Method: 使用视觉语言模型作为评判者，根据动态生成的领域特定标准评估图表，使智能体能够实时纠正错误并指导探索性数据分析。

Result: 在10个数据驱动发现任务基准测试中，VLM增强系统达到0.7-0.8的pass@1分数，优于仅代码（0.2-0.3）和代码加文本（0.4-0.5）的基线方法。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型增强的多智能体系统显著提高了自主科学发现的性能，同时提供可审计的推理轨迹，增强了可解释性。

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较性幻觉是一种语言处理中的系统性错觉现象，先前研究认为这可以用贝叶斯推理和噪声通道理论解释，但需要更精确的定量模型验证。

Method: 通过将统计语言模型与人类行为数据相结合，构建了一个计算后验概率的定量模型，直接预测幻觉强度。

Result: 模型不仅解释了比较性幻觉效应的细微差异，还解释了代词与完整名词短语在than从句中引起的先前未解释的效应。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持噪声通道理论作为语言处理现象的统计算法级理论，能够解释包括幻觉和非幻觉情境在内的多种语言处理现象。

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在缺乏直接证据时容易产生幻觉，这种效应在交互的LLM网络中会扩散传播，导致原本准确的LLM也开始产生幻觉，需要系统性地建模和分析这种现象。

Method: 结合网络科学的平均场动力学和经济学中的随机效用模型，构建了包含潜在状态（真实/幻觉）的生成模型，分析有向网络中信息扩散的动态过程。

Result: 为具有两种潜在状态的LLM网络建立了固定点存在性和唯一性的充分条件，分析了激励因素对固定点行为的影响，并在100个开源LLM网络上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: LLM网络中的幻觉传播可以通过平均场动力学和随机效用模型有效建模，网络结构、数据异质性和节点能力等因素显著影响集体幻觉的形成和传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

TL;DR: 提出了KANGURA框架，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行3D几何建模，在MFC阳极结构优化中表现出色，在ModelNet40数据集上达到92.7%准确率，在真实MFC问题上达到97%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测模型难以捕捉微生物燃料电池阳极结构的复杂几何依赖性，限制了性能优化。

Method: KANGURA将预测建模为函数分解问题，使用KAN网络重构几何关系，通过几何解耦表示学习和统一注意力机制增强空间理解。

Result: 在ModelNet40基准数据集上超越15个SOTA模型，达到92.7%准确率；在真实MFC阳极结构问题上达到97%准确率。

Conclusion: KANGURA为3D几何建模提供了稳健框架，为先进制造和质量驱动工程应用中的复杂结构优化开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

TL;DR: 评估KOSMOS AI科学家在辐射生物学中的三个假设，发现一个明确发现、一个不确定结果和一个错误假设，表明AI科学家能产生有用想法但需要严格验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自主AI科学家KOSMOS在辐射生物学问题上的表现，测试其生成假设和发现的能力

Method: 使用简单随机基因零基准测试KOSMOS在三个辐射生物学问题上的表现：1）DNA损伤反应能力预测p53转录反应；2）OGT和CDO1基线表达预测辐射反应模块；3）12基因表达特征预测前列腺癌放疗后生存

Result: 假设1不支持（DDR评分与p53反应弱负相关）；假设2中OGT弱相关，CDO1为明确异常值；假设3的12基因特征达到一致性指数0.61但效应大小不唯一

Conclusion: AI科学家能生成有用想法但需要针对适当零模型进行严格审计，KOSMOS产生了一个明确发现、一个不确定结果和一个错误假设

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

Motivation: Bjøru等人的方法仅适用于马尔可夫模型，而半马尔可夫模型能够表示更复杂的混杂关系，因此需要扩展该方法以适应更一般的因果模型。

Result: 开发了适用于半马尔可夫结构因果模型的反事实概率边界计算方法。

Conclusion: 成功将分治算法扩展到半马尔可夫模型，为处理更复杂的因果推断问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Method: 构建交通相关有害查询数据集；提出基于图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击；开发多层响应过滤防御技术；使用GPT-4判断和人工验证评估攻击与防御效果。

Result: 实验表明所提出的越狱攻击方法对开源和闭源LVLMs都有效，揭示了图像排版操纵和多轮提示在ITS集成LVLMs中带来的严重安全风险。

Conclusion: LVLMs在智能交通系统中存在严重安全漏洞，需要有效的防御机制来防止越狱攻击，确保系统的安全可靠运行。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [170] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CORGI的新匹配算法，用于解决规则系统中指数级时间和空间复杂度的匹配问题，特别针对具有多个未约束变量的规则和组合中间部分匹配的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时AI系统和关系数据库查询需要在严格时间约束下解决复杂匹配问题。当AI系统自动生成规则时，容易产生最坏情况匹配模式，导致程序执行缓慢或内存溢出。

Method: CORGI采用两步方法：在正向传递中构建/维护接地关系图，然后通过迭代器按需反向遍历图生成匹配。与传统RETE不同，CORGI没有传统的β内存来收集部分匹配。

Result: 在性能评估中，CORGI在简单组合匹配任务上显著优于SOAR和OPS5的RETE实现。CORGI提供了二次时间和空间保证来找到单个满意匹配，并能迭代流式传输后续匹配。

Conclusion: CORGI算法消除了填充完整冲突集导致的高延迟延迟和内存溢出问题，使系统在实际应用中更加可靠，无需手工工程约束或面临不可预测的故障模式。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Result: 提出的VQA图评分在四个最先进的生成模型中，基于熵验证优于CLIP和BLIP指标，证实其具有更高的判别敏感性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成逼真的工作场所危险场景图像，为训练视觉模型检测工作场所危险提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案准确性和推理路径可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效和准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中分类决策至关重要，但真实数据难以收集，需要高质量的基准数据集来开发AI分类系统。

Method: 使用LLM生成分类案例的Syn-STARTS框架，并与手动整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行定性比较。

Result: Syn-STARTS生成的分类案例在质量上与手动整理的数据集无法区分，且在标准START分类法的四类案例评估中表现高度稳定。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发高性能AI模型用于严重和关键医疗情况方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，实现了高效的自动化页面设计。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLEAR框架解决了现有AI代理基准测试忽视企业关键需求的问题，通过成本、延迟、效能、保证和可靠性五个维度进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理基准测试主要关注任务完成准确率，而忽略了企业部署所需的关键要素如成本效率、可靠性和运营稳定性。

Method: 提出CLEAR评估框架，包含成本、延迟、效能、保证和可靠性五个维度，对6个领先代理在300个企业任务上进行评估。

Result: 仅优化准确率的代理比成本感知替代方案贵4.4-10.8倍；专家评估显示CLEAR能更好预测生产成功（ρ=0.83 vs 准确率评估的ρ=0.41）。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架为AI代理的企业部署提供了更全面的评估标准，显著优于仅关注准确率的传统评估方法。

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Motivation: 5G和物联网驱动的现代通信网络中，传统集中式机器学习难以处理分布式数据和隐私问题，现有联邦学习方法存在成本高、泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出HFL-FlowLLM框架，将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习环境下的网络流量流分类。

Result: 相比最先进的异构联邦学习方法，平均F1分数提升约13%；相比现有大语言模型联邦学习框架，在参与客户端增加时平均F1分数提升达5%，同时训练成本降低约87%。

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM在现代通信网络安全中具有巨大潜力和实用价值。

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在金融应用中存在前瞻性偏差问题，研究发现它们理解时间顺序的能力有限。随着任务复杂度增加，准确率显著下降，但明确分配推理预算能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs是否真正理解时间顺序，这对金融和经济学应用至关重要，因为防止前瞻性偏差需要模型准确理解时间关系。

Method: 设计三种时间顺序任务：时间排序、条件排序（先过滤后排序）和时代错误检测，评估GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet和GPT-5在不同推理努力设置下的表现。

Result: 随着序列长度增加，精确匹配率急剧下降；条件排序中失败主要来自过滤步骤；时代错误检测是最简单的任务。GPT-5在中等/高推理努力下能实现完美排序。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在时间顺序任务上存在局限性，明确分配推理预算能显著提升性能，这对金融实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段架构来减少Whisper模型的幻觉错误：第一阶段通过自适应层注意力增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段使用多目标知识蒸馏抑制幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而现有方法主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，对模型本身的修改探索不足

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力(ALA)：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组，使用可学习多头注意力融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏(KD)：在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了在干净语音上的性能

Conclusion: ALA和KD提供了一种原则性策略来提高Whisper在真实世界噪声条件下的可靠性

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM知识图谱推理方法的两个关键局限：1) 不加区分地提取推理路径可能引入无关噪声误导LLM；2) 动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: 采用"检索-优先化-推理"三阶段：1) 从KG中检索查询子图；2) 引入路径优先化机制，使用语义感知路径优先级函数同时考虑累积成本和预估未来成本；3) 通过双阶段训练策略生成准确响应。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性路径引导有效提升了知识图谱推理的忠实性和可解释性，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在自动生成优化问题模型时表现出的成功可能源于训练数据污染而非真正推理能力，当对经典CSPLib问题进行改写和扰动后，模型性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs自动生成优化模型的能力是否真正基于推理，还是仅仅因为训练数据中包含了标准问题而表现良好。

Method: 系统性地改写和扰动一组知名CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但修改上下文并引入误导元素，然后比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下的模型生成表现。

Result: LLMs能够生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动建模方面的能力有限，主要依赖于训练数据中的模式匹配，而非真正的推理理解。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Conclusion: 这是回答关键问题的初步步骤：对齐应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动的信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

Result: 在多样化代理任务上的实验表明，AutoTool将推理成本降低了高达30%，同时保持了竞争力的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将统计结构集成到LLM代理设计中的潜力，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更高的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: 采用参考广播基础设施同步协议，利用无线通信的广播特性，在ESP32模块和商用Wi-Fi接入点上实现

Result: 使用节能且经济实惠的硬件实现了±30微秒的同步精度

Conclusion: 该方法适用于广泛的应用场景，并将实现作为开源软件发布

Abstract: Wireless time synchronization of mobile devices is a key enabler for numerous Industry 4.0 applications, such as coordinated and synchronized tasks or the generation of high-precision timestamps for machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms. Traditional wireline clock synchronization protocols, however, cannot achieve the performance in wireless environments without significant modifications. To address this challenge, we make use of the Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization protocol, which leverages the broadcast nature of wireless communications and remains both non-invasive and standard-compliant. We implement and validate this protocol on a low-cost testbed using ESP32 modules and a commercial Wi-Fi access point. To support further research and development, we release our implementation as open-source software under the GNU General Public License Version 3 license via the OpenWifiSync project on GitHub.
  Our results demonstrate that synchronization accuracies within +/-30 microseconds are achievable using energy-efficient and affordable hardware, making this approach suitable for a wide range of use cases.

*Michael Gundall,Hans D. Schotten*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用现有基础设施实现用户设备(UE)时间同步的方案，其中一个UE作为主时钟，可为工厂网络提供边界时钟功能，在实验室环境中实现了±50纳秒的同步精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)市场规模较小，相关增强功能尚未在芯片中实现，需要探索替代方案来实现无线系统的精确时间同步，以满足工业应用和5G对亚微秒级精度的要求。

Method: 使用能够利用现有基础设施的协议来同步用户设备，其中一个UE作为主时钟；如果该主UE通过有线链路连接到工厂网络，还可以作为工厂网络的边界时钟；采用OpenAirInterface和软件定义无线电在硬件测试平台上实现方案，并使用不同窗口大小的移动平均滤波器分析时间偏移和时钟偏差。

Result: 在受控实验室环境中，该方法能够持续实现±50纳秒的同步精度，窗口大小为1024的滤波器在UE间偏移预测方面提供最佳精度，为实际部署中的同步误差留出了足够余量，同时仍保持亚微秒级精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的协议对于严格的工业用例具有可行性和高性能，能够满足工业应用对精确时间同步的要求。

Abstract: Achieving precise time synchronization in wireless systems is essential for both industrial applications and 5G, where sub-microsecond accuracy is required. However, since the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is negligible compared to the consumer electronics market, the so-called IIoT enhancements have not yet been implemented in silicon. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this situation will change soon. Thus, alternative solutions must be explored. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scheme that uses a protocol capable of leveraging existing infrastructure to synchronize User Equipments (UEs), with one of the UEs serving as the master. If this master is connected via a wired link to the factory network, it can also function as a boundary clock for the factory network, including any Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network. Furthermore, the 5G Core Network (5GC) and 5G Base Station (gNB) can also be synchronized if they are connected either to the factory network or to the master UE. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on a hardware testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Time offset and clock skew are analyzed using a moving average filter with various window sizes. Results show that a filter size of 1024 provides the best accuracy for offset prediction between UEs. In a controlled lab environment, the approach consistently achieves synchronization within +/-50 ns, leaving sufficient margin for synchronization errors in real deployments while still maintaining sub-microsecond accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the proposed protocol for stringent industrial use cases.

*Heng Zhao,Ruoyu Wang,Tianhang Zheng,Qi Li,Bo Lv,Yuyi Wang,Wenliang Du*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BGPShield是一个基于LLM嵌入的BGP异常检测框架，通过捕捉AS的行为画像和路由策略原理来检测前缀劫持和错误配置，在16个真实数据集上实现100%的异常检测率和低于5%的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BGP异常检测方法依赖人工检查，扩展性有限；现有的机器学习方法虽然自动化但精度不足、泛化性差且重训练成本高，主要原因是它们只关注拓扑结构而忽略了AS的语义特征。

Method: 提出BGPShield框架：1）使用段式聚合方案将AS描述转换为LLM表示；2）轻量级对比压缩网络将表示压缩为语义一致版本；3）AR-DTW算法对齐和累积语义距离来检测行为不一致性。

Result: 在16个真实数据集上评估，BGPShield检测到100%的已验证异常，误报率低于5%。能够为未见过的AS在1秒内构建表示，显著优于需要65小时重训练的BEAM方法。

Conclusion: BGPShield通过捕捉AS的语义特征而非仅拓扑结构，实现了高精度、强泛化性和低成本的BGP异常检测，验证了LLM在网络安全领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The trust-based nature of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) makes it vulnerable to disruptions like prefix hijacking and misconfigurations, threatening routing stability. Traditional detection relies on manual inspection with limited scalability. Machine/Deep Learning (M/DL) approaches automate detection but suffer from suboptimal precision, limited generalizability, and high retraining costs. This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes.
  To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role. We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version. Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies. Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%. Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability. Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours).

TL;DR: 本文分析了多路径TCP(MPTCP)协议，研究了不同路径异构条件下各种分组调度和拥塞控制算法组合对MPTCP性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动和固定设备配备多个网络接口，MPTCP协议被开发来同时使用多个网络路径。然而，当路径间异构性增加时，MPTCP性能面临挑战。

Method: 对MPTCP协议操作进行概述，分析文献中最先进的分组调度和拥塞控制算法，并在不同路径异构条件下进行广泛的实验评估。

Result: 通过实验评估分析了各种算法组合对MPTCP性能的影响，特别是在路径异构性增加的情况下的表现。

Conclusion: MPTCP在相似网络特性的链路组合中具有优势，但随着路径间异构性的增加，其性能会受到挑战，需要合适的算法组合来优化性能。

Abstract: Modern mobile and stationary devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces aiming to provide wireless and wireline connectivity either in a local LAN or the Internet. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol has been developed on top of legacy TCP to allow the simultaneous use of multiple network paths in the communication route between two end-systems. Although the combination of multiple paths is beneficial in case of links with similar network characteristics, MPTCP performance is challenged as heterogeneity among the used paths increases. This work provides an overview of the MPTCP protocol operation, analyzes the state-of-art packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms available in literature, and examines the impact of the various algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance, by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation under diverse path-heterogeneity conditions.

### [197] [Show and Tell: Prompt Strategies for Style Control in Multi-Turn LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13972)
*Jeremiah Bohr*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究表明，指令提示、示例提示和组合提示在代码生成中产生不同的初始风格控制效果和扩展纪律性，组合提示在双轮工作流程中提供最稳定的风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成代码时过度冗长、文档繁琐和防御性模式的问题，探索不同提示机制在保持功能准确性的同时控制代码风格的效果。

Method: 采用四组系统提示条件（指令、示例、组合、无提示），在双轮协议中让模型先生成Python任务解决方案，然后在一般改进指令下修订代码，共收集160对程序。

Result: 组合提示产生最强的初始压缩效果和最大的扩展纪律性；指令提示有大的初始效果和中等扩展纪律性；示例提示只有适度初始效果且无扩展纪律性。

Conclusion: 初始提示效果和扩展纪律性是提示设计的两个独立方面，组合方法在双轮工作流程中提供最稳定的风格控制。

Abstract: Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过定性访谈探讨计算机科学学生如何在软件开发项目中策略性和伦理性地使用ChatGPT，发现学生采用新的学习模式，将ChatGPT贡献限制在约30%，但只有少数人会深入分析AI生成代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ChatGPT在计算机科学教育中的应用日益增多，但现有研究主要依赖调查问卷，缺乏对学生使用策略和伦理意识的深入分析。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈的定性研究方法，对英国一所院校的计算机科学学生进行调查，探讨他们在软件开发项目中如何使用ChatGPT。

Result: 学生从传统的"独立思考-手动编码-迭代调试"转向"AI辅助构思-交互式编程-协作优化"的学习模式。多数学生将ChatGPT用于加深理解，但保留创意和高级决策任务给自己，并评估其输出以减少过度依赖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学习者与AI动态关系的变化，强调需要明确的指导方针来支持负责任和教学上合理的使用ChatGPT等工具。

Abstract: ChatGPT has been increasingly used in computer science, offering efficient support across software development tasks. While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional "independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging" to "AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization." Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.

TL;DR: LoCoBench-Agent是一个专门评估LLM智能体在真实长上下文软件工程工作流中能力的框架，扩展了LoCoBench的8000个场景为交互式环境，评估多轮对话、工具使用、错误恢复和架构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准如LoCoBench主要评估单轮代码理解，无法捕捉真实编码智能体所需的多轮交互、工具使用模式和自适应推理能力。

Method: 将LoCoBench的8000个场景扩展到交互式智能体环境，提供8个专业工具（文件操作、搜索、代码分析），在10K到1M token的上下文长度范围内评估，使用9个理解度和效率维度的指标。

Result: 评估发现：(1)智能体表现出显著的长上下文鲁棒性；(2)理解度与效率存在负相关的权衡关系；(3)对话效率在不同模型间差异显著，策略性工具使用模式区分高性能智能体。

Conclusion: 作为首个软件工程领域的长上下文LLM智能体基准，LoCoBench-Agent为衡量智能体能力、识别性能差距和推进大规模自主软件开发建立了严谨基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into sophisticated autonomous agents capable of complex software development tasks, evaluating their real-world capabilities becomes critical. While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlakyGuard 是一种修复不稳定测试的新方法，通过将代码视为图结构并使用选择性图探索来找到最相关的上下文，解决了现有方法在工业环境中因上下文问题而失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不稳定的测试会浪费开发人员时间并减慢发布周期。现有方法如 FlakyDoctor 在工业环境中因上下文问题（提供太少或太多上下文）而失败。

Method: 将代码视为图结构，使用选择性图探索来找到最相关的上下文，避免提供过多或过少的信息。

Result: 在真实工业仓库的不稳定测试中，FlakyGuard 修复了 47.6% 的可重现不稳定测试，其中 51.8% 的修复被开发者接受，比现有最佳方法至少高出 22% 的修复成功率。

Conclusion: FlakyGuard 通过选择性图探索有效解决了不稳定测试修复中的上下文问题，在工业环境中表现出色，开发者调查显示其根因解释被认为很有用。

Abstract: Flaky tests that non-deterministically pass or fail waste developer time and slow release cycles. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.

TL;DR: 研究如何在代码库持续演进的情况下保持代码搜索模型的新鲜度，比较了三种更新策略：完全刷新、上下文学习和增量微调，发现增量微调在平衡新旧代码性能方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码库持续演进，导致训练好的代码搜索模型会快速退化，需要研究如何在不放弃对旧代码记忆的情况下保持模型新鲜度。

Method: 将代码新鲜度视为领域漂移问题，比较三种更新策略：(A)完全刷新重训练；(B)上下文学习注入最近变更；(C)增量微调结合新旧数据混合训练。

Result: 在Flask、SQLAlchemy、Pandas和Poetry等项目中，增量微调在混合数据集上表现最佳，上下文学习在无法训练时提升新代码性能最快，完全刷新在新代码准确性上仍是上限。

Conclusion: 增量微调是保持代码搜索模型新鲜度的最佳平衡策略，而不同更新方法在不同类型的代码变更场景中各有优势。

Abstract: Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.

TL;DR: LogPurge是一个成本感知、规则增强的日志净化框架，能够自动从受污染的日志序列中选择足够的正常子集来训练异常检测模型，解决了获取干净日志数据的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代日志异常检测方法需要基于干净的、无异常的日志序列训练深度学习模型，但获取这样的干净日志数据需要昂贵且繁琐的人工标注，现有的自动清洗方法未能充分整合日志的特定特征和实际语义。

Method: 采用两阶段过滤算法：第一阶段使用大语言模型(LLM)去除聚类异常模式并增强系统规则以改进LLM对系统日志的理解；第二阶段使用分治策略将剩余污染区域分解为更小的子问题，每个子问题通过第一阶段程序有效净化。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个工业数据集上的实验表明，该方法平均移除了98.74%的异常，同时保留了82.39%的正常样本。与最新的无监督日志样本选择算法相比，在公共数据集上F-1分数分别提高了35.7%和84.11%，在私有数据集上F-1分数提高了149.72%。

Conclusion: LogPurge方法在日志异常检测领域表现出显著的有效性，能够高效地从受污染的日志数据中提取干净样本用于模型训练。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空航天系统日益复杂，需要在敏捷性和严格的安全认证要求之间取得平衡，开发既能保持敏捷性又能满足DO-178C认证要求的软件开发流程。

Method: 定制化Scrum框架，包括多学科产品所有权模型、双重验收标准、独立测试和文档团队、认证联络员等关键增强功能，并通过两个可比航空航天项目进行实证评估。

Result: 相比传统瀑布模型，总需求工作量减少76%，缺陷检测速度提升75%，缺陷解决速度提升78%，缺陷密度降低50%以上，同时保持完全符合DO-178C设计保证等级A。

Conclusion: 敏捷实践与监管合规可以共存，但需要纪律性的定制和与认证机构的主动合作，未来可通过自动化、CI/CD实践等进一步优化，该框架也适用于其他安全关键行业。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of aerospace systems requires development processes that balance agility with stringent safety and certification demands. This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements.

Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动化单元测试生成方法在真实项目中往往难以生成既正确又可维护的测试用例，需要更有效的知识集成策略来提升测试质量。

Method: 通过静态分析提取项目结构和使用知识，采用测试领域知识指导的测试用例设计与测试方法生成分离，结合多视角提示策略引导LLM考虑多样化测试启发式，生成结构化模板测试。

Result: 在多个开源项目上的评估显示，KTester在六项关键指标上显著优于现有方法，执行通过率提升5.69%，行覆盖率提升8.83%，同时需要更少时间和生成更少测试用例。人工评估也确认了KTester在正确性、可读性和可维护性方面的优势。

Conclusion: KTester通过集成项目特定知识和测试领域知识，有效提升了LLM测试生成的质量，证明了知识驱动框架在实际应用中的优势。

Abstract: Automated unit test generation using large language models (LLMs) holds great promise but often struggles with generating tests that are both correct and maintainable in real-world projects. This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨认知能力和人格特质如何共同影响软件问题解决，发现认知能力（语法推理准确性）与问题解决表现正相关，尽责性和开放性人格特质对软件问题解决有积极影响，而神经质则有轻微负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程是深度认知活动，受个体差异影响。研究旨在了解认知能力和人格特质如何共同影响软件问题解决表现，为教育和行业实践提供指导。

Method: 对80名参与者（40名软件从业者，40名软件工程学生）进行研究，使用Baddeley三分钟语法推理测试测量认知能力，IPIP NEO 50测试评估人格特质，并完成9个面试式问题解决任务（6个编码相关，3个逻辑推理）。

Result: 从业者在语法推理准确性和整体任务表现上略优于学生。语法推理准确性与问题解决表现正相关。尽责性特质与问题解决和推理准确性相关性最强，开放性与两者正相关，神经质与准确性和表现呈轻微负相关。

Conclusion: 尽责性和开放性特质与推理准确性共同支持软件问题解决，而负面情绪可能在时间压力下阻碍精确性。研究对教育（整合结构化推理任务）和行业（招聘和角色分配中考虑人格认知）具有实践意义。

Abstract: Software engineering is a deeply cognitive activity shaped by individual differences that extend beyond technical skill. This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation. We highlight directions for future research such as longitudinal and task diverse replications with larger samples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主系统在涉及学习组件和开放环境时难以确保安全性和可信性。形式化方法需要完整模型和静态假设，而LLMs虽然擅长模式识别但缺乏形式化保证且容易出错。

Method: 提出RV与LLMs的共生集成框架：RV作为LLM驱动自主系统的防护栏，LLMs辅助RV进行规范捕获、支持预期推理和处理不确定性。

Result: 该集成框架不同于现有的调查和路线图，通过相互强化实现更可靠的自主性。

Conclusion: 这种共生集成能够应对自主系统安全保证的挑战，为构建可信赖的自主系统指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在软件工程质性研究中集成大语言模型进行主题分析的方法论影响，发现LLM可以提高效率和扩展性，但存在偏见、上下文丢失等风险，需要人类持续监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于辅助软件工程质性研究，这种使用方法的方法论影响仍未得到充分探索。LLM融入解释性过程（如主题分析）引发了关于严谨性、透明度和研究人员能动性的基本问题。

Method: 与25名ISERN研究人员进行反思性研讨会，通过结构化讨论LLM辅助的开放式编码、主题生成和主题审查，使用彩色编码画布记录感知到的机会、局限性和建议。

Result: 参与者认识到潜在的效率和可扩展性收益，但强调了与偏见、上下文丢失、可重复性以及LLM快速演变相关的风险。他们还强调了提示素养和持续人类监督的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM可以作为支持但不能替代解释性分析的工具。该研究有助于社区持续反思如何负责任地使用LLM增强软件工程中的质性研究。

Abstract: [Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assist qualitative research in Software Engineering (SE), yet the methodological implications of this usage remain underexplored. Their integration into interpretive processes such as thematic analysis raises fundamental questions about rigor, transparency, and researcher agency. [Objective] This study investigates how experienced SE researchers conceptualize the opportunities, risks, and methodological implications of integrating LLMs into thematic analysis. [Method] A reflective workshop with 25 ISERN researchers guided participants through structured discussions of LLM-assisted open coding, theme generation, and theme reviewing, using color-coded canvases to document perceived opportunities, limitations, and recommendations. [Results] Participants recognized potential efficiency and scalability gains, but highlighted risks related to bias, contextual loss, reproducibility, and the rapid evolution of LLMs. They also emphasized the need for prompting literacy and continuous human oversight. [Conclusion] Findings portray LLMs as tools that can support, but not substitute, interpretive analysis. The study contributes to ongoing community reflections on how LLMs can responsibly enhance qualitative research in SE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决openEHR和HL7 FHIR之间由于数据建模方法根本差异和缺乏标准化转换机制而导致的医疗互操作性挑战。

Method: 开发FHIRconnect DSL和开源转换引擎(openFHIR)，采用三层架构，利用国际原型基础支持本地定制化，实现标准化双向数据交换。

Result: 成功映射24个国际原型到15个FHIR配置文件，覆盖7个临床领域，建立社区驱动的映射标准化技术基础。

Conclusion: FHIRconnect减少了自定义ETL解决方案的依赖，推进了基于开放标准的医疗IT系统的语法和语义互操作性。

Abstract: Healthcare interoperability between openEHR and HL7 FHIR remains challenging due to fundamental differences in their data modeling approaches and the absence of standardized transformation mechanisms. This paper presents FHIRconnect, a novel domain-specific language and open-source transformation engine that enables standardized, bidirectional data exchange between openEHR and FHIR. Our approach addresses critical interoperability gaps through a triple-layered architecture that achieves 65% mapping reuse across projects by leveraging international archetype-based foundations while supporting local customizations. Using this framework, FHIRconnect successfully mapped 24 international archetypes to 15 FHIR profiles across seven clinical domains. Key contributions include the first comprehensive DSL for openEHR-FHIR transformation with a formal specification, an open-source execution engine (openFHIR), and an accessible mapping library covering high-impact clinical archetypes. Together, these components establish the technical basis for community-driven mapping standardization, reducing reliance on custom ETL solutions and advancing syntactic and semantic interoperability in healthcare IT systems built on open standards.

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.
