Motivation: 现有方法在长视觉文档理解中存在证据定位的根本挑战，难以检索相关页面并忽略视觉元素中的细粒度细节，导致性能有限和模型幻觉。

Method: 提出DocLens框架，首先从完整文档导航到相关页面上的特定视觉元素，然后采用采样裁决机制生成单一可靠答案。

Result: 与Gemini-2.5-Pro配对，DocLens在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上实现最先进性能，甚至超越人类专家，在视觉中心和不可回答查询上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: DocLens通过增强的定位能力展示了其优势，特别是在处理视觉中心和不可回答查询时，证明了其改进的证据定位能力的有效性。

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法需要密集多视角输入和昂贵的逐实例优化，限制了可扩展性。feedforward方法虽然更快但几何粗糙、缺乏纹理重建且依赖复杂多阶段流程。

Method: 将LVSM扩展到关节设置，使用基于transformer的架构联合推理相机位姿和关节变化，生成深度图和部件掩码以辅助3D网格提取和关节估计。

Result: 在多种物体类别上实现高保真重建，在新视角合成、状态合成和3D关节物体重建方面优于现有方法，生成与输入图像紧密贴合的高质量网格。

Conclusion: LARM无需密集监督，支持跨类别的高质量3D关节物体重建，为相关应用提供了可扩展且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/
