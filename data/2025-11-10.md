TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是首个以印度次大陆为中心的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三个任务，共约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型在文化多样性环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数视觉语言模型评估基准都是西方中心的，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含英语和10种印度语言的大规模基准测试，涵盖OCR、多模态机器翻译和视觉问答三个多模态任务，涉及13个文化相关主题。

Result: 实验显示当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著性能差距，暴露了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench为更包容的多模态研究建立了可复现的评估框架，强调了文化多样性和多语言性的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于检测合成医学图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，通过两阶段框架（特征提取器和隔离森林检测器）在乳腺X光合成数据集上实现了高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽然能解决训练数据稀缺问题，但未经质量评估可能引入伪影和失真特征，影响模型性能和临床实用性，因此需要检测网络诱导的形状伪影。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）新颖的特征提取器，通过分析解剖边界角度梯度的每图像分布构建专门特征空间；2）基于隔离森林的异常检测器。

Result: 在两个合成乳腺X光数据集上，方法成功将伪影集中在最异常分区（1%分位数），AUC值分别为0.97和0.91，与人类读者的一致性达到66%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了合成数据的负责任使用，使开发者能够根据已知解剖约束评估合成图像，定位并解决特定问题以提高合成数据集质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)方法，通过在控制条件而非生成图像上进行偏好学习，解决了传统DPO方法中难以分离可控性和图像质量的问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet++虽然通过优化低噪声时间步来提升像素级循环一致性，但忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入了近似误差。DPO方法虽然能优化所有时间步，但由于生成模型的不确定性，难以确保胜败图像对仅在可控性上有差异而保持其他因素不变。

Method: 提出条件偏好优化(CPO)，在控制信号而非生成图像上构建胜败对(c^w和c^l)，训练模型偏好c^w。这种方法消除了混杂因素，提供了低方差的训练目标。

Result: CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于最先进的ControlNet++：分割任务错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态任务降低70-80%，边缘和深度图任务一致降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO通过直接在控制条件上进行偏好学习，有效提升了文本到图像生成的可控性，同时降低了训练目标的方差和数据集构建的计算存储成本。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN是一种动态自适应正则化网络，通过任务复杂度预测器、自适应dropout调制和动态容量门控来解决卫星图像异质性挑战，在完整微调和高效适应两种范式下都取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定正则化策略的解码器，无法处理卫星图像的显著异质性，限制了基础模型在地理空间分析中的适应效果。

Method: DARN包含三个关键创新：轻量级任务复杂度预测器、基于预测复杂度动态调整dropout率(0.1-0.5)的自适应dropout调制，以及调制通道激活的动态容量门控。

Result: 在完整微调中，DARN在GeoBench基准上达到86.66% mIoU的新SOTA；在高效适应中，在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，并在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用中利用基础模型提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的3D云图重建方法，首次实现全球瞬时3D云图生成，能准确重建强风暴的3D结构，填补卫星观测空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋(TC)预报面临挑战，因为卫星观测有限且难以解析TC增强相关的云属性。现有机器学习方法局限于TC罕见区域且对强风暴验证不足。

Method: 采用预训练-微调流程，从全球覆盖的多卫星数据学习，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制TC数据集上评估性能。

Result: 首次创建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强风暴的3D结构，不仅能扩展可用卫星观测，还能在观测完全缺失时提供估计。

Conclusion: 该方法对推进TC增强理解和改进预报至关重要，为填补观测空白提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet是一个用于基于事件数据的眼动追踪的卷积神经网络，能够在资源受限的微控制器上运行，包括分类和回归两种架构版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪解决方案大多需要强大的GPU支持，无法在嵌入式设备上部署，需要开发能在资源受限设备上运行的高效算法。

Method: 设计了专门用于事件数据的卷积神经网络EETnet，提出训练、评估和量化方法，包含两种架构：在网格上检测瞳孔的分类模型和在像素级操作的回归模型。

Result: 开发出能够在微控制器上运行的EETnet网络，实现了基于纯事件数据的眼动追踪解决方案。

Conclusion: EETnet证明了在资源受限的嵌入式设备上实现基于事件相机的眼动追踪的可行性，为低功耗眼动追踪应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯点编码器：一种基于学习3D高斯混合的显式逐点嵌入方法，比传统PointNet更快、参数更高效，在CPU设备上也能实现高帧率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D识别任务主要使用隐式表示（如PointNet），但显式几何表示在3D重建领域已显示出优势。本文旨在将这种从隐式到显式的转变引入3D识别任务。

Method: 开发基于自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习能够重建PointNet激活的高斯基函数。扩展3D高斯泼溅的滤波技术来加速编码器。

Result: 3D高斯点编码器比同等精度的PointNet快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%。在Mamba3D中运行快1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器提供了一种高效、轻量级的显式3D表示方法，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了通用生物医学图像分割模型的数据冗余和跨域遗忘问题，提出数据集量化策略减少训练数据冗余，并通过选择性回放缓解灾难性遗忘，表明高效训练需要紧凑数据子集、保留感知学习策略和合理的域排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用生物医学图像分割模型如Cellpose被广泛应用，但训练数据冗余和跨域迁移中的模型遗忘问题尚未充分研究，需要系统分析这些挑战。

Method: 提出数据集量化(DQ)策略构建紧凑多样的训练子集；进行跨域微调实验评估灾难性遗忘；使用选择性DQ回放恢复源域性能；探索训练域排序对泛化和遗忘的影响。

Result: Cyto数据集上图像分割性能在仅10%数据时饱和，显示显著冗余；DQ选择的图像块比随机采样具有更大特征多样性；跨域微调导致源域性能显著下降；选择性回放5-10%源数据可有效恢复源性能；训练域排序改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要数据为中心的设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑数据子集，还需要保留感知学习策略和合理的域排序，以平衡模型适应性和知识保留。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合基础模型和nnU-Net的数据中心AI工作流，通过主动学习和伪标签技术，在减少人工标注需求的同时保持分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学图像分割中标注数据不足的问题。传统方法对噪声数据敏感，nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证，而大型基础模型在特定数据集上可能表现不佳。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签，用于nnU-Net的自配置；然后通过主动学习选择代表性核心集进行最小化人工标注，最后微调nnU-Net模型。

Result: 显著减少了人工标注需求，同时保持了有竞争力的分割性能。

Conclusion: 为生物医学研究人员提供了一个可访问的解决方案，能够在分割任务中应用最先进的AI技术，同时最小化人工干预。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪效果，通过标签向量集嵌入自然分割过程，结合正则化处理。

Method: 使用标签向量集作为法向量先验，基于法向量与标签向量的相似性进行分割，引入总变差正则化项，采用分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解优化问题，顶点更新基于二阶形状计算。

Result: 提出了一种新的几何去噪范式，将分割问题自然地嵌入到去噪过程中，实现了基于法向量相似性的有效分割和去噪。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将法向量先验知识与几何去噪相结合，通过分裂Bregman方法有效解决了包含分割的优化问题，为几何处理提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

<details>

Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是一个不适定问题，需要强大的几何先验。传统方法依赖外部训练数据，而本文旨在直接从输入点云本身提取形状特定先验。

Method: 联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，通过交叉注意力机制捕获形状的重复结构和长程相关性。使用自监督点云重建损失优化，然后采样生成密集点云和法向量，最后集成到稳健隐式移动最小二乘法中。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成高保真表面方面优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持能力和对数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的隐式自先验方法能够有效从点云中学习形状特定先验，结合稳健隐式移动最小二乘法，在保持输入数据精细几何细节的同时正则化稀疏区域，生成高质量表面。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

TL;DR: 提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多中心临床场景中的标准化问题，克服了传统ComBAT方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DW-MRI数据在多中心研究中存在扫描仪特异性偏差，传统ComBAT方法依赖线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量等假设，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: Clinical-ComBAT采用非线性多项式数据模型，以规范站点为参考进行站点特异性标准化，包含可适应小队列的方差先验、超参数调优和拟合优度评估指标。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，显示扩散指标的改进对齐和规范建模的增强适用性。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT为真实世界临床场景提供了灵活有效的多中心DW-MRI数据标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卫星影像的地理空间深度学习框架，用于预测致命交通事故风险，通过Beta概率分布提供不确定性感知的预测，在召回率上比基线方法提升17-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全研究孤立分析风险因素，忽略了空间复杂性；传统神经网络风险估计器缺乏不确定性量化，限制了在关键决策中的应用。

Method: 利用卫星影像作为综合空间输入，捕捉细微空间模式和嵌入式环境风险因素，通过Beta概率分布估计致命事故风险。

Result: 模型在召回率指标上比基线方法提升17-23%，并提供更好的校准性能，能够可靠地标记潜在危险。

Conclusion: 该方法仅从卫星影像就能提供可靠且可解释的风险评估，为自动驾驶安全导航和城市规划者提供了高度可扩展的工具，以公平且经济高效的方式提升道路安全。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

TL;DR: 提出IMDNet网络，通过解耦退化成分来指导路径选择，实现多退化图像恢复，同时在单退化任务上保持竞争力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像常遭受多种退化共存（如雨、噪声、雾霾），而现有方法大多只关注单一退化类型，限制了实际应用效果

Method: 设计退化成分解耦块（DIDBlock）在编码器中分离退化成分统计特征，融合块（FBlock）整合多层级退化信息，任务适应块（TABlock）在解码器中动态激活功能分支

Result: 在多退化恢复任务上表现出优越性能，同时在单退化任务上保持强大竞争力

Conclusion: IMDNet通过紧密集成的架构有效解决了多退化图像恢复问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习(MAARL)的深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以解决深度伪造检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致深度伪造日益逼真，现有被动检测器依赖特定伪造伪影而泛化能力有限，主动水印检测方法在鲁棒性和敏感性之间难以平衡。

Method: 开发可学习的水印嵌入器在潜在空间操作，利用MAARL范式让水印智能体与对抗攻击智能体交互，在良性扭曲和恶意篡改之间寻求最优平衡。

Result: 在CelebA和CelebA-HQ基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在挑战性操作场景下分别提升4.5%和5.3%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高维潜在空间表示和MAARL范式，成功实现了鲁棒且自适应的水印方案，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然渲染速度快、输出质量高，但在处理大型或复杂场景时内存需求过大，超出大多数GPU的内存容量。

Method: 利用3DGS内存访问模式的观察，采用流水线化的卸载策略，重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算，同时减少通信量。

Result: 在单个RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯的大型场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景中的内存限制问题，使其能够在消费级硬件上运行。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出PDS方法解决fMRI和dMRI模态缺失问题，通过模式感知双模态3D扩散框架和微结构细化网络，在OASIS-3、ADNI等数据集上取得最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI和dMRI在神经退行性疾病研究中至关重要，但模态缺失限制了其临床应用。现有GAN和扩散模型方法在fMRI-dMRI合成中存在BOLD信号与扩散加权信号差异大、疾病相关神经解剖模式整合不足的问题。

Method: 提出PDS方法：1）模式感知双模态3D扩散框架进行跨模态学习；2）集成高效微结构细化的组织细化网络，保持结构保真度和细节。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为29.83 dB/90.84%（比基线提升1.54 dB/4.12%），dMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为30.00 dB/77.55%（比基线提升1.02 dB/2.2%）。临床验证中合成数据在NC vs MCI vs AD分类中达到67.92%/66.02%/64.15%准确率。

Conclusion: PDS方法有效解决了fMRI-dMRI模态合成中的挑战，在定量指标和临床诊断性能上均优于现有方法，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

Motivation: 深度神经网络研究主要关注纹理特征，而对几何形状理解的研究相对不足。本文旨在探索形状作为语义载体的潜力，以及其在模型解释性和对抗攻击中的应用。

Method: 开发了一个端到端的可微分框架，包含：1）傅里叶级数参数化任意形状；2）基于绕数的映射方法将形状转换为像素网格；3）信号能量约束确保物理上合理的形状并提高优化效率。

Result: 优化的形状可以作为有效的语义载体，生成高置信度的分类结果；作为高保真度的解释工具，精确隔离模型的显著区域；并构成一种新的、可泛化的对抗范式，能够欺骗下游视觉任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为探索深度神经网络的几何世界提供了一个多功能框架，并为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Motivation: 传统拓扑数据分析方法如持久同调计算成本高昂，而神经网络估计器的发展受到缺乏专门为监督学习设计的带标签3D数据的限制。

Method: 使用排斥表面算法系统生成带标签3D数据集，可控制拓扑不变量（如孔洞数量），并采用3D卷积变换器架构训练属估计网络。

Result: 构建了具有拓扑标签的多样化几何数据集，观察到随着形变增加，估计器准确性下降，表明几何复杂性对泛化估计器训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了拓扑数据分析中训练和评估模型所需带标签3D数据的空白，为神经网络估计器的发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别主流LVLM架构中存在的语言模态偏见问题，这种偏见主要源于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法，影响了模型的视觉定位能力并导致幻觉问题。

Method: 提出一种简单而有效的方法，通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来优化文本嵌入，从而改善视觉信息在模型中的融合效果。

Result: 该方法在已建立的基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位能力，并大幅减少了幻觉现象。平均池化提供了一种直接、鲁棒且高效的视觉信息整合方式。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化方法已能有效缓解模态不平衡问题，但更复杂的融合策略可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐。本文主要关注揭示模态不平衡及其对幻觉的影响，更先进的融合策略留待未来研究。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像表示对癌症分型、识别和突变预测至关重要，但由于单个切片包含数万个图像块，受GPU限制无法在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储所有WSI的图块特征，训练时随机采样部分图块计算特征，再从内存库中选取同一切片的额外特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和内存库特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI表示和病理报告计算幻灯片级别对比损失。

Result: 在癌症分型、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法能够有效解决GPU内存限制下的全切片图像表示学习问题，在多个癌症相关任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专用设备的问题，为隐私保护、低光照和低成本场景提供解决方案。由于压力信号到全身运动的不确定性，该任务具有严重的不适定性。

Method: 提出Pressure2Motion生成模型，使用双级特征提取器准确解释压力数据，然后采用分层扩散模型识别大尺度运动轨迹和细微姿态调整，结合物理线索和语义指导。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成高保真、物理合理的运动，在该任务上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的先驱工作，建立的MPL基准是该任务的第一个基准，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了一个简化且有效的替代方案，通过统一架构和创新的训练策略实现了优异性能。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了PITTA框架，一种用于单目深度估计的测试时自适应方法，通过姿态无关的自适应范式和实例感知图像掩码，在无需相机姿态信息的情况下显著提升模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目深度估计模型在训练环境和实际部署环境条件不同时的性能下降问题，特别是在多样化和动态环境中现有测试时自适应方法效果不佳的挑战。

Method: 1) 姿态无关的测试时自适应范式，无需相机姿态信息；2) 实例感知图像掩码，使用预训练的泛在分割网络提取动态对象掩码并移除静态背景；3) 简单有效的边缘提取方法用于输入图像和深度图。

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，PITTA框架在测试时自适应过程中显著超越了现有最先进技术，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PITTA框架通过创新的姿态无关自适应和实例感知掩码策略，有效解决了单目深度估计在动态环境中的测试时自适应问题，为实际部署提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一个通过多视角角色扮演提示来增强CLIP模型训练数据语义多样性的数据合成框架，能在保持数据量不变的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和标题冗余浅显的问题，需要提升数据质量而非单纯数量。

Method: 利用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释器等）引导多模态大语言模型从不同视角生成语义多样的标题，增强图像-文本对齐的细粒度。

Result: 仅用100万对Role-SynthCLIP数据训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（500万对数据）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色提示有效提升了合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著改善了CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

TL;DR: 提出SurgiATM手术烟雾去除方法，通过统计建模将物理大气模型与深度学习结合，作为轻量级即插即用模块提升现有去烟方法的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中组织烧灼产生的烟雾会显著降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术风险，影响临床决策和计算机视觉分析，因此需要有效的手术烟雾去除方法。

Method: SurgiATM统计性地桥接基于物理的大气模型和数据驱动的深度学习模型，结合前者的泛化能力和后者的高精度，作为轻量级即插即用模块集成到各种手术去烟架构中。

Result: 在三个公共手术数据集和十种去烟方法上的实验表明，SurgiATM能普遍减少现有模型的恢复误差，相对提升其泛化能力，且不增加可训练层或权重。

Conclusion: SurgiATM具有便利性、低成本、有效性和泛化能力，是提升手术烟雾去除性能的有效解决方案。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本与干净样本的本质差异对于提升DNN鲁棒性和对抗攻击检测至关重要。

Method: 使用9种经典攻击方法生成对抗样本，引入滑动掩码置信度熵(SMCE)量化遮挡下的模型置信度波动，提出滑动窗口掩码对抗样本检测(SWM-AED)方法。

Result: 通过1800+测试图像验证，对抗样本在遮挡下表现出显著更高的置信度波动，SWM-AED在CIFAR-10上对多种分类器和攻击都表现出稳健性能，准确率大多超过62%，最高达96.5%。

Conclusion: 基于遮挡敏感性的检测方法能有效识别对抗样本，避免传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合问题。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双阶段提示驱动的隐私保护范式(DPPP)，用于生成虚拟数据训练行人重识别模型，解决了现有虚拟数据集构建复杂和领域泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私问题日益严重，研究人员开始使用虚拟数据替代敏感的真实图像训练Re-ID模型，但现有游戏引擎生成的虚拟数据集面临构建复杂和领域泛化能力差的挑战。

Method: 第一阶段：通过包含行人外观、光照、视角等多维属性的丰富提示驱动扩散模型端到端合成多样化数据，构建包含6,641个身份130,519张图像的大规模虚拟数据集GenePerson。第二阶段：提出提示驱动解耦机制(PDM)，借助对比学习使用两个文本反转网络将图像映射为代表风格和内容的伪词，构建风格解耦的内容提示来指导模型学习领域不变的内容特征。

Result: 实验表明，在GenePerson数据集上使用PDM训练的模型实现了最先进的泛化性能，超越了在流行真实和虚拟Re-ID数据集上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的DPPP范式能够有效生成高质量虚拟数据并提升行人重识别模型的领域泛化能力，为隐私保护下的模型训练提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Motivation: 恶劣天气严重影响真实世界的视觉感知，而现有基于合成数据训练的视觉模型难以泛化到复杂的退化场景。

Method: 首先构建物理驱动的高保真数据集HFLS-Weather，然后设计双层次强化学习框架：局部层次通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化改进天气特定恢复模型；全局层次使用元控制器动态编排模型选择和执行顺序。

Result: 该框架实现了对真实世界条件的持续适应，在广泛的恶劣天气场景中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架能够有效应对恶劣天气下的视觉感知挑战，通过动态适应机制实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究首次应用深度学习直接分析原始OCT B扫描图像进行阿尔茨海默病早期检测，使用预训练模型在UK Biobank队列中进行验证，ResNet-34模型在4年队列中达到0.62 AUC，为OCT-based AD预测建立了基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜层厚度变化与神经退行性疾病相关，但以往研究主要关注分层厚度测量。本研究探索直接使用OCT B扫描图像进行AD早期检测，填补了深度学习在原始OCT图像上预测AD的研究空白。

Method: 微调多个预训练模型（包括ImageNet网络和OCT专用RETFound transformer），使用UK Biobank队列中年龄、性别和成像实例匹配的数据集，应用标准及OCT特定数据增强技术，并采用年份加权损失函数优先考虑成像后4年内确诊的病例。

Result: ResNet-34模型表现最稳定，在4年队列中达到0.62 AUC。虽然低于临床应用阈值，但可解释性分析确认了AD组与对照组在中央黄斑亚区存在局部结构差异。

Conclusion: 研究为OCT-based AD预测建立了基线，强调了在AD诊断前数年检测细微视网膜生物标志物的挑战，指出需要更大数据集和多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决电影制作中由于预算限制导致的稀疏相机配置问题，现有方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时表现受限。

Method: 将规范高斯和变形场分解为前景和背景组件，使用t=0帧的稀疏掩码集进行分离，在规范预训练阶段分别用不同损失函数训练，动态训练阶段为每个变形场建模不同参数。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上实现了最先进的定性和定量结果，PSNR提升高达3分，模型大小减半，并能产生分割的动态重建包括透明和动态纹理。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下实现了高质量的动态3D重建，无需密集掩码监督，为电影制作提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在无需相机位姿的情况下有效处理动态场景渲染，在质量和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Result: 在固定分辨率下，BRIXEL显著超越DINOv3基线模型，能以更低的计算成本产生与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL是一种简单有效的知识蒸馏方法，能够在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: 提出了MUSE方法，一种专门针对病理学中细胞核检测与分类的自监督学习方法，通过多尺度密集自蒸馏机制解决现有方法对标注数据依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细胞核检测与分类方法严重依赖人工标注数据，难以充分利用大规模未标记数据学习判别性细胞核表征。

Method: 提出MUSE方法，核心是NuLo机制——基于预测细胞核位置的坐标引导局部自蒸馏，无需严格空间对齐即可实现跨尺度对齐，结合编码器-解码器架构和大视野半监督微调策略。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试上，MUSE不仅超越了最先进的监督基线方法，还优于通用的病理学基础模型。

Conclusion: MUSE有效解决了组织病理学细胞核检测与分类的核心挑战，为病理学应用提供了强大的自监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OregairuChar数据集，用于分析动漫《我的青春恋爱物语果然有问题》中角色出现频率，包含1600帧手动标注图像，涵盖11个主要角色的2860个边界框。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色出现频率分析对于理解动漫叙事结构、角色突出度和故事进展至关重要，但缺乏专门的数据集来支持此类研究。

Method: 构建了包含1600帧手动选择图像的数据集，标注了11个主要角色的2860个边界框，并利用目标检测模型进行基准测试，用于细粒度的集级角色存在时间分析。

Result: 数据集捕捉了遮挡、姿态变化和角色间相似性等视觉挑战，通过模型预测揭示了角色突出度的模式及其在叙事中的演变。

Conclusion: OregairuChar通过强调出现频率分析，为探索计算叙事动态和风格化媒体中以角色为中心的叙事提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding
narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third
season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters.
OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

TL;DR: WtL2是一种改进的轮廓跟踪算法，专门用于红外和RGB图像中船舶及各种物体的精细分割，通过轮廓跟踪替代传统非极大值抑制，生成1像素宽的闭合形状进行分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展原始WtL算法，使其不仅能处理彩色图像中的船舶分割，还能适应红外图像并扩展到RGB图像中的各种物体，满足需要精细分割或高质量样本的专业应用需求。

Method: 改进原始WtL的轮廓跟踪算法，调整物体轮廓检测器以处理红外船舶，增强算法处理各种RGB物体的能力，通过轮廓跟踪生成可二值化的1像素宽闭合形状。

Result: WtL2在实现闭合物体轮廓时优于最新一代基于轮廓的方法，提供高峰值IoU和令人印象深刻的细节，适用于需要详细分割的专业应用。

Conclusion: WtL2是一个有吸引力的方法，可用于需要精细分割或高质量样本的专业应用，有望加速图像分割中几个利基领域的进展。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2是一个代理式多模态模型，通过两阶段训练方法（冷启动阶段和强化学习阶段）实现稳健的工具调用行为，在真实世界理解、数学推理和搜索密集型任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理式多模态模型不仅需要理解文本和图像，还需要主动调用外部工具（如代码执行环境和网络搜索）并将这些操作整合到推理过程中。

Method: 采用两阶段训练管道：冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式，强化学习阶段进一步优化工具调用。构建了多样化、适度挑战性的训练数据集，并引入RealX-Bench基准来评估真实世界的多模态推理能力。

Result: DeepEyesV2在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中表现有效，展示了任务自适应的工具调用能力，倾向于在感知任务中使用图像操作，在推理任务中使用数值计算。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够实现复杂的工具组合，并允许模型根据上下文有选择地调用工具。这项研究为开发代理式多模态模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

TL;DR: FreeControl是一个无需训练的扩散模型框架，通过单步注意力提取和潜在条件解耦实现高效的结构控制，支持组合控制且兼容现代扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet依赖手工制作的条件图和重新训练，限制了灵活性和泛化能力；基于反转的方法虽然对齐效果更好但推理成本高。

Method: FreeControl从单个最优关键时间步执行一步注意力提取并在整个去噪过程中重用；引入潜在条件解耦(LCD)分离关键时间步和噪声潜在表示；支持通过多源参考图像进行组合控制。

Result: FreeControl实现了结构和语义对齐、视觉连贯的生成，直接从原始图像生成，支持直观的场景布局设计，与现有扩散模型兼容且仅增加约5%的成本。

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制引入了新范式，无需反转或重新训练即可实现高效的结构控制，具有更好的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Motivation: 现有在线视频大语言模型难以同时处理连续帧输入并确定最佳响应时机，往往牺牲实时响应性和叙事连贯性。

Method: LiveStar包含：1）支持可变长度视频流增量视频-语言对齐的训练策略；2）通过单次前向传播验证确定最佳主动响应时机的响应-静默解码框架；3）基于峰值-末端内存压缩的内存感知加速和流式键值缓存。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了现有点云生成评估指标（特别是基于Chamfer距离的指标）的不足，提出了改进的评估方法（DCD和SNC），并开发了新的Diffusion Point Transformer模型，在ShapeNet数据集上取得了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的广泛应用，需要更可靠的生成模型评估指标。现有基于Chamfer距离的指标对缺陷不鲁棒，无法准确捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性。

Method: 1) 在距离计算前引入样本对齐；2) 用密度感知Chamfer距离（DCD）替代传统CD；3) 提出表面法线一致性（SNC）指标；4) 基于transformer架构开发Diffusion Point Transformer生成模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的实验表明，提出的评估方法更全面可靠，Diffusion Point Transformer模型在生成点云质量方面超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的生成架构，本文为点云生成领域提供了更可靠的评估框架和更高质量的生成模型，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门为工业异常检测设计的预训练表示学习框架，通过角度和范数导向的对比损失来最大化正常与异常特征之间的差异，并在大规模异常检测数据集上进行预训练，以解决ImageNet预训练与异常检测任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的异常检测方法依赖于ImageNet预训练的特征网络，但ImageNet预训练过程与异常检测目标不匹配（自然图像预训练不旨在区分正常与异常），且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致ImageNet预训练特征在异常检测任务中表现次优。

Method: 提出角度和范数导向的对比损失，同时最大化正常与异常特征之间的角度大小和范数差异；在大规模异常检测数据集RealIAD上进行预训练；基于类泛化表示（残差特征）学习预训练表示，以缓解预训练数据与下游数据集之间的潜在偏移。

Result: 在五个异常检测数据集和五个骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，使用本文预训练特征的嵌入式异常检测方法均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的专门针对异常检测任务的预训练表示学习框架能够生成鲁棒且具有区分性的特征，显著提升异常检测性能，为异常检测领域的发展提供了有价值的预训练表示。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中准确描绘结直肠肝转移瘤对实现阴性切缘至关重要，但术中超声因对比度低、噪声和操作者依赖性而具有挑战性。自动分割可提高超声导航工作流程的精度和效率。

Method: 使用85名患者的追踪3D术中超声数据，通过nnU-Net框架训练3D U-Net。比较两种变体：完整超声体积训练和肿瘤周围裁剪区域训练。评估指标包括Dice系数、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差异。

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于完整体积模型（AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC = 0.74，召回率 = 0.79，HDist. = 17.1 mm，性能与半自动分割相当但速度快约4倍（约1分钟）。前瞻性测试确认了稳健一致的性能。

Conclusion: 基于裁剪3D U-Net的术中超声自动3D分割提供可靠、近实时的结果，实现高效、无需配准的超声导航，接近专家级精度同时大幅减少手动工作量和手术时间。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒绝环境（如行星探索）中，视觉地点识别因混叠和弱纹理而失败，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更鲁棒的循环闭合检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉检索策略：使用DINOv2特征和SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，结合SONATA-based LiDAR描述符进行几何验证，并集成显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI数据集和S3LI Vulcano数据集上的实验表明，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，并在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了良好的平衡，展示了基础模型在统一地点识别和位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Motivation: 传统自我报告方法存在回忆偏差，基于摄像头的方法涉及隐私问题，而现有可穿戴方法主要针对有限的食物类型（如汉堡、披萨），无法应对中国菜品的多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段检测流程：第一阶段通过区分特征性时间模式来识别进食状态；第二阶段基于进食过程中捕获的动作进行细粒度的食物类型识别，结合智能手表的手部动作和智能眼镜的头部动态。

Result: 在包含11个食物类别、10名参与者的27.5小时IMU记录数据集上，CuisineSense在进食状态检测和食物分类方面均实现了高精度。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案，能够有效识别多样化的中国菜品。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过将时序搜索重新定义为交错式推理过程，结合强化学习和完整性自验证，显著提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

*Huanqi Wu,Huangbiao Xu,Runfeng Xie,Jiaxin Cai,Kaixin Zhang,Xiao Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的语义隐写方法S²LM，能够将句子级别的语义信息嵌入到图像中，突破了传统比特级隐写的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AIGC时代，隐写术的容量需求日益增长，但现有方法难以嵌入语义丰富的句子级信息到载体中。

Method: 使用大语言模型设计新的管道，在整个过程中利用LLM将句子或段落级别的高级文本信息嵌入到图像中。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法有效解锁了LLMs的新语义隐写能力。

Conclusion: 提出的S²LM方法成功实现了句子到图像的语义隐写，为语义隐写开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D框架，用于4D铰接物体的全景分割，通过将物体部分映射到规范空间来提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了铰接物体的时间动态特性，缺乏4D时间数据的探索和基准数据集，限制了铰接物体感知的发展。

Method: 提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计每帧偏移将观察到的物体部分映射到学习的规范空间，实现跨帧的物体部分一致对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景的全景分割精度上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有有效性，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了密集运动描述任务，创建了CompMo数据集和DEMO模型，在3D人体运动理解方面取得了显著进展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人体运动与语言集成的研究主要集中在文本到运动生成，而运动理解任务相对未被充分探索，现有数据集缺乏详细的时间标注且多为短序列

Method: 构建了CompMo数据集（包含6万个复杂运动序列），提出了DEMO模型（将大语言模型与简单运动适配器集成）

Result: DEMO模型在CompMo数据集和适应基准上显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 为3D运动理解和描述的未来研究建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

### [57] [PreResQ-R1: Towards Fine-Grained Rank-and-Score Reinforcement Learning for Visual Quality Assessment via Preference-Response Disentangled Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05393)
*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PreResQ-R1框架，通过偏好-响应解耦的强化学习统一绝对分数回归和相对排序一致性，在视觉质量评估任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用双分支奖励公式，分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化进行优化，并设计了全局-时间和局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 仅在6K图像和28K视频上进行强化学习微调，就在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得最先进结果，IQA任务中SRCC和PLCC指标分别提升5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALM是一个大规模手部数据集，包含263名受试者的13,000个高质量手部扫描和90,000张多视角图像，用于解决手部建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂的手部几何、外观和关节结构，特别是在无约束光照和有限视角下，从图像创建高质量个性化手部化身仍然具有挑战性。现有数据集缺乏准确的3D几何、高分辨率多视角图像和多样化的受试者群体。

Method: 提出了PALM数据集和PALM-Net基线模型，通过基于物理的逆向渲染学习多受试者的手部几何和材质属性先验，实现逼真、可重照明的单图像手部化身个性化。

Result: PALM数据集捕获了丰富的肤色、年龄和几何变化，其规模和多样性使其成为手部建模及相关研究的宝贵真实世界资源。

Conclusion: PALM数据集解决了手部建模中的数据稀缺问题，为逼真的单图像手部化身个性化提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种持续学习图像恢复方法，通过简单修改卷积层来适应新任务，无需改变主干架构，在保持现有任务性能的同时提升新任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在图像恢复领域存在不足，需要大量工程化架构修改，计算开销大。正则化方法不适用于恢复任务，因为不同恢复问题需要不同的特征处理方式。

Method: 通过简单修改卷积层来适应先前恢复任务的知识，无需改变主干架构，可无缝应用于任何深度架构。增加可训练参数但不会显著增加计算开销或推理时间。

Result: 实验验证表明，可以引入新的恢复任务而不影响现有任务的性能。通过适应先前恢复任务创建的知识库，新恢复任务的性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像恢复领域的持续学习提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在保持计算效率的同时实现知识积累和任务适应。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于HierSpeech++潜在语音表示的文本到说话人脸合成框架，通过两阶段训练处理特征分布偏移，实现紧密的音视频对齐和自然的面部运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统级联管道在文本到说话人脸合成中存在的音视频对齐不足和视觉真实感差的问题，通过联合条件生成实现更好的同步效果。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练：先在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，然后在TTS输出上微调，以处理干净特征和TTS预测特征之间的分布偏移。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测潜在特征的条件下，在唇同步和视觉真实感方面均优于级联管道方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在推理时无需真实音频，生成自然、富有表现力的语音和同步的面部运动，同时保持说话人身份。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D点云transformer模型依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂，研究发现令牌存在显著冗余。

Method: 引入gitmerge3D方法，采用全局感知的图令牌合并技术来减少令牌数量。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中验证，令牌数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性能，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 挑战了更多令牌必然带来更好性能的普遍假设，揭示了当前模型存在过度令牌化和可扩展性优化不足的问题，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 该研究验证了中分辨率Copernicus卫星图像（Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2）可用于建筑物损坏评估，并发布了xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对灾前灾后图像对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，而超高分辨率图像往往可用性有限，因此研究中分辨率图像作为补充数据源的可行性。

Method: 创建xBD-S12数据集，与现有xBD基准进行时空对齐，通过一系列实验评估中分辨率图像在建筑物损坏检测和制图方面的表现。

Result: 研究表明在10米地面采样距离下，许多灾害场景中建筑物损坏能够被较好地检测和制图，复杂模型架构在泛化到未见灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际效益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速、广域损坏评估的可行数据源，可与超高分辨率图像协同发挥作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Motivation: 传统基于场景的图像年代估计方法存在局限性，而人脸包含丰富的时序信息（如年龄、身份），可以更准确地推断照片拍摄时间。

Method: 构建CSFD-1.6M数据集（160万标注人脸），提出概率框架结合人脸识别、年龄估计模型和职业时间先验，通过多脸信息聚合推断拍摄年份。

Result: 多脸信息聚合显著提升性能，在包含多个可识别个体的图像上表现优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 人脸信息是图像年代估计的有效线索，多脸信息聚合能提供更可靠的年代推断，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的图像中。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流沸腾是高效传热机制，但流型突变会破坏热性能，需要准确低延迟的实时监测。传统光学方法计算量大、时间分辨率不足，无法捕捉瞬态流动行为

Method: 开发五种分类模型，比较传统图像数据和事件数据。神经形态传感器检测像素亮度变化，无需全帧重建，提供基于事件的信息

Result: 基于事件数据的模型优于帧基方法，对动态流动特征更敏感。事件LSTM模型在准确性和速度间最佳平衡，达到97.6%准确率和0.28ms处理时间

Conclusion: 异步处理管道支持连续低延迟预测，通过多数投票机制提供稳定输出，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠实时反馈

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN是一种轻量级医学图像分割网络，通过分组KAN变换和分组KAN激活模块，解决了U-KAN的O(C^2)复杂度问题，在减少参数的同时提升了分割精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要准确、轻量且可解释的模型。卷积架构缺乏自适应非线性，Transformer架构存在二次复杂度和不透明注意力机制的问题。U-KAN虽然解决了这些问题，但其全通道变换导致的O(C^2)复杂度限制了可扩展性。

Method: 提出GroupKAN网络，包含两个新模块：(1)分组KAN变换：将通道分成G组进行多元样条映射，复杂度降至O(C^2/G)；(2)分组KAN激活：在每个通道组内应用共享的样条映射，实现高效的token-wise非线性。

Result: 在三个医学基准测试(BUSI、GlaS、CVC)上，GroupKAN平均IoU达到79.80%，比U-KAN提升1.11%，参数仅需3.02M(为U-KAN的47.6%)，并显示出更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GroupKAN通过结构化功能模块有效解决了U-KAN的复杂度问题，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少参数，为医学图像分割提供了更轻量、可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared

TL;DR: 提出了Visual Spatial Tuning (VST)框架，通过构建大规模空间感知数据集VST-P(410万样本)和空间推理数据集VST-R(13.5万样本)，采用渐进式训练方法增强视觉语言模型的空间能力，在多个空间基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强视觉语言模型的空间感知和推理能力是实现类人通用智能的关键。现有方法通常需要添加额外专家编码器，这会带来额外开销并损害通用能力。

Method: 构建VST-P数据集(410万样本，涵盖19种空间技能)和VST-R数据集(13.5万样本)，采用渐进式训练：监督微调建立基础空间知识，强化学习提升空间推理能力。

Result: 在多个空间基准测试中达到SOTA：MMSI-Bench上34.8%，VSIBench上61.2%，且不损害模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: VST框架显著增强了视觉-语言-动作模型的空间能力，为更物理接地的人工智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [68] [Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning Over Ordered Procedural Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04688)
*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在从打乱的步骤中重建程序序列的能力，使用食谱作为测试领域，发现模型性能随序列长度增加和步骤位移加剧而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究程序性推理能力对大型语言模型至关重要，特别是在步骤顺序直接影响结果的领域。

Method: 使用食谱数据集评估多个LLM在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，采用Kendall's Tau、NLCS和NED等排序和序列对齐指标。

Result: 模型性能随序列长度增加而下降，输入步骤位移越大性能越差，表明当前LLM在程序推理方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在处理较长和更混乱的程序序列时存在显著限制，需要改进程序推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个基于项目反应理论的自适应测试框架，通过Fisher信息引导的项目选择来评估大语言模型能力，能在保持测量精度的同时减少90%的测试项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型评估需要数千个基准项目，成本高且效率低，且所有项目被同等对待，忽略了项目质量和信息量的差异。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)和Fisher信息指导的项目选择，动态选择最具信息量的测试项目来估计模型能力。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上仅用42个项目就能匹配全基准估计，平均绝对误差0.154；项目暴露率低于10%，测试重叠率16-27%；IRT排名与传统准确率排名存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架显著提高了大语言模型评估的效率，揭示了传统静态基准中存在的项目质量问题，并为更精确的模型比较提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at

TL;DR: 提出SARC框架，通过情感增强的深度聚类识别用户角色，结合角色聚类和假新闻检测的联合优化目标，提升假新闻检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将情感特征作为辅助信号，忽略了角色分化问题——相同情感极性可能来自不同角色的用户，限制了捕捉细微模式的能力。

Method: SARC框架：1) 通过联合评论文本表示和情感编码生成用户特征；2) 构建可微分深度聚类模块自动分类用户角色；3) 提出结合角色聚类和假新闻检测的联合优化目标。

Result: 在RumourEval-19和Weibo-comp两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，SARC在所有指标上都优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SARC框架通过考虑用户角色分化，有效提升了假新闻检测性能，证明了情感增强角色聚类方法的有效性。

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过推理任务来增强大语言模型的指令层次执行能力，使用VerIH数据集进行轻量级强化学习训练，使模型能够优先遵循高级别系统指令而非用户请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实决策中承担重要角色，需要解决来自多个来源（如开发者、用户、工具）的竞争性指令冲突问题，确保高级别指令能够覆盖低优先级请求，这对LLM的可靠性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 将指令层次解析重构为推理任务，构建VerIH数据集（包含对齐和冲突的系统-用户指令），通过轻量级强化学习训练模型在生成响应前先思考用户提示与系统指令的关系。

Result: 微调后的模型在指令遵循和指令层次基准测试中取得一致改进，推理能力能够泛化到训练分布之外的安全关键场景，增强了对越狱和提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过指令层次推理为构建可靠LLM提供了一条实用路径，系统提示的更新能够产生可控且鲁棒的模型行为变化。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个微调的BERT模型来分析播客中的叙事框架，通过将框架与具体实体关联来更准确地识别对话中的叙事结构，揭示了话题与呈现方式之间的系统性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 播客已成为影响公众舆论的重要媒介，但其即兴、多主题和对话式的特点使得自动化分析面临挑战，现有语言模型难以准确捕捉人类听众依赖的微妙线索来识别叙事框架。

Method: 开发并评估了一个微调的BERT模型，将叙事框架明确链接到对话中提到的具体实体，从而将抽象框架锚定在具体细节上，然后使用这些细粒度框架标签并与高级主题相关联。

Result: 该方法在分析混乱的对话数据时更符合人类判断，能够揭示话题内容与呈现方式之间的系统性关系。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的框架标注方法，为研究数字媒体中的影响力提供了更强大的分析框架，能够更准确地分析播客叙事结构并理解当代话语趋势。

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从社交媒体文本中早期检测心理健康障碍对于及时提供支持、风险评估和转介到适当资源至关重要。

Method: 基于多个精选数据集，使用微调的RoBERTa模型进行多类别分类，并与传统机器学习方法、领域特定transformer和基于提示的大语言模型进行比较。

Result: multiMentalRoBERTa在六分类设置中宏观F1分数达到0.839，在五分类设置中达到0.870，优于微调的MentalBERT和基线分类器。

Conclusion: 微调的transformer模型在敏感情境下提供了可靠且可解释的检测解决方案，同时强调了公平性、偏见缓解和人工参与安全协议的重要性。

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

TL;DR: WinnowRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过两阶段过滤机制解决多文档检索中的噪声问题，提高生成响应的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法通过增加检索文档数量来提高相关信息获取概率，但会引入大量噪声文档，降低生成响应的准确性。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段进行查询感知聚类，将相似文档分组并由LLM代理生成答案；第二阶段通过批评LLM评估多个代理输出，迭代分离有用文档与噪声文档，并采用策略性合并技术保留有用文档。

Result: 在多个现实数据集上的广泛实验表明，WinnowRAG在效果上优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: WinnowRAG是一个模型无关且无需微调的框架，能有效过滤噪声文档并保留有价值内容，显著提升RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite
designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios.
Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major
advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive,
up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS

on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a
cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental
deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating

Conclusion: 有效的提示设计和针对性指令微调可以在保持高可扩展性和适应性的同时显著提升性能，使GEMMA-SQL成为强大且可访问的文本到SQL系统的实用开源替代方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems enable users to interact with structured databases using
natural language, eliminating the need for specialized programming knowledge.
In this work, we introduce GEMMA-SQL, a lightweight and efficient text-to-SQL
model built upon the open-source Gemma 2B architecture. Unlike many large
language models (LLMs), GEMMA-SQL is fine-tuned in a resource-efficient,
iterative manner and can be deployed on low-cost hardware. Leveraging the
SPIDER benchmark for training and evaluation, GEMMA-SQL combines multiple
prompting strategies, including few-shot learning, to enhance SQL query
generation accuracy. The instruction-tuned variant, GEMMA-SQL Instruct,
achieves 66.8% Test-Suite accuracy and 63.3% Exact Set Match accuracy,
outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines such as IRNet, RYANSQL, and
CodeXDavinci. The proposed approach demonstrates that effective prompt design
and targeted instruction tuning can significantly boost performance while
maintaining high scalability and adaptability. These results position GEMMA-SQL
as a practical, open-source alternative for robust and accessible text-to-SQL
systems.

*Dmytro Vitel,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了先前关于LLM影响函数计算的观点，证明中间注意力层比嵌入层更适合用于训练样本影响估计，并提出新的评估指标和聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型训练样本影响估计方法由于计算复杂度高，通常只能计算部分层的影响。先前研究认为嵌入层最适合，但本文发现这种基于抵消效应的假设不可靠。

Method: 提出理论和实证证据证明抵消效应的不可靠性，发现中间注意力层是更好的影响估计器。提出替代标准平均的排名和投票方法，并引入无需重新训练的新评估指标NDR。

Result: 通过在不同类型和规模的LLM上进行广泛实验，确定第一层（嵌入层）不一定比最后一层更适合LLM影响估计，这与先前认知形成对比。

Conclusion: 中间注意力层比嵌入层更适合用于LLM训练样本影响估计，新的聚合方法和NDR指标能显著提升性能，为模型解释和数据集审计提供更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于检索增强诊断推理的智能体系统，用于脑部MRI中的罕见疾病检测。该系统通过嵌入病例报告和医学文献，利用相似性搜索为AI模型提供外部医学知识，无需额外训练即可提升罕见疾病的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病在医学影像中数据稀缺，导致AI模型表现不佳。放射科医生在遇到不熟悉的发现时通常会查阅病例报告和文献，因此需要开发能够模拟这种临床推理过程的系统。

Method: 使用句子变换器嵌入病例报告和医学文献，并通过FAISS进行索引以实现高效相似性搜索。AI智能体检索临床相关证据来指导诊断决策，作为一个模型无关的推理模块，可与各种大型语言模型无缝集成。

Result: 在包含280种不同罕见疾病的NOVA数据集上，RADAR实现了高达10.2%的性能提升，特别是对开源模型如DeepSeek的改进最为显著。检索到的示例提供了可解释的、基于文献的解释。

Conclusion: 检索增强推理是医学影像中低流行率条件的强大范式，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于惊奇值方差的图像描述语言多样性度量方法，发现在不同评分器下人类和模型的多样性比较结果会完全相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化图像描述任务中的语言多样性，比较人类和模型在生成多样性方面的差异，并揭示单一评分器可能导致错误结论的问题。

Method: 使用惊奇值方差（token级负对数概率的分布）作为多样性度量，在MSCOCO测试集上比较5个最先进的视觉语言大模型与人类描述，使用n-gram语言模型和通用语言模型进行评分。

Result: 使用描述训练的语言模型时，人类的惊奇值方差大约是模型的两倍；但使用通用语言模型重新评分时，模式完全反转。单一评分器可能导致结论完全颠倒。

Conclusion: 需要报告多个评分器下的惊奇值来进行稳健的多样性评估，单一评分器可能得出完全相反的结论。

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

TL;DR: ERPO框架通过探索残差提示来增强RLVR训练效果，解决了长期训练中残差提示（零方差奖励）无法提供训练信号的问题，在数学推理基准上超越强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型训练时间延长和规模扩大，越来越多的训练提示变成残差提示（零方差奖励），这些提示无法提供训练信号，导致训练提示多样性减少，影响训练效果。

Method: 提出ERPO框架，为每个提示维护历史追踪器，自适应地增加残差提示的采样温度，鼓励模型生成更多样化的推理轨迹，引入错误响应以重新激活训练信号。

Result: 在Qwen2.5系列上的实证结果表明，ERPO在多个数学推理基准上持续超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: ERPO通过有效利用残差提示，增强了RLVR训练的效果，为大规模语言模型的强化学习训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现基础LLMs在语义层面具有良好校准能力，能够有意义地评估开放域问答任务的置信度，尽管它们并未被明确训练这样做。理论机制解释了语义校准如何作为下一个token预测的副产品出现，并预测了三种可验证的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通常缺乏对其输出的有意义的置信度估计。虽然已知基础LLMs在下一个token层面具有校准能力，但不清楚它们是否能够在超越token层面的实际意义层面评估置信度。

Method: 使用基于采样的语义校准概念，建立理论机制解释语义校准如何从下一个token预测中产生，提出B-校准的一般定义，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 基础LLMs在问答任务中具有语义校准能力；RL指令微调会系统性破坏这种校准；思维链推理也会破坏校准。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为LLMs中语义校准何时以及为何出现提供了原则性解释，揭示了基础LLMs的内在语义校准能力及其在后续训练中的脆弱性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs可以通过单秩LoRA适配器可靠地诱导行为自我意识，这种能力表现为激活空间中的线性特征，且具有任务特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs行为自我意识出现的最小条件和机制过程，因为这种能力可能带来安全风险，如模型在评估时更好地隐藏真实能力。

Method: 在指令调优的LLMs上使用低秩适配器进行受控微调实验，分析自我意识的诱导和表征机制。

Result: 发现：(1)使用单秩LoRA适配器可可靠诱导自我意识；(2)学习到的自我意识行为可由激活空间中的单个导向向量捕获；(3)自我意识是非普适且领域局部的，在不同任务间有独立表征。

Conclusion: 行为自我意识作为领域特定的线性特征出现，可以轻松诱导和调节。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SDS KoPub VDR，这是首个针对韩文公共文档的大规模公开检索基准，包含361个真实文档（40,781页）和600个经过人工验证的查询-页面-答案三元组，支持文本检索和多模态检索任务评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉文档检索基准主要关注英文，忽视了非英语语言和官方出版物的结构复杂性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 基于361个真实韩文公共文档构建语料库，使用多模态模型生成查询并经过严格人工验证，建立包含文本检索和多模态检索的双任务评估框架。

Result: 评估显示即使在最先进模型中也存在显著的性能差距，特别是在需要跨模态推理的多模态场景中。

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR为复杂真实世界文档智能中的多模态AI发展提供了基础资源和明确路线图。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

TL;DR: BudgetMem是一种内存增强架构，通过选择性记忆策略和基于特征的显著性评分来学习记住什么，而不是记住所有内容，在严格预算约束下显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时面临显著的计算和内存限制，尽管对需要推理长文档、多会话对话和书籍长度文本的应用需求不断增长。

Method: 结合选择性记忆策略与基于特征的显著性评分（实体密度、TF-IDF、话语标记、位置偏差），使用学习门控机制和BM25稀疏检索进行高效信息访问。

Result: 在700个问答对上的实验表明，BudgetMem在长文档上仅产生1.0% F1分数下降，同时节省72.4%内存，且随着文档长度增加，其优势更加明显。

Conclusion: BudgetMem为在有限硬件上部署能力强的长上下文系统提供了实用途径，使先进语言理解能力更加普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Result: 构建的数据集覆盖了过去五年顶级AI会议中85%使用的基准和数据集，在Recall@20和HitRate@5指标上分别比最强基线提升了5.85%和8.30%。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了实验设计的可靠、可解释自动化，通过利用学术网络中的集体感知显著改善了基准和数据集推荐的质量。

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为最大的开放知识图谱，其宽松的编辑政策导致了分类不一致问题，需要系统化的方法来识别和纠正这些错误。

Method: 提出并应用新的验证方法确认分类错误，引入评估标准判断问题是否需要修正，开发用户检查系统。

Result: 确认了Wikidata特定领域存在分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接问题。

Conclusion: 通过利用Wikidata众包性质开发的系统，可以有效识别和纠正知识图谱中的分类不一致问题。

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理场景对大型语言模型越来越重要，但带来了显著的计算延迟。现有并行分词方法通过文本分割和多进程分词加速处理，但由于边界伪影导致合并后结果不一致。

Method: 提出LoPT框架，采用基于字符位置的匹配和动态块长度调整来准确对齐和合并分词片段，确保输出与标准顺序分词完全相同。

Result: 在多种长文本数据集上的广泛实验表明，LoPT实现了显著的加速，同时保证无损分词。

Conclusion: LoPT通过理论一致性证明和全面分析研究验证了方法的鲁棒性，为解决长序列推理中的分词瓶颈提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在扮演非亲社会、反派角色时的能力限制，因为现代LLMs的安全对齐可能与真实角色扮演任务产生根本性冲突。

Method: 引入Moral RolePlay基准测试，包含四级道德对齐量表和平衡测试集，让最先进的LLMs扮演从道德典范到纯粹反派的不同角色。

Result: 评估显示随着角色道德水平下降，角色扮演保真度单调递减。模型在与安全原则直接冲突的特质上表现最差，往往用表面攻击性替代微妙的恶意。高度安全对齐的模型在反派角色扮演上表现特别差。

Conclusion: 研究首次系统性地证明了模型安全性与创意保真度之间的关键张力，为开发更细致、上下文感知的对齐方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

*Prasoon Varshney,Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar,Liwei Jiang,Traian Rebedea,Christopher Parisien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE)评估套件，用于系统评估大语言模型在多轮交互对话中遵循多元化对齐规范的能力，发现现有模型在多轮对抗性交互中合规性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM应用通常发生在具有独特企业政策、监管要求、使用场景、品牌指南和道德承诺的组织生态系统中，这凸显了对具有多元化对齐目标的LLM进行严格评估的需求。

Method: 开发了PBSUITE评估套件，包含：(1)基于30个行业的300个现实LLM行为策略数据集；(2)在对抗条件下压力测试模型对自定义行为规范合规性的动态评估框架。

Result: 领先的开源和闭源LLM在单轮设置中保持强大的行为策略遵循能力（失败率低于4%），但在多轮对抗性交互中合规性显著减弱（失败率高达84%）。

Conclusion: 现有的模型对齐和安全调节方法在现实世界LLM交互中连贯执行多元化行为策略方面存在不足，需要开发更稳健和情境感知的多元化对齐技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

*Jinglin Liang,Jin Zhong,Shuangping Huang,Yunqing Hu,Huiyuan Zhang,Huifang Li,Lixin Fan,Hanlin Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在显著相似性，提出了基于注意力展开的Order-Level Attention(OLA)概念，并开发了无需训练的跨模型适配器TOA，能够有效提升未见语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常关注单个语言模型或注意力头的上下文聚合模式，缺乏对不同模型间共性的系统性分析。探索语言模型间的共性有助于加深对模型的理解并促进跨模型知识迁移。

Method: 提出了Order-Level Attention(OLA)概念，源自注意力展开的按阶分解。发现不同语言模型在相同阶数的OLA上存在显著相似性，并揭示了OLA与句法知识之间的隐式映射关系。基于此开发了Transferable OLA Adapter(TOA)方法。

Result: 实验证明，不同语言模型在相同阶数的OLA上表现出显著相似性。TOA方法能够在不更新参数的情况下泛化到未见过的语言模型，有效提升其性能。

Conclusion: 语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在共性，OLA可作为统一的句法特征表示。TOA方法利用这种共性实现了跨模型的无训练适配器迁移，为语言模型的理解和知识迁移提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多语言虚假信息检测的声明规范化方法，通过系统分解社交媒体帖子为可验证陈述，在仅使用英语数据训练的情况下实现了20种语言的跨语言迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言虚假信息检测中的声明规范化问题，将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子转化为清晰可验证的陈述，实现跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 使用Qwen3-14B模型进行LoRA微调，结合帖子内去重、基于召回率的语义对齐过滤，以及在推理时使用检索增强的少样本学习。

Result: 在20种语言上取得METEOR分数从41.16（英语）到15.21（马拉地语），英语排行榜第三名，荷兰语和旁遮普语第四名，相比基线配置相对提升41.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在罗曼语系和日耳曼语系语言上表现出有效的跨语言泛化能力，同时在不同语言结构中保持语义连贯性。

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

*P. Bilha Githinji,Aikaterini Meilliou,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了两种通用大语言模型在文本简化任务中的表现，发现指令调优的Mistral 24B在可读性和语篇保真度方面表现更优，而推理增强的QWen2.5 32B在平衡可读性和准确性方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公众健康信息寻求行为和数字消费的增加，需要可扩展的解决方案来自动将复杂的科学和技术文档转换为通俗语言，但现有文本简化方法在优化可读性和保持语篇保真度之间存在挑战。

Method: 使用指令调优的Mistral 24B和推理增强的QWen2.5 32B两种通用LLM进行对比分析，评估其在文本简化任务中的表现，并与人类基准进行比较。

Result: Mistral在简化特定指标SARI上达到平均42.46分，BERTScore为0.91，接近人类水平；QWen虽然可读性有所提升，但BERTScore显著较低（0.89），在平衡可读性和准确性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 指令调优的Mistral 24B在文本简化任务中表现更优，研究为指标选择提供了启发，并指出词汇支持是简化的主要领域适应问题。

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ShortGPT的改进蒸馏方法，通过迭代评估层重要性来压缩大语言模型，在Qwen2.5-3B上成功将层数从36减少到28（参数量2.47B），质量损失仅9.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发紧凑模型以保持高性能，解决大语言模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Method: 基于ShortGPT的改进方法，通过迭代评估层重要性（移除单层测量性能下降），结合KL散度和均方误差的联合损失函数进行进一步训练。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B模型上，层数从36减少到28（参数量2.47B）时质量损失9.7%，减少到24层时损失18%。发现中间transformer层对推理贡献较小。

Conclusion: 迭代蒸馏和微调方法有效，适合资源受限环境部署，证明了中间层可压缩性，为高效模型创建提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 现有进化提示优化方法缺乏鲁棒的操作符和高效的评估机制，需要改进以提升整体性能。

Method: 1) 将进化分解为不同步骤以增强控制和进化效果；2) 引入基于LLM的评审来验证进化结果；3) 整合人类反馈来精炼进化操作符；4) 开发保持性能但减少计算开销的高效评估策略。

Result: 该方法在优化质量和效率方面均有提升，代码已开源支持新任务的提示优化和进一步研究。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法能够有效提升进化提示优化的性能，为通用提示优化提供了可部分推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用Transformer编码器在制造等专业领域表现不佳，因为缺乏领域特定术语和语义的暴露。

Method: 构建制造领域大规模语料库，包括领域特定过滤和多阶段去重处理，然后对RoBERTa模型进行持续预训练。

Result: ManufactuBERT在制造相关NLP任务中建立了新的最先进性能，去重后的语料库使训练收敛加速，训练时间和计算成本减少33%。

Conclusion: 提出的管道为在其他专业领域开发高性能编码器提供了可复制的示例，模型和语料库将公开发布。

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

TL;DR: 本文研究发现多语言数学基准测试MGSM中存在翻译错误和答案提取标准化问题，导致先前报道的LLMs跨语言性能差距实际上是虚假的。通过提出自动质量保证方法和标准化答案提取建议，作者证明语言差距基本消失。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LLMs在不同语言数学能力上的表现差异，发现现有基准测试存在数据质量问题，导致得出错误的跨语言性能差距结论。

Method: 分析MGSM多语言数学基准测试中的翻译错误，提出自动质量保证方法，并给出标准化答案提取建议。

Result: 修正数据质量和标准化答案提取后，先前报道的LLMs跨语言性能差距基本消失，得出了与原始研究完全不同的结论。

Conclusion: 多语言基准测试的数据质量和评估方法标准化至关重要，当前报道的LLMs跨语言能力差距主要是由这些技术问题造成的，而非模型本身的能力差异。

Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages
in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German,
Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In
addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains,
like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example
domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages.
Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap
in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat
against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages.
We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual
capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact
that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math
benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in
the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM
outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic
quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations
to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the
aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different
conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to
the community.

Conclusion: 思维链提示在知识蒸馏中发挥了重要作用，能够有效将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到小语言模型，提升其在复杂推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

Method: 引入基于LLM的标注管道，从数字化开源翻译数据构建新数据集，在低资源设置下引入辅助中文NLP任务。

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating

fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文注入的LLM个性化方法让模型同时承担内容生成和风格对齐的双重负担，导致输出质量下降和控制精度受限。

Method: 提出RPO框架：1) 基础模型生成通用高质量回答；2) 外部反射模块重写输出以对齐用户偏好；3) 通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练反射模块。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试上的综合实验表明，RPO显著优于最先进的基线方法，证明了显式响应塑造优于隐式上下文注入。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一种高效、模型无关的个性化层，可与任何基础模型无缝集成，为用户中心生成场景开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事司法行政数据中关于犯罪行为的详细信息有限，而大陆法系法院判决书中包含丰富的犯罪行为描述，这些信息尚未被充分利用。

Method: 使用两种方法提取描述：正则表达式（基础版和高级版）和大型语言模型（Gemini Flash 2.0）。高级正则表达式关注"sparing"及其规范化，LLM使用预定义指令进行提取。

Result: 基础正则表达式仅识别40.5%的描述，高级正则表达式达到97%，LLM达到98.75%，两者结合达到99.5%。法学学生评估显示高级方法与人工标注匹配率约90%，而基础方法仅34.5%。

Conclusion: 从公开法院判决中提取犯罪行为描述是可行的，正则表达式和LLM都能有效完成任务，两者结合效果最佳。

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词器（如SentencePiece或HuggingFace BPE）主要针对拉丁语或多语言语料库设计，在形态丰富的语言（如孟加拉语）上表现不佳。

Method: BengaliBPE应用Unicode规范化、字素级初始化和形态感知合并规则，以保持语言一致性和保留子词完整性。

Result: 与Whitespace、SentencePiece BPE和HuggingFace BPE相比，BengaliBPE提供了最详细的分割和最佳的形态可解释性，但计算成本略高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言感知分词对于形态丰富脚本的重要性，并将BengaliBPE确立为未来孟加拉语NLP系统的坚实基础。

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨多语言者的心理词典结构，特别关注视觉输入在翻译任务中对语言习得的影响，通过多层网络模型分析视觉模态如何影响多语言习得。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为双语会增加认知负担，但近30年研究表明多语言者在语言和认知任务中表现更优。本研究旨在探索多语言心理词典的结构，特别是视觉输入对语言习得的影响。

Method: 基于Stella等人的心理词典多路复用模型和BIA+框架，应用Kivela的多层网络原则，在模型中引入视觉模态层，将视觉输入与多语言层的词汇表征连接。

Result: 研究设计扩展了先前研究，通过包含视觉输入的多路复用模型来探索视觉输入在翻译任务中对语言熟练度和准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在验证视觉输入是否比纯文本条件更能影响参与者在翻译任务中的语言熟练度和准确性，特别关注遗产语言对另一语言习得的影响。

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全机制难以应对日益复杂的网络威胁，LLM在文本处理和生成方面的先进能力为网络安全提供了重要潜力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成技术将实时信息检索与领域特定数据相结合，构建RAGRecon系统，为每个回答生成可视化知识图谱。

Result: 在两个数据集和七个不同LLM上的实验评估显示，最佳组合的响应与参考响应匹配率超过91%。

Conclusion: RAGRecon系统成功展示了LLM与RAG结合在网络安全威胁情报获取中的有效性，并通过知识图谱提高了AI决策的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security
mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text
processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon
experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses
matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best
combinations.

*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架来建模个体和群体层面的用户满意度偏好，通过个性化推理链和多数-少数偏好感知聚类来提升对话系统的用户满意度估计，特别是对少数群体的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统对齐方法通常训练通用模型追求广泛共识，但忽视了少数用户群体的特定偏好和个体差异，导致用户满意度估计存在偏差。

Method: 1) Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning(CoPeR)捕捉个体偏好；2) 基于期望最大化的多数-少数偏好感知聚类(M2PC)无监督发现用户群体；3) 偏好自适应强化学习框架(PAda-PPO)联合优化个体和群体偏好对齐。

Result: 在情感支持对话数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户满意度估计方面取得了一致性改进，特别是对代表性不足的用户群体效果显著。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了同时考虑个体和群体偏好的重要性，提出的统一框架能够有效提升对话系统的用户满意度估计准确性，特别是在处理少数群体偏好方面表现出色。

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [110] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出对比权重导向方法，通过权重算术编辑模型参数，利用窄分布训练数据实现更好的行为控制泛化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多样化训练分布上为LLMs提供高质量反馈困难且昂贵，而仅在窄分布上提供反馈会导致意外泛化问题

Method: 通过两个小规模微调的权重差值分离行为方向，然后添加或移除该方向来修改模型权重

Result: 权重导向比激活导向具有更好的泛化能力，能更强地控制分布外行为且不损害通用能力；可减少微调引入的奉承行为和拒绝不足问题

Conclusion: 权重导向是有效的后训练方法，能利用窄训练数据实现行为控制；通过权重相似性可检测训练中出现的未对齐行为

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了MIMIC-SR-ICD11数据集和LL-Rank重排框架，用于基于临床报告进行疾病诊断，通过概率评分改善诊断标签的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用患者自我报告中的临床信号，这些信号在电子健康记录模板中往往被减弱或忽略，特别是那些细微但重要的细节。

Method: 引入LL-Rank框架，计算每个标签在临床报告上下文中的长度归一化联合似然，并减去无报告时的先验似然，使用PMI评分来分离语义兼容性和标签频率偏差。

Result: 在七个模型骨干上，LL-Rank始终优于生成加映射基线(GenMap)，消融实验显示其改进主要来自PMI评分。

Conclusion: LL-Rank框架能有效利用临床报告中的语义信息，提高疾病诊断的准确性，减少标签频率偏差的影响。

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于认知不确定性的拒绝选项预测器，在数据不足导致认知不确定性高的区域拒绝预测，通过最小化期望遗憾来优化决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝选项方法只关注随机不确定性，假设训练数据充足使得认知不确定性可忽略。但在实际应用中，数据有限使得这一假设不成立，需要同时考虑认知不确定性。

Method: 基于贝叶斯学习，重新定义最优预测器为最小化期望遗憾的预测器。当给定输入的遗憾超过指定拒绝成本时，模型拒绝预测。

Result: 提出了第一个原则性框架，能够学习识别训练数据不足以做出可靠决策的输入的预测器。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险应用中处理认知不确定性提供了理论依据，使模型能够在数据不足时明智地拒绝预测。

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

TL;DR: DMA是一个在线学习框架，通过多粒度人类反馈动态调整RAG系统的检索排序，在保持基础检索能力的同时显著提升对话问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖静态检索，无法适应动态变化的用户意图和内容漂移问题，需要能够实时学习和适应的框架。

Method: DMA将文档级、列表级和响应级信号整合到统一学习流程中：监督训练点对和列表排序器、基于响应偏好的策略优化、以及知识蒸馏到轻量级评分器中。

Result: 在线工业部署显示人类参与度显著提升，离线测试在TriviaQA和HotpotQA等对话问答基准上取得明显进步，同时保持基础检索竞争力。

Conclusion: DMA为RAG系统提供了一种基于反馈驱动的实时自适应方法，在不牺牲基础能力的情况下实现持续改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的智能体需要在动态环境中同时做出逻辑性和及时性的判断，而现有语言模型推理方法未能充分考虑环境的动态特性。

Method: 构建Real-Time Reasoning Gym测试平台，研究反应式智能体（有限推理计算）和规划式智能体（扩展推理计算）两种范式，并提出AgileThinker方法同时使用两种推理范式。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型也难以在任一范式中同时做出逻辑性和及时性的判断。AgileThinker在任务难度和时间压力增加时始终优于仅使用单一推理范式的智能体。

Conclusion: 实时推理是开发实用智能体的关键测试基准，为时间约束AI系统研究提供了基础，指明了实现实时能力智能体的路径。

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Motivation: 传统专家工作流程耗时、易积压，难以跟上不断变化的监管边界，需要更高效透明的合规决策系统。

Method: 采用小型协作代理（检索、描述精炼、分类器、验证器、反馈记录器），通过MCP协议协调，实现模型无关的本地化操作。

Result: 在真实高风险财产案例的初步测试中，ORCHID相比非代理基线提高了准确性和可追溯性，同时将不确定项目转交给领域专家。

Conclusion: ORCHID展示了在敏感能源部合规工作流程中实现可信赖LLM辅助的实用路径。

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize
institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is
crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation
is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an
agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to
misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three
mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings
show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human
predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information
responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background,
influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation
of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network
for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in
complex social systems.

framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We
give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based
algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing
that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach
where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some
restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which
illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a
communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local
convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.

TL;DR: 提出NCSAC方法，将深度学习与基于规则的约束结合，通过属性增强电导度和强化学习技术提升社区搜索质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么仅依赖基于规则的约束，要么仅使用深度学习技术，需要探索如何将两者结合来提升社区搜索质量

Method: 首先提出属性增强电导度概念，结合结构邻近性和属性相似性；然后提取粗粒度候选社区；最后通过强化学习技术优化候选社区

Result: 在6个真实世界图和10个竞争对手上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面优于现有方法，F1分数提升5.3%到42.4%

Conclusion: NCSAC成功地将深度学习与基于规则的约束相结合，显著提升了社区搜索的质量

Abstract: Identifying locally dense communities closely connected to the user-initiated
query node is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing approaches
either solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep
learning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important
question is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based
constraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we
affirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called
Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as
NCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of
attribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and
external) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC
extracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the
proposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the
community search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community
through sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing
high-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten
competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy,
efficiency, and scalability. Notably, the proposed solution outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1-score improvement ranging
from 5.3\% to 42.4\%. For reproducibility purposes, the source code is

TL;DR: 本文提供了超过400种中心性度量的综合目录，旨在解决网络科学中中心性度量数量激增带来的发现性、冗余性、命名冲突、验证和可访问性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络科学中的中心性概念缺乏统一定义，导致出现了大量不同的中心性度量方法，形成了'动物园'般的混乱局面，带来了发现性、冗余性、命名冲突、验证和可访问性等多重挑战。

Method: 通过系统收集和整理，创建了包含400多种中心性度量的综合目录，提供清晰的描述和原始来源引用，并建立了Centrality Zoo交互式网站平台。

Result: 这是迄今为止最全面和系统的中心性度量整理工作，提供了超过400种中心性度量的详细目录和参考资料。

Conclusion: 该工作为网络科学研究者提供了中心性度量的标准化参考资源，通过Centrality Zoo网站促进了中心性度量的发现、比较和实现。

Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical
insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social,
transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use,
there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the
development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures
have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique
approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing
number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including
issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and
accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a
comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear
descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this
compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in
organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to
explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at
https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for
discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.

*Kosei Horikawa,Hao Li,Yutaro Kashiwa,Bram Adams,Hajimu Iida,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 对AI代理重构代码进行大规模实证研究，发现AI代理在26.1%的提交中明确进行重构，主要关注低层次、一致性导向的编辑，如变量类型更改和重命名，而非人类常见的高层次设计变更。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI编码工具正改变软件工程，但缺乏对AI代理重构实践、与人类重构比较及其对代码质量影响的实证理解。

Method: 基于AIDev数据集，分析15,451个重构实例，涵盖12,256个拉取请求和14,988次提交，对真实开源Java项目进行大规模研究。

Result: AI代理重构主要关注内部质量（可维护性52.5%，可读性28.1%），在结构指标上产生小而显著的改进，特别是中等规模变更能减少类大小和复杂度（类LOC中位数Δ=-15.25）。

Conclusion: AI代理重构是常见且有意向的活动，但偏向局部改进而非高层次设计变更，在代码质量指标上产生积极但有限的影响。

Abstract: Agentic coding tools, such as OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor, are
transforming the software engineering landscape. These AI-powered systems
function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex
development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a
cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal
code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing
adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how
agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven
refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical
gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in
real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances
across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset.
Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional
activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting
refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that
agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as
Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable
(8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level
design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations
behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns,
with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative
evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small
but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly
for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC
median $\Delta$ = -15.25).

TL;DR: 使用提示工程优化大型语言模型在软件定义车辆代码生成中的表现，无需训练即可提升模型输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件定义车辆(SDV)开发需要高效代码生成工具，但专有LLM架构限制了其在特定任务中的应用。通过提示工程可以无需训练即可优化模型表现

Method: 使用系统提示和高级提示工程技术设计提示结构，在不同模型上进行广泛实验，包括裸模型和少量样本提示策略，使用专门创建的SDV代码生成基准进行评估

Result: 少量样本提示策略的模型在定量指标上表现最佳，能更好地调整LLM输出以匹配预期结果

Conclusion: 仅通过精心设计的提示工程，无需模型训练即可显著提升LLM在SDV代码生成任务中的性能

Abstract: The emergence of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) marks a paradigm shift in
the automotive industry, where software now plays a pivotal role in defining
vehicle functionality, enabling rapid innovation of modern vehicles. Developing
SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation
and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across
domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders
their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we
propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and
redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and
efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering
techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access
to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on
different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare
models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in
generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot
prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match
the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 对npm生态系统中30,340个bug报告的分析显示，维护者通常响应积极（中位数响应率70%），但某些bug因依赖约束、贡献实践和库特定标准等原因未被解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究npm生态系统中第三方库依赖链中的bug传播问题，验证维护者是否因责任归属问题而选择不修复某些bug。

Method: 采用混合方法分析500个最依赖的npm包中的30,340个bug报告，通过挖掘仓库issue数据和定性开放编码分析未解决bug的原因。

Result: 维护者整体响应积极（项目级中位数响应率70%，IQR:55%-89%），但识别出三类导致bug未被解决的原因：贡献实践、依赖约束和库特定标准。

Conclusion: 理解维护者行为有助于制定促进更健壮和响应迅速的开源生态系统的实践，使整个社区受益。

Abstract: Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like
Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However,
this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one
library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries
that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a
bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility
within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we
investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most
depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine
repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons
behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are
generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR:
55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers.
Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved.
The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and
library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding
maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and
responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合逆向工程和大语言模型的半自动化方法，从源代码生成软件架构描述文档，解决了传统文档缺失、过时或与实现不符的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中软件架构描述文档常常缺失、过时或与系统实际实现不一致，导致开发者需要直接从源代码获取架构信息，这个过程耗时且增加认知负担，影响新开发者上手和系统长期维护。

Method: 集成逆向工程技术和大型语言模型，通过提取完整组件图、使用提示工程筛选架构重要元素、基于代码逻辑生成状态机图，恢复静态和动态架构视图。

Result: 该方法能够自动抽象组件图减少人工专家参与，并能准确表示复杂软件行为，特别是通过少量示例提示融入领域知识时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为显著减少人工工作量、增强系统理解和长期可维护性提供了可行路径，展示了LLM在软件架构文档生成方面的强大能力。

Abstract: Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the
inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level
architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective
communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often
missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation.
Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights
directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive
load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual
degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we
propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating
reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our
approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting
a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant
elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine
diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with
few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and
maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation.
This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent
capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the
reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex
software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge
through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward
significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and
long-term maintainability.

*Huimin Hu,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMapper是一个解决代码映射问题的方法，能够在不同提交之间找到特定代码区域的对应关系，不依赖于特定程序元素和编程语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术如git diff无法专注于开发者选择的特定代码区域，而其他技术又局限于特定代码元素和编程语言，限制了适用性。

Method: CodeMapper包含两个阶段：(i)通过分析差异、检测代码移动和搜索特定代码片段来计算候选区域；(ii)通过计算相似度选择最可能的目标区域。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，CodeMapper在71.0%-94.5%的情况下正确识别了预期目标区域，比现有最佳基线提高了1.5-58.8个百分点。

Conclusion: CodeMapper有效解决了代码映射问题，具有语言无关性和高准确性。

Abstract: During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a
specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to
determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a
configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the
code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this
problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file
instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other
techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g.,
methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces
CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is
independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a
code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another
commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by
analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code
fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating
similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two
new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular
programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target
region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available
baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.

TL;DR: 提出基于图检索增强生成的框架，自动将企业Web应用转换为状态-动作知识图谱，使LLM能够生成可靠、上下文感知的软件使用指导


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字采用平台需要大量人工维护，而直接使用LLM作为虚拟助手容易产生幻觉且不可靠，同时生产级LLM是黑盒API难以微调

Method: 开发图检索增强生成框架，自动提取和结构化软件界面构建状态-动作知识图谱，设计基于图的检索流程并集成到生产DAP工作流

Result: 框架能够生成基于实际软件界面的可靠指导，已与RAKAM和Lemon Learning合作开发并部署到工业用例

Conclusion: 该框架解决了企业软件指导自动化的关键挑战，提供了可扩展、稳健的解决方案，并在实际部署中验证了其有效性

Abstract: Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping
employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS
systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can
reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and
maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort.
Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing
alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software,
LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most
production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to
the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise
web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate
grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the
AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the
engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the
design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our
approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability,
robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.

Motivation: 传统代码审查劳动密集，现有自动化方法生成的评论要么偏离重点要么过于笼统，需要结合检索和生成方法的优势来改进。

Method: 使用密集检索器从代码库中选择最相关的评论，然后利用神经生成器和LLM的上下文学习能力生成最终评论。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上超越了最先进方法，分别达到12.32和12.96的BLEU-4分数，并通过人工评估和案例研究验证了有效性。

Conclusion: RARe方法通过结合检索和生成技术，有效提升了自动化代码审查的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is
labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution
to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and
retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task.
However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where
generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these
issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative
methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code
review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews
from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator,
utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to
produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively.
Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and
a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical
utility and reliability.

Conclusion: SWE-Compass通过与真实世界开发者实践对齐，为大语言模型在软件工程中的智能体编码能力评估提供了全面且实用的基准框架。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for software engineering has been
limited by narrow task coverage, language bias, and insufficient alignment with
real-world developer workflows. Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic
problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software
engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a
comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations
into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task
types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000
high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined
through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art
LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear
hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover,
by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass
provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing
agentic coding capabilities in large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaCompress框架，用于系统评估知识蒸馏压缩代码语言模型的行为保真度，发现传统准确率评估无法捕捉师生模型间的深层行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于准确率的评估方法只能提供表面性能视图，无法深入评估学生模型是否真正模仿了教师模型的预测行为和内部表示，导致压缩模型在实际部署中存在风险。

Method: 提出MetaCompress元形态测试框架，通过一组行为保持的元形态关系来系统比较师生模型的输出，评估行为保真度。

Result: MetaCompress能识别高达62%的行为差异，且学生模型在对抗攻击下性能下降高达285%，这些差异在传统准确率评估中未被发现。

Conclusion: 需要在知识蒸馏流程中引入行为保真度评估，MetaCompress为测试通过知识蒸馏获得的压缩代码语言模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their
practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow
inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these
challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as
a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a
smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree
to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal
representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current
accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality
and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity
between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically
show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,
resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,
which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we
propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically
evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student
models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate
MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular
language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation
techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress
identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring
the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation
pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing
compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波Wi-Fi的定向RTS/CTS机制无法完美解决隐藏终端问题，需要改进机制来平衡链路可靠性和网络吞吐量。

Method: 提出跨链路RTS/CTS机制，建立广义RTS/CTS硬核过程(G-HCP)模型，推导强度、平均干扰、成功概率近似值和隐藏节点期望数的解析表达式。

Result: 跨链路RTS/CTS机制确保更高的链路质量但降低网络吞吐量，定向RTS/CTS牺牲链路质量换取更高吞吐量，揭示了链路可靠性与网络吞吐量之间的基本权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为下一代WLAN标准中RTS/CTS机制的选择和优化提供了关键见解，需要在链路可靠性和网络吞吐量之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The directional RTS/CTS mechanism of mm-wave Wi-Fi hardly resolves the hidden
terminal problem perfectly.This paper proposes cross-link RTS/CTS under
multi-link operation (MLO) to address this problem and introduces a novel point
process, named the generalized RTS/CTS hard-core process (G-HCP), to model the
spatial transceiver relationships under the RTS/CTS mechanism, including the
directional case and the omnidirectional case.Analytical expressions are
derived for the intensity, the mean interference, an approximation of the
success probability, and the expected number of hidden nodes for the
directional RTS/CTS mechanism.Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the
performance difference between two RTS/CTS mechanisms.The cross-link RTS/CTS
mechanism ensures higher link quality at the cost of reduced network
throughput.In contrast, the directional RTS/CTS sacrifices the link quality for
higher throughput.Our study reveals a fundamental trade-off between link
reliability and network throughput, providing critical insights into the
selection and optimization of RTS/CTS mechanisms in next-generation WLAN
standards.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Supercomputers and Data centers have evolved
dramatically to cope with the increasing performance requirements of
applications and services, such as scientific computing, generative AI, social
networks or cloud services. This evolution have led these systems to
incorporate high-speed networks using faster links, end nodes using multiple
and dedicated accelerators, or a advancements in memory technologies to bridge
the memory bottleneck. The interconnection network is a key element in these
systems and it must be thoroughly designed so it is not the bottleneck of the
entire system, bearing in mind the countless communication operations that
generate current applications and services. Congestion is serious threat that
spoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more
dramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the
communication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion
control (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative
effects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification
(DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then
marking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which
finally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion.
While DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for
congestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which
is an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current
high-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN
closed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate
congestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control
traffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows.

Abstract: Radio Environment Map (REM) is transitioning from 5G homogeneous environments
to B5G/6G heterogeneous landscapes. However, standard Federated Learning (FL),
a natural fit for this distributed task, struggles with performance degradation
in accuracy and communication efficiency under the non-independent and
identically distributed (Non-IID) data conditions inherent to these new
environments. This paper proposes EPFL-REMNet, an efficient personalized
federated framework for constructing a high-fidelity digital twin of the 6G
heterogeneous radio environment. The proposed EPFL-REMNet employs a"shared
backbone + lightweight personalized head" model, where only the compressed
shared backbone is transmitted between the server and clients, while each
client's personalized head is maintained locally. We tested EPFL-REMNet by
constructing three distinct Non-IID scenarios (light, medium, and heavy) based
on radio environment complexity, with data geographically partitioned across 90
clients. Experimental results demonstrate that EPFL-REMNet simultaneously
achieves higher digital twin fidelity (accuracy) and lower uplink overhead
across all Non-IID settings compared to standard FedAvg and recent
state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, it significantly reduces performance
disparities across datasets and improves local map accuracy for long-tail
clients, enhancing the overall integrity of digital twin.

Abstract: In graph theory and its practical networking applications, e.g.,
telecommunications and transportation, the problem of finding paths has
particular importance. Selecting paths requires giving scores to the
alternative solutions to drive a choice. While previous studies have provided
comprehensive evaluation of single-path solutions, the same level of detail is
lacking when considering sets of paths. This paper emphasizes that the path
characterization strongly depends on the properties under consideration. While
property-based characterization is also valid for single paths, it becomes
crucial to analyse multiple path sets. From the above consideration, this paper
proposes a mathematical approach, defining a functional model that lends itself
well to characterizing the path set in its general formulation. The paper shows
how the functional model contextualizes specific attributes.

Abstract: With the large increase in the adoption of blockchain technologies, their
underlying peer-to-peer networks must also scale with the demand. In this
context, previous works highlighted the importance of ensuring efficient and
resilient communication for the underlying consensus and replication
mechanisms. However, they were mainly focused on mainstream,
Proof-of-Work-based Distributed Ledger Technologies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
  In this paper, the problem is investigated in the context of
consensus-validation based blockchains, like the XRP Ledger. The latter relies
on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism which is proven to
have a good scalability in regards to transaction throughput. However, it is
known that significant increases in the size of the XRP Ledger network would be
challenging to achieve. The main reason is the flooding mechanism used to
disseminate the messages related to the consensus protocol, which creates many
duplicates in the network. Squelching is a recent solution proposed for
limiting this duplication, however, it was never evaluated quantitatively in
real-life scenarios involving the XRPL production network. In this paper, our
aim is to assess this mechanism using a real-life controllable testbed and the
XRPL production network, to assess its benefit and compare it to alternative
solutions relying on Named Data Networking and on a gossip-based approach.

Abstract: Identifying active IPv6 addresses is challenging. Various methods emerged to
master the measurement challenge in this huge address space, including
hitlists, new probing techniques, and AI-generated target lists. In this paper,
we apply active Subnet-Router anycast (SRA) probing, a commonly unused method
to explore the IPv6 address space. We compare our results with lists of active
IPv6 nodes obtained from prior methods and with random probing. Our findings
indicate that probing an SRA address reveals on average 10% more router IP
addresses than random probing and is far less affected by ICMP rate limiting.
Compared to targeting router addresses directly, SRA probing discovers 80% more
addresses. We conclude that SRA probing is an important addition to the IPv6
measurement toolbox and may improve the stability of results significantly. We
also find evidence that some active scans can cause harmful conditions in
current IPv6 deployments, which we started to fix in collaboration with network
operators.
